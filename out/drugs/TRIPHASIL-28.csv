I don't like this_ I have never had such big boobs? When is it going to stop coz I am really not happy with this.,I hate what they are doing to my boobs,F,25,1  months,9/27/2015Email,Triphasil-28

9, 2, Birth control purposes,Terrible nausea; sporadic bleeding; I've done 2 pregnancy tests already and I hear that people have fallen preggers while on this pill...it's an internal suffering that I'm going through - and my poor fiance has just about had it with my new found erratic mood swings. I finished my 1st pack this morning and I see myself switching to a different brand. Either that or suicide.,I feel horrendous!,,26,1  months,3/18/2015,Triphasil-28
10, 2, birth control,I used triphasil for 4 good years_ and like last year I was vomiting every morning and I still feel very dizzy_ in January I realised my breasts were getting bigger and I took several pregnancy tests and were negative then I went to the doc and she told me its the side effect of the pill. I hate this pill,,F,27,4  days,2/20/2015,Triphasil-28
11, 1, skin clearing and regulate hormones,Ever since using Triphasil_ I've experienced persistent_ recurring headaches and dizziness which has limited my concentration span. I've also experienced double vision and constant tiredness even when I have just woken up from a long rest. One moment I would be busy studying and the next moment I would find myself thinking about something irrelevant which explains the effects on my concentration span.,These are all among the SEVERE side effects of Triphasil. I do not regard these side effects as a coincidence because right before using Triphasil I barely use to experience headaches_ a quick nap would energize me for the next few hours and I use to be able to focus on the task at hand. Three and a half months ago I was on Trigestrel  and I did not experience any side effects. I only started using Triphasil because the nurse did not have any Trigestrel stock. I personally would not recommend Triphasil to anyone_ but our bodies are all different and respond to medication differently_ so you wont know unless you try it for yourself.,F,21,2  weeks 1X D,11/4/2014Email,Triphasil-28

14, 5, Contraceptive,No side effects whatsoever_ no pregnancy_ mimics natural body sequence_ helped clear up skin_ cheap!! All people going off about this pill should not say its bad. Everybody takes differently to hormones within their body because we are all made up of our unique & specified genetic makeup.  I'm pretty sure it's a given that any body trying new hormonal contraceptive will expect either a positive or negative change. Instead of saying other people not to try it_ go to your GP instead to find the right pill for you_ they know better :),,F,20,4  years,7/27/2014,Triphasil-28

I started taking it again in my early twenties for about 2 years. I really had no terrible side effects to speak of - but after my second child I have been diagnosed with Hashimoto disease. This does not run in my family so it could be because of the pill so long ago. Researching to see if there is anyone else out there with this as I am thinking of putting my daughter on it but not with long term side effects.,F,35,5  yearsu/k 1X D,2/12/2013Email,Triphasil-28

36, 4, Yes,brief irritable mood prior to period starting_ breast tenderness_ discharge,"I took triphasil and then switched to trivora when they stopped making it. The pill has been great to me. I have normal irritbality and breast tenderness prior to my period starting. I've been on the pill for 13 years now have experienced decreased libido_ but I think that is ""normal"" for having taken a pill for so long. The only think I don't like is increased discharge as a PMS symptom_ it sucks but other than that_ no acne_ no cramps_ sleep great_ no depression_ no aggression_ no nausea - I've heard so many other horror stories on other pills!",F,30,13  years,2/5/2009,Triphasil-28

38, 1, triphasil-21 for BC and skin,Noticed cramps 2 weeks before my period and also I started having a brownish discharge which I didn't have with tri-cyclen(weight gain).Felt nauseated while taking the pills and my period wasn't even close.This was for the first 3 months. Been taking it for 3 years and the acne on my back cleared up and on my face it was reduced.After year 2 I started to get mad for no reason. I'd be happy one moment and then my boyfriend would do something small that usually I'd find annoying_with the pills I'd yell at him.I'd get so mad it would cause my heart to beat very rapidly and then I'd be unable to breath.It felt like an anxiety attack. Lost sex drive which could have been due to the vaginal dryness I felt_ and it made condoms sting.Got a lot of bladder and yeast infections.Could time them once a month like my period.Still had the discharge 2 weeks before my period which was annoying.Period was shortened from 8 days to 3 or 4. Only benefit though.Breasts got a little bigger_so did everything,Stopped them Apr.2008 when I noticed that the 4 packs I had left had expired in February.Immediately felt happier_but then I noticed my hair was starting to fall out in the shower in clumps!This went on for 8 months!Now my hair_ which was once thick_ is now feeling very thin and I can see through to the scalp in the front along the hairline.It's about 2 inches back where my hair is very sparse.Periods also very irregular.They started being late about 2 weeks and then sometimes they were late up to a month.Constantly worried that I was pregnant though I never was and had no reason to think I was because I always used protection_ but nothing is full proof.Skin also broke out very badly.Had a lot on my face and some on my back.It's Jan 09 and the acne is reduced_ my period is some what regulated_ but now lasts anywhere from 8-14 days.The last one I had was 14 days of light flow on and off.It would go for 2 days then stop for 2 days.I now feel paranoid every time my hair comes out.It's not,F,27,3  years,1/10/2009,Triphasil-28

41, 5, first birth control prescribed,i started taking triphasil at 16_ had initial water weight gain but lost it shortly afterward. other than that_ it took my 2 week long periods down to 3 days flat. i loved it.,i took triphasil for almost 4 years until they discontinued it. after they stopped making it i took trivora and the side effects were horrifying. a little difference does go a long way. too long id say. i had bad bad cramps near my kidneys 2 hours on the dot after id take the pill and become nauseated with additional stomach pain and that would last about 6-8 hours where i could barely move. i felt like i was dying! i now take trinessa_ generic for ortho tri-cyclen and i have no side effects from it_ besides again_ initial weight gain but my period is at least 7 days long up to 10 days once in awhile. i wish they would bring triphasil back. it was by far the best.,F,21,3  years,7/21/2008Email,Triphasil-28
42, 5, Periods 2x monthly_ bad PMS,Tri-levlen 28 was the ONLY birth control pill I would take that would control both my bad PMS and having two periods a month (really!). I took it for 15 years until the pharmacy all of a sudden gave me a generic version one day_ which I could not tolerate and went into horrible depressions before and after my period. This has been the case for TWO YEARS. I've even lost my job twice due to the depression. My gyno put me on Lybrel to stop my periods. I went through hell on the third month_ lost my job then (it was like going through a fast version of menopause). Now_ I'm going having week-long pms-like symptoms every other week. It's hell. I'm calling Bayer and asking them to bring it back!,The medical industry does not fully understand or respect how hormones can affect women_ even the smallest amounts! Clearly_ if a generic has something minor different from the brand AND affects a woman so much_ then it's time to take us more seriously!,F,40,15  years,5/24/2008,Triphasil-28
43, 5, had been taking triphasil since 16,no side effects at all. had been on this BC pill for 15 years. did experience however about 6 months ago my period coming later. i'd finish the pack of 28 and wouldn't get my period until day 2 of new pack. found it strange that after so many years of being on triphasil that i'd experience such a change. dr prescribed yasmin which i did not like and now trying loestrin (on day 1 of pack 1 today).,overall i must say this BC pill was fantasic! did get a bit moody (angry_ upset_ crying) a week before my period would arrive but i knew when in the pill pack they'd be coming so i'd be careful. sex drive was great. no major complaints!!,F,32,15  years,5/4/2008Email,Triphasil-28

I would recommend this to anyone--however_ I know from experience that not one b/c works for everyone. Find one that works_ and stick with it! :),F,24,1  months,1/15/2008Email,Triphasil-28
48, 5, ,I have been taking Triphasil for about 8 years and I have never had any problems with it.  3 days before the end of the cycle I had just one day of mood swings.  I had to stop taking it a year ago because of possible complications with other medicines.  Being off of it was an extreme shock to my system for the last year (horrible cramps that I hadn't experienced ever before and massive mood swings for a week leading up to my period). Went back on it 2 months ago and everything was back to normal.  Then I go to get my refill today and heard it was really discontinued and that I need to see a doctor to get a recommendation for another pill.  Nice to know.  I know this will mess up my system again.

With the shortage_ I now switched to Triquillar (which is the same as Triphasial but it's made by a different manufacturer) and it's the same as Triphasil!,F,24,1.5  years,11/27/2006,Triphasil-28

I have been on it for 6 yrs now and recently been switched to TRIQUILAR.  I'm worried that switching like this will alter the efficacy.  Apparently it does not_ but I am  worried.

78, 1, Birth control & to regulate periods,I had a STROKE after taking this contraceptive for ONLY 2 1/2 months!!!!!!!!!!!  I had taken Lo-estrin FE for about 14 years and had no problems. Was switched to this to regulate periods & had a stroke at 38 years old...PLEASE READ ADDT'L COMMENTS!,I was not at risk for a stroke;no high blood pressure_ no diabetes_ don't smoke. I experienced a BAD pain in my left calf that lasted about 1 day.  Just a few days later_ I had an ischemic stroke.My cardiologist thinks there is a STRONG link between my change in contraceptive to this and the blood clot that caused my stroke. I have a patent foramen ovale_ which MANY people have & never have a problem! I did not know this until the stroke.The blood clot passed through this PFO & into my brain.Would I have had a clot if it weren't for these pills....We cannot be 100% sure_ but it sure is a coincidence. Please be careful on these!My life has changed.I will be on Coumadin for the rest of my life!,F,38,2  months,11/2/2006,Triphasil-28
79, 1, Increase sex drive,HAIR LOSS! No sex drive. Less moody than Ortho Tri Cyclen. Regular periods. No nausea_ vomiting_ or headaches. Acne was the same as on OTC.,I went on this pill to increase my sex drive and it didn't work. It did_ however_ make my hair fall out. My hairline has receded in certain places and my hair is much thinner. I thought it was normal shedding until it didn't stop and half my hairline receded farther back than the other half. I was on it for six months when i noticed the major shedding and hairline. I recently got off it and I pray my hair will grow back. If it hadn't been for this I would liked the pill. I had no other bad side effects. My sex drive is zero on every pill I've taken so this pill was not different. I was a little less moody on it than on Ortho Tri Cyclen. I had regular periods that weren't heavy but weren't really really light either.,F,26,7  months,10/31/2006,Triphasil-28

I have been having skin problems lately_ but I'm not too sure if it is related to the birth control.  I am also having problems getting it through my pharmacist.  Pretty sure if you google it_ you can find out what's going on.  But overall_ it's great...and does the job well!,F,23,1.5  years,9/24/2006,Triphasil-28
82, 5, Birth Control,I have not experienced many side effects.  My breasts get a little tender and look bigger (no complaints there!) mid pack but this happens whether I'm on the pill or not. I'm a bit crabby the week before my period but nothing worth being concerned about. I never really had acne but when I did go off thi spill I noticed that I got pimples and when I went back on they cleared up and my skin is pefect. No nausea and I've never gained or lost any weight while being on Triphasil.,This is a great pill. My GYN put me on this pill when I was 20 and other than coming off it to get pregnant I've never had any issues.  I did try Ortho 777 after haviong my second child and I had break through bleeding for 3 months. I switched back on Triphasil it all stopped.,F,35,15  years,9/22/2006,Triphasil-28

Can anyone please tell me where I can find it as I don't think I can live without it.  Six weeks ago when I was told it was discontinued I started taking Trivora_ a generic_ that was supposed to be the same.  Well let me tell you that IT IS NOT!!!!  For the past month I have been sick to my stomach eating constantly so my stomach does not hurt which caused me to gain 8-10 lbs.  I was clammy all of the time breaking out in a sweat when I would eat.  I was eating so much that my stomach would eat up hurting from too much food.  Because of the stomach problems I could not concentrate and barely could function.  After seeing my primary care physician she told me my problem was probably hormonal and that is when I told her I changed birth control pills.  Last night I decided not to take the Trivora any more and GUESS WHAT????  After skipping just one dose I woke up normal this morning with no,F,47,27  years,9/12/2006Email,Triphasil-28

I never had acne before_ but this pill keeps my skin pretty clear_ but I do get some pimples during the week of my period. I do think this pill makes me incredibly moody_ even depressed. My weight changes constantly. Some days I have no appetite at all and other days I can't stop eating. I'm about to switch to a different pill_ so I'll see how that works.,I'm glad I found this website because I've been secretly battling depression for a long time and now I realize it could be because of the pill.

102, 2, Birth Control,I was on this birth control pill from age 20 to 35. It was FINE the first 10 years ..... then at 30 I was plagued with vaginal infections_ vaginal dryness_ and urinary tract infections. My sex drive went to zero. My physician told me it was all in my head. When I asked him if I should change pills because I had been on the same pill for 15 years - he said no. I became more tired_ very skinny_ run-down_ and had tons of infections. Finally a few days after my 35th birthday I collapsed. The attending physician in the hospital said the first thing he was going to do is take me off my birth control pill. I had something similar to toxic shock caused by the bacteria in my vagina (naturally occurring - not sexually transmitted) that had travelled into my kidneys. Once I went off the pill - I gained 10 pounds_ had more energy_ beautiful skin. I'd like to go on the pill again ... but I'm not sure which one.,I would NOT reocmmend this pill for anyone over 30.
