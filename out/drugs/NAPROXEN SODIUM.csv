0, 1, Fibromyalgia,Severe vomiting_ diarrhea,I had been taking one dose of 440mg per day (2 pills) for my Fibromyalgia pain.  It helped somewhat to kick the pain down a notch or so.  Nothing spectacular.  Then my doctor encouraged me to increase my dosage to 440mg twice a day (4 pills).  I was really uneasy about doing this_ because after taking the regular_ lower dose for several days in a row (which I always try to avoid)_ I noticed severe diarrhea. But I decided to try double-dosing at my doctor's recommendation - and I have never been SO VIOLENTLY SICK with vomiting in my entire life!I would caution anyone taking this medication to ONLY take the LOWEST prescribed dosage (directions on the bottle say 1-2 pills every 12 hours).If your doctor increases your dosage of ANYTHING_ take it with a grain of salt and do what's right for you!  If you're already having symptoms at a lower dosage_ it's probably a really bad idea to increase the dosage_ no matter what medication it is!I feel really stupid for going ahead with double-dosing_ even though my doctor told me it was alright.  I knew in my gut that it was not_ and I did it anyway.  Serves me right I guess!,F,29,2  days440mg 2X D,1/26/2015,Naproxen sodium

3, 1, migraines,I developed an inability to hold urine_ also severe bruising even with simple pressure to the skin. I have permanently damaged my bladder.,I misunderstood the doctor's instructions_ which were to take it twice a day. I did not know I was only supposed to take one_ not two at a time. Also that twice a day meant every 12 hours instead of a 4 hour span.  I felt it could have easily killed me from internal bleeding. I lost the protective lining in my bladder and after 15 years I still have blood in my urine. I can no longer take aspirin_ ibuprofin or anything acidic that can irritate the bladder or thin the blood.,F,62,2  weeks 1X D,5/24/2012,Naproxen sodium
