0, 3, Acid Reflux,Was given Rx for Protonix and pharmacy told me to start with Pepcid Complete as Protonix takes at least 24 hours to work and I was in major pain. Pepcid worked very well and quickly. Was better after about 4 weeks on Protonix and used Pepcid only as necessary for a few months. All symptoms went away for 7 months and then returned and I restarted taking Pepcid 2x day. Also experienced dizziness and couldn't catch my breath at night. Noticed that if I ate very lightly and didn't need the Pepcid_ I would lose the other symptoms too. Also bought a bottle that tasted oddly and did not work at all so I called the company. They had a myriad of questions and wanted my MD to send a complete history to them! Do they know something we don't? I merely wanted a replacement bottle.,Great product for the short term but I am wondering about it's long term ill effects.,M,60,3  years1 tablet 2X D,10/22/2010,Pepcid complete
