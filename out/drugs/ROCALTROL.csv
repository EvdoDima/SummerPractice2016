0, 5, very low blood calcium levels,Absolutely none,1969 I had thyroid Ca; parathyroid gland was involved & my body does not retain calcium well.  My blood calcium levels hovered around 6.  This caused tetany & made me feel awful; severe tingling everywhere (no outward signs of this_ but I could feel tingling in my face_ stomach_ legs_ etc.) and occasional hand muscle spasms.  After taking .50 mg 2x daily_ within 4 wks tingling/spasms ceased & blood work has been 8-9 (10 is perfect).  Switching to new a Md._ an endocrinologist_ gave me my life back.  Former Mds were of no help to solve this problem & some even thought I caused this problem by not taking my calcium lactate meds; I NEVER missed a dose!    Very frustrating and some didn't know what tetany was; they thought I was saying tetnus.   Go figure!  I know I will be taking this the rest of my life.   My only caveat would be to women who plan to or are pregnant.   I would refrain from taking it then_ as there are risks to the fetus.  The formation of the fetus will actually remedy tetany during pregnancy.    And yes_ I had that experience while pregnant with my son.   The tetany symptoms will return after delivery & you can resume taking rocaltrol.,F,63,15  days25 mg 2X D,6/2/2013Email,Rocaltrol
