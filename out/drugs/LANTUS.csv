9, 1, Type II Diabetes,The major side effect was that I gained 37 pounds in 11 months_ going from a slim 169 to a fat 206_ while taking it.  The extra wait rendered Lantus non-effective for me.  I gained this weight even as I swam regularly 3 - 5 times a week.,As of yesterday_ my Dr agreed that the added wait was not good for me and removed me from Lantus and returned me to Metformin twice a day and Victoza at the lowest level_ once a day.

14, 3, Type II - Pills no longer effective,I have experienced extreme hunger_ and gained over 20 pounds in four months. The weight gain is mainly in my stomach in the form of bloating. Most recently I have developed joint pain in my shoulders and neck_ which has made sleeping very uncomfortable.,I take Lantus in the evening and my blood sugar levels were consistently normal in the mornings (below 120)_ however after three months my overall 1AC was still over 10.  My Dr then put me on Novolog at 7 units_ three times a day.  I have not had another 1AC since the addition of Novolog.  My worst concern is the weight gain which I can't seem to loose.  I started Lantus at a comfortable 159 and now I weigh 181.  (Going in the wrong direction).,M,54,4  months50 Units 1X D,4/23/2015,Lantus

20, 1, type 2 diabetes,After using Lantus for about the first 2 months_ everything was going great. But for the last 2 months I've developed itching over my entire body. I called my Doctor and he gave me some prescription creme to use on my body to control the itching_ but as it is_ it did not work. I've spend a lot of time on the internet looking for answers of what is causing my itch. Now I find that the itching over my entire body is a very rare condition caused by Lantus injections. It does surprise me that my doctor_ who recommended me to take this product_ is not aware of the side effects. I know that I'm suppose to call my doctor about stopping this drug_ but since  he felt no interest to call me back_ I just quit tonight.

26, 3, Type II,Burning at injection site/ mild bloating/ mild constipation/ painful gas,I am still adjusting to the medication and I still have not reached a therapeutic level that controls glucose levels completely. The side effects aren't necessarily a deal breaker IF it will eventually be effective at controlling levels. It may be my physician is cautious and is sneaking up to the proper dose from the bottom but I am disappointed so far in it's effects.

Also it seems that a lot of the ""side effects"" mentioned more than likely are not caused by the drug but by the insecurity of the patient.

It has effectively lowered my high blood sugar to normal levels! I was struggling with very high sugar from 200 to300 range before lantus. It works so well for me my levels are that of a person without diabetes now. Once you find the dose that's right for you its amazing how effective lantus is! I really like the fact that lantus doesn't peak like other insulins so I don't get unwanted lows while taking lantus! Just one shot a day covers me all day! I'm on a sliding scale of humulin but rarely have to take it because lantus does such a great job! I truely recomend lantus to all who are struggling with high blood sugar. The side effects are so minimumal its really a great drug. I use lantus in the solostar pen and its sooo. Easy to use. The small needle is so painless and the pen is so nice it can be taken anywhere and it looks like a regular marking pen! Its soo convienant. So much easier than vials and syringes! With lantus_ once you find the dose correct for you_ its a God send! Don't give up just do some trials with your doctor to find your dose and once you do_ your sugar will run normal again with lantus! I can not stress enough how well this drug has been doing for me! No more struggle with high numbers for me! I think the most important thing to remember is be patient because it does take a little time to find the correct dose for your bodys needs.

By the end of day 4_ I had a huge anxiety attack and felt faint while driving home from the store. I didn't think that I would make the 1/2 mile but did. I immediately checked my BS and it was 140 so I wasn't hypoglycemic. I also take 40 mg of Inderal 4x a day so I can image what it would have been like if I had not been on it. I'm sensitive to any stimulants including my own adrenaline so this might just be specific to those with the same condition. I did notice a new insulin advertised on TV and it had 'jittery' as one of the side effects where as Lantus doesn't. I wonder if it's unreported. I stopped taking it.,,F,60,4  days,10/18/2007,Lantus
61, 4, Type 1 Diabetes,sudden drop in blood sugar levels_ burning (mostly during the first few weeks I started taking it),When I was first diagnosed with Type-1 Diabetes_ I was prescribed Lantus as my long acting insulin_ and Novolog as my short acting insulin.  When I first started taking Lantus_ I would notice a mild burning sensation after the injection.  That burning sensation doesn't happen that often anymore.  The other thing I notice is that generally when my blood sugar levels are around 120 or lower I feel shaky_ along with the rest of the symptoms of a low blood sugar level.  I generally have to eat something when my blood sugar levels are stabilized or else my blood sugar levels will dip down past 90.  I have never been on any other long acting insulin.  I take 32 units of Lantus every 24 hours.  As for the Novolog_ I take one unit per 15 grams of carbohydrate.  When my blood sugar levels are high_ I take one unit of Novolog for every 50 points over the 120 reading on my glucometer.

Only problem with splitting up the doses though is the complications it makes from travelling and having to keep the lantus cool.

64, 5, Type 1 DM,none that I know of. Although I noticed that it goes bad quicker than other insulins.,I usually eat 2 big meals a day_ plus 2-3 very light snacks (e.g. 1 oz almonds_ fruit_ cheeze_ etc.) Prior to using Lantus_ I was on Humalog 75/25 mix. Now I take the pure Humalog (5-25 units depending on food) before each meal_ and 20-25 units of Lantus at bedtime. Very rare cases of hypo/hyper-glycemia now. Maintaining a good glucose level throughout the day was never this easy. Though traveling is a bit difficult because Lantus needs to be refridgerated at all times. Plus it's not cheap. This isn't a cure-all miracle drug for diabetes but it's almost like having a pump as it really levels out your glucose level nicely.WARNING:  don't mix it with other insulin -- don't use the same needle for different insulins. Also_ don't let it out of the fridge for too long... it'll go bad really quickly!,M,36,1  years,1/24/2005,Lantus

67, 5, Type 1 Diabetes,When taking Lantus in conjunction with Humalog insulin_ be more cautious of low blood sugar reactions.,Thi insulin provides an excellent_ long-lasting basal dose of insulin.  It is convienently taken once a day_ at bedtime.  However_some users may not get adequate control with one dose daily and must split their insulin dose to a twice-a-day schedule.  It's like the pump in the way you receive constant coverage.  It has helped this brittle diabetic lower her HgA1C to an 8!  Hooray!  My neuropathy and blurry vision have also improved.  If your internist recommends Lantus definately give it a try.,F,35,2  years,8/11/2004Email,Lantus
