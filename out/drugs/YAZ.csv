0, 1, Birth control,,I decided to research the side effects on YAZ_ and instead i found a bunch of news articles about how there have been over 8_000 lawsuits from people getting blood clots and having strokes and all kinds of other health problems. 8_000 lawsuits!!! And those are the people who were lucky and lived_ there have been over 200 women who died after taking it. There has never been this many lawsuits against any other birth control. The progestin they use in YAZ is the newest kind not used in any other birth control_ and clearly its really dangerous. I would stay so far away from this pill its not even funny.,F,21,  1X D,10/9/2015Email,Yaz
1, 5, PMDD,None,YAZ was the first and only thing that worked against my severe PMDD symptoms. My life used to feel unlivable due to these symptoms so I am extremely grateful for YAZ_ and will be using it until I try for pregnancy (which will be a long time away).,F,20,2.5  years 1X D,7/8/2014,Yaz
2, 5, von Willebrands disease,Weight gain which killed my confidence. Sorted it out by working out 3times a week which makes me quite happy. Worked wonders for my periods and my blood clotting as I have an increased bleeding tendency. I used to pass out from the blood loss_ and now my periods are like everybody else's! Reduced nose bleeds_ and less bruising.,,F,24,1  years0_02/3MG,9/5/2013,Yaz
3, 1, birth control,Frequent leg cramps_ severely low libido_ vaginal dryness_ tender breasts_ PCOS_ Hypothyroidism_ Hormonal imbalance_ pituitary problems_ lactation_ chronic yeast infections_ painful intercourse.,Yaz ruined my life because it caused all the problems I have. I was only on it for three years and I had to stop. I gained 50 pounds and my body is a hormonal mess because it upped the testosterone production_ among other things. It made me hyperthyroid_ which no one has in my family. I had SEVERE LEG CRAMPS while on YAZ and felt so depressed. Then I started to get chronic yeast infections_ which to this day doctors can't explain and said it was all in my head when I mentioned that sex was severely painful. I felt like someone was literally stabbing the inside of my vagina,F,25,3  years 1X D,9/2/2013,Yaz

5, 1, birth control,Fainting_ Constantly Getting Sick_ Stomach Problems_ Losing my Hair_ Depression_ Anxiety_ Panic Attacks_ Heart Palpitations.... just to name a few.,I truly believe this pill almost killed me.  Took me 2 years to figure out it had slowly begun to cause ALL of my health problems.  This pill has already been linked to the death of 200 women in the US.  I would NEVER recommend this pill to any women.  Please don't put yourself through what I went through.  It is a very_ very dangerous drug.  Sadly_ I am still recovering almost 3 years later.,F,28,  1X D,12/19/2012,Yaz

For the first 2 years I didn't have too many side effects but for the past 3 years I can't say the same. I'm 23 and have no sex drive. That's not right at all. I'm ALWAYS tired and have extreme cramping which feels like knives stabbing into my stomach. My flow has increased so drastically_ that I have 2 change ""super"" tampon every 2 hours.

I discontinued 10 days later because of the hunger_ and I am STILL feeling the effects! It has now been three weeks since I have been off of it_ and the side effects are still here.

9, 1, baby stopper,No libido_ mood swings_ weight gain,I was taking Yasmin for about 5 years but decided to switch to Yaz so I would get shorter periods.  Worst. Idea. Ever.

10, 1, prevent pregnancy,severe mood swings_ slight weight gain,The slight weight gain doesn't bother me. You're going to get that with any birth control. But this pill made me crazy. I'm not a very emotional person and it made me want to cry all the time_ yell at someone_ etc. It got to the point that I couldn't take it anymore and just threw them away. I'd rather be on nothing at all then be on yaz.,F,23,7  months 1X D,7/25/2012,Yaz

My sex drive was been greatly reduced while being on this pill_ although I never associated that with Yaz until reading these reviews. My period was never regular on Yaz either. Then in May 2012 my gyno took me off of Yaz (she is taking all her patients off_ if that tells you anything.) I have since had severe withdrawal symptoms starting with persistent shortness of breath_ despite my o2 levels being 100%. I also have severe anxiety and have had to go on anti-depressants. I am very emotional. My body is so fatigued. My body would shake and I had pressure in my chest. I developed acid reflux_ which I had never had before. I experienced a strange numb/cold sensation in my ears/chest/back of neck. I have been to the ER 2x_ a cardiologist_ a family Dr_ a homeopathic Dr_ had a EKG_ stress test_ echo_ blood work_ and CT. All of which came back fine. I used to be athletic and love running- now I do good to make it around the block. After almost a month all symptoms have went away_ except for bizarre chest discomfort & the persistent shortness of breath. DO NOT TAKE YAZ- I would take acne anyday over this torture. After this_ I will never put another synthetic hormone in my body.,F,24,3  years 1X D,6/27/2012Email,Yaz
13, 2, Birth Control,STOMACH PROBLEMS: Diarrhea_ Nausea_ Vomiting; Decreased Sex Drive; Anxiety; Weight Loss; Resolved Acne Problems,The first month 2 months I was on Yaz I loved it_ these last 2 months_ however_ have been a nightmare. My doctors and I have been scratching our heads wondering why I've had consistent diarrhea for almost a month now (which has lead to 12 pounds lost in about 2 weeks time_ and it's been a struggle to keep my weight where it is now). Suddenly_ it struck me the other day_ I only started having all the side effects (stomach problems_ anxiety_ etc.) since I changed my birth control. I read up on the association of Yaz! and stomach problems and apparently it's relatively common. I've stopped taking Yaz!_ hopefully that means these problems will stop within the next several days.

I was on it for a year and a half and my first few months were okay too.. that's when it all started... I was constantly getting allergies_ having diarrhea_ stomach pain_ headaches_ hives_ excessive thirst_ and anxiety.  Then_ I thought I was just developing depression_ as I became sad all of the time.  I had so many problems sexually_ which I never had before_ including vaginal dryness and an inability to orgasm.  Finally_ I became more and more exhausted - first_ I couldn't go to the gym_ then_ anything other than going to work and straight back home was hard.  My muscles were in constant pain on this pill.,F,24,  1X D,4/19/2012,Yaz

At that point_ I had to quit my job because I was so sick.  I spent over $10_000 in medical tests that year.  It was a nightmare.  I thought I might be dying.  I came off_ only to find that I started feeling better again.  This pill was absolutely horrifying for me.  It put me through the worst physical_ mental_ and financial pain of my life.,F,26,2  years 1X D,4/4/2012,Yaz
17, 1, Periods,Passing out every 2 hours!,I have used contraceptives for years and was taken off of Ortho Evra due to the blood clot warning and put on Yaz.  Everything seemed fine the first week then this horrible side effect appeared! I am completely healthy and don't smoke etc and was experiencing episodes of dizziness to completely losing consiousness and even landed in the hospital!  I googled Yaz side effects as I had not changed anything in my lifestyle and it came up with causing blood sugar levels to drop. (That's what it says I swear!! But it was more than a simple drop!!!)  I had to drink Coke every time I started to feel sluggish or I would pass out-after discontinuing it took 10 days for the symptoms to fully disappear and I am fine now.

I finally put the pieces together after having doctors deny that it could be causing any of these problems.  I was completely healthy before this pill and became VERY ILL with numerous problems while taking it.  My personality and mood changed dramatically and I became very depressed and unlike myself.  Once coming off many of the symptoms went away_ but I have been off for 2 years now and I am still not 100% back to myself.  I am getting there slowly though.

First 2-3months were ROUGH!. experienced mood swings_ depression and a huge drop in libido. I decided to stick it out through those symptoms because I thought my body just needed to get used to medication. Should have quit from the beginning but I suffered from mood swings and low libido even before Yaz so wasnt certain if it was the pills or just me. Mood swings and depression got better after about 3 months. Increased appetite and low libido remained. Didn't gain weight on this pill_ but i work out and weight lift regularly. Months 3-6 started getting migraines during the inactive pill week_ headaches disappeared 1-2 days after I start a new pack of pills. Doctor thinks I have estrogen-withdrawal headaches from Yaz. switched me to Mircette which I will start tomorrow.

24, 1, Contraception,Anxiety_ Depression_ OCD,I posted back on 9/15/10. I stopped Yaz on 9/18/10. When I got off_ I noticed is that my depression peaked and I lost a ton of hair. I switched to Levora the week after and stayed on that until the end of February 2011. My anxiety and depression lessened_ but not enough_ so I switched to Zovia. I stayed on that from the beginning of March to the first week of April. I was still having panic attacks and was emotionally numb (even though it was a lot less severe than when I was on Yaz)_ so I stopped taking the pill altogether on 4/7/11. I'm almost 8 months off hormonal birth contrrol and I have to say that getting off was the greatest decision that I've ever made. The first few months were tough as my body went into withdrawal and my hormones were out of whack - I lost a lot of hair_ I had breakouts_ and I still had some depression and panic issues. As time went on though_ things got better. My depression is now completely gone and I had my last panic attack in August - took my last Xanex then and haven't needed it since. I also see a naturopathic doctor who figured out that the pill had depleted some vitamins and that I had a hormonal imbalance as well. I'm on an all natural regiment to rebalance my system. I still suffer from mild anxiety_ but I'm hoping that with time_ I can ease out of it as it's gotten significantly better.If you have problems on Yaz_ contact your doctor and stop taking it - don't wait!

25, 3, hormonal contraception_ PMDD_ acne,PMS worse (in terms of being weepy and easily upset); amenorrhea after 1.5 years use; leg cramps; slightly worsened depression and anxiety; extremely light period (when I get it); breakthrough bleeding occurs for me if I am lazy in dose scheduling (and say take a pill 3-4 hours later than yesterday_ repeat for 2 days = breakthrough bleeding).  So you need to be very consistent with dosing at the same time (within 2 hours of previous dose) to prevent breakthrough bleeding.  It sucks having 2 mini periods/month.,Read that it caused migraines_ but I had them way before Yaz_ and I didn't take it continuously through 2010_ and stopping the drug didn't decrease migraines.I like Yaz because I do not get the water retention evident from other pills I've tried (Ortho-Tri-Cyclen Lo_ Alesse_ Yasmine).  Of all of those pills_ Yasmine drove me the most crazy - mood swings_ irritability_ extreme anxiety_ constant panic attacks_ depression_ crying (all sudden onset and all during the 12 days I took Yasmine).  Yaz has been the best_ as I hate weight gainer drugs_ and it seems to keep water weight off well in me (perhaps the increased potassium levels? dunno).

26, 3, Avoid pregnancy,I got on it at age 14. Super young but I was sexually active & didn't want to risk getting pregnant. YAZ was great! No weight gain. No mood changes. No hair loss. No anything!!! I am now 19 & gained a few pounds. I'm 5'8 & 138 pounds. I'd like to be 10 pounds lighter. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LOSE WEIGHT. My calorie intake is 700 & I exercise. The YAZ doesn't allow my body to lose weight & worst of all I recently got severe cellulite. I feel that being on a birth control for so long has changed my body. I never had cellulite & now it's all over my butt & thighs. I am getting off in a week to see how things go. I would recommend it but only for a short period of time. Do not exceed a few years like I did.,,F,19,5  years 1X D,10/14/2011Email,Yaz
27, 1, PMDD,Severe depression_ suicidal thoughts_ increase in PMDD,I was prescribed YAZ last year due to the fact that I suffer severe PMDD and no SSRI's seem to have worked for me. When I first started taking it I thought I had found the miracle drug. I had light periods_ no cramping_ and best of all.. no pmdd or pms symptoms at all. I loved it. After about two to three months things slowly began to change. I noticed I was severly depressed ALL THE TIME. About absolutely nothing. I was like a walking empty shell. I couldn't feel happiness_ sadness_ joy_ fear_ excitement_ NOTHING. I was a zombie. On top of that I was extremely tired all the time_ and all I wanted to do was sleep. When I did sleep I had strange dreams that woke me in cold sweats. Finally_ I called my doctor and I told him what I was feeling and he told me to discontinue the YAZ right away_ which I did. It took approx. 3 weeks for my body to become back to normal after stopping the YAZ. When it did become back to normal I noticed the PMDD seemed to have disappeared as well. Months went by and I was a normal female with normal PMS symptoms. Then PMDD came creeping back slowly_ and hit me like a brick wall. Its by far worse than I ever knew it could be. It intensified greatly_ and to this day I am battling major depression and suicidal thoughts every month_ and I have yet to find something that can help. YAZ ruined my life_ and I dont suggest it to anyone!!!!!!!,F,27,4  months 1X D,10/7/2011Email,Yaz
28, 5, birth control,lighter periods_ increased breast size_ controls PMS symptoms_ slight decrease in sex drive.,I have been on Yaz for a little over a month and I LOVE it.  It's easily the best birth control pill I have taken.  I have been other pills over the years and they all have made me extremely irratable with major mood swings.  This pill seems to help control my moods.  I was actually taking welbutrin before to help with mild depression and mood swings and have since stopped since taking Yaz.  I have not gained any weight and my breast seem to have increased in size a bit.  The only negative side effect I can report is a slight decrease in my sex drive.  I would highly recommend this pill for any women who have struggled with mood swings and weight gain while on other birth control pills.,F,31,35  days3MG/0.02MG 1X D,9/26/2011,Yaz
29, 1, Heavy Painful Periods,Massive HAIR LOSS_ 2 Breast Lumps_ Gall Bladder Issues_  Psychotic Mood Swings_ Cleared up acne_ Short light periods_ Increased cup size_ Decreased libido,The first few months I was extremely irritable_ violently angry_ and depressed.  After awhile I got used to it and felt fine_ maybe even a little bit too emotionless with no libido. My acne prone skin became flawless and my periods short_ light with minimal cramping.  After the first year I did develop what the doctors think is endometriosis_ intense debilitating abdominal pain along with gas.  Not sure if this is related or not since doctors usually prescribe BC to treat endo...  After 3 years I developed breast pain and 2 lumps which had to be biopsied and I still have the ugly scars 1.5years later.  I started having an intolerance to fatty foods_ which indicates a gall bladder issue.  I could not eat icecream anymore without getting really ill.  I started noticing hair loss.  I don't know if it was gradual or all of a sudden_ but I do know I loss over half my hair. It's been a year and a half after I've stopped taking yaz and it still has not gotten better.  I am so depressed about this.  It took a year+ for my hormones to go back to normal.  My face is breaking out bad again and I'm having heavier and heavier periods.  I also have a slight melasma on/along my upper lip. The doctors don't tell you about the negative effects of these pills even though some are very common and even permanent.

I became incredibly ill while taking this pill and doctors could not figure out why.  I was constantly getting sick while on Yaz_ although I had been healthy before.  I was always tired_ had severe stomach problems_ anxiety attacks_ and depression.  I could barely work out and if I did my muscles would hurt.  It took me a YEAR to recover from the horrible side-effects of this pill once I came off.  I did however_ notice vast improvements within 2 DAYS of stopping the pill!  DO NOT TAKE!

While I was on yaz (not after I stopped taking it) my hair started POURING off of my head. I stopped when it didn't slow down. 13 months later_ my hair is still falling out (100-300 per day_ no lie) and I am looking into getting a wig. The hair loss is diffuse and depressing.

Irritable mood.,Side effects came on slowly.  First felt fine and thought this may be the one.  However strange things started happening to me.  My neck started itching like crazy but I was traveling and figured it was an allergic reaction.  However my itchy skin continued for months and eventually headed down my arms where I broke out in small red legions.  My hair line was very itchy too.  It didn't occur to me Yaz was causing this because the itchying was off and on.  It started getting worse and worse after a few months and after taking 1 pill both arms broke out in red bumps and my face turned extremely red and was very itchy_ almost like taking niacin.  That is when I realized something was wrong and Yaz must be causing this.    I also noticed I was very irritable all the time and couldn't stand talking to people. I wanted to bite their heads off.

My skin was clear and my periods were light. However_ I had sinus headaches so bad that I would miss work and school at least once a week. I kept visiting the doctor for sinus infections and they never mentioned it could be the pill until finally I stopped it and a month later those headaches stopped_ I mentioned to the doctor and she was surprised but did not deny the possibility. I also got such bad anxiety I thought I was going absolutely insane_ I did not want to go out and I had crying spells (which I never had before that ever) My family did not even know what to do anymore and I had never been in that kind of situation it was actually really scary.

34, 5, moderate acne,weight gain-then-loss-then-gain_ breast size increase_ moodiness_ alternating hunger and nausea,I went on about 2 1/2 months ago for the second time after about a year off it. The first time I took it_ I wasn't a responsible med-taker_ and always took it at different times when I even remembered to take it at all. Then it was to treat irregular periods. This time_ it's for the moderate acne that's been wreaking havoc on my skin lately. I was put on it in conjunction with doxycycline and retin-a micro_ but I began the Yaz about a month before the latter two. It's helped to dramatically clear my skin_ but with a couple pleasant and unpleasant side effects. My weight has been fluctuating from week to week_ due to an increase and then decrease in appetite. I've been having mood swings_ that range from absolute fury to mild irritation to deep sadness to mild contentment_ but I rarely ever am very happy any longer. I hope that will improve soon_ because it's doing such a bang-up job on my skin_ has been useful as a form of birth control_ and has increased my breast size. Unfortunately_ it now puts me smack dab between bra sizes_ which means I either wear a half-size too big_ which gaps_ or a half-size too small which gives such an unattractive muffin top effect. Still_ it's an entertaining improvement_ and my boyfriend is not unhappy (save about the mood swings). Overall_ worth it.,F,20,10  weeks 1X D,7/26/2011,Yaz

I experienced a UTI but luckily I caught it in the beginning. I lost my sex drive completely to the point where I didn't think about sex or even really kissing my husband!!!! and whenever I would try to have sex with him I was so dry that even lube wouldn't work for more than 5 minutes. I used to have different emotions and be expressive but I turned out that I was just ""going with the flow_ whatever"" type of mood all the time and didn't have any input on anything.

No thanks - I stopped taking it and won't go on it again.,F,28,2  months 1X D,5/31/2011,Yaz
41, 1, birth control,severe constipation_  irregular periods lasting 2 weeks_ breakthrough bleeding.,I was so constipated that I had a colonoscopy for fear I had a blockage.  I ate very healthy foods and exercised regularly.  Still no explanation for the constipation.  For about the last 6 months I was on Yaz_ I was bleeding over 50 percent of each month.  I finally went off of BCP about 5 months ago. Now I have regular_ light periods_ usually lasting 4-5 days.  I always thought BCP caused lighter regular periods.  That sure wsn't the case for me.,F,41,2  years 1X D,4/14/2011,Yaz
42, 5, PMDD_ Acne_ Dysmenorrhea,Nausea at some point during the day_ however it is starting to disappear. Also breast enlargement.,It's taken away almost all my PMDD symptoms completely. No bloating_ no insomnia_ very little mood swings_ no cramps_ little back pain_ no break outs.,F,18,30  days 1X D,4/11/2011,Yaz
43, 1, Birth control,Breast soreness_ weight gain_ extremely dry skin_ acne_ moodiness_ loss of sex drive_ vaginal dryness,I asked my GP for a contraceptive pill with less side effects. HA! This is the worst one I've ever been on. The skin on my face is peeling and at the same time I'm getting pimples_ and I have a dry_ itchy rash on my arms. My breasts are so sore that it hurts to put a bra on and take it off. I have no interest in sex whatsoever even though I normally have a high sex drive. After reading about many women's experiences with blood clotting_ I am going off this pill straight away. Poisonous stuff_ I can't believe they get away with selling it.,F,23,40  days 1X D,4/7/2011Email,Yaz

45, 3, to regulate period,I do have migraines constantly_ but I put and end to these easily when I begin to feel them coming on with two tablets of IBUPROFIN. Some nights i feel a little cloudy but not often. I do get more tired_ but in a way i sleep better because i get so tired. It has given me a few depressive/sad night but they ware off quickly by morning. I must say  since I have started using yaz my mood has lifted. I feel the need to be more energetic and I have many more happy moments than in the past_ I just tend to wake up feeling like 10x happier than usual. One side effect I do not like though is I have increased appetite!=( BUT there is hope i found  way to balance out my appetite with eating salmon and tuna and egg_ they seem to fill me up fast and i lose that false hungry feeling. Oh one more thing! I started feeling better with yaz when i began taking the pill right before i fell asleep instead of in mornings!,,F,18,60  days 1X D,2/26/2011,Yaz
46, 1, endometrial cyst treatment,severe bloating_ blood clots_ pressure in head_ blurry vision_ breast pain-tenderness and swelling_  depression_  severe emotional swings_  tiredness_ temporary loss of coordination/motor skills_  headaches_ severe discomfort due to overall swelling,Even if many are helped_ more have suffered. this drug operates on a hit and miss ratio. This is not morally right. People should not subject their precious lives at the risk of such consequences...nor risk the health of others on a hit or miss basis.  Doctors should get their facts straight before they prescribe. Before anything_ people must be well informed .  People perish for the lack of proper knowledge.,F,44,2  weeks 1X D,2/21/2011Email,Yaz
47, 1, To restart my periods,I honestly would not recommend this birth control medication to anyone. Like others_ I have experienced a 10 lb weight gain_ constant irritablity_ no sexual drive_ intense craving for carbs_ bloating_ and decreased energy levels. I have been off the medication for three days now and I am starting to get some of my energy back. Unfortunately_ two side effects I am experiencing right now are insomnia and hot flashes. Has anyone else had this similar experience?,,F,26,2  years 1X D,2/21/2011Email,Yaz
48, 2, Acne Reduction,Initially on Yasmin for 2 years and stopped owing to bad effects - extreme mood changes - in fact so extreme i could feel them coming on. My doctor prescribed YAZ and have been on that for almost 3 years. It has been a rough road - mood changes_ anxiety_ low motivation_ no libido whatsoever. My left breast grew twice the size of my right one - quite disturbing actually. I am sure it has had a part to play in the ending of my relationship and many friendships (even family was shocked at the behavioural changes in me). I am very fit - gym 3 times a week yet the weight did not come off while on these pills - it does a bit but stops after a while.,I would recommend people do not take it. I have stopped taking it last week so i am still to experience what is to come. I can see that a couple of blemishes have appeared on my face. The only positive thing YAZ (and Yasmin) did was clear up my face and allow me to know when my periods were coming. Unless you need it for that i would suggest stick to good old fashioned contraception. Not worth it.,F,27,3  years20MG 1X D,2/13/2011Email,Yaz
49, 3, birth control_ PMDD,weight loss_ terrible headaches,I really liked Yaz and would have continued if it wasn't for the headaches.  I have tried many birth control pills that made me feel bloated and depressed but this did not happen with Yaz.,F,32,6  months 1X D,2/8/2011,Yaz
50, 1, Birth control,Headaches_ decreased sex drive_ dry and itchy skin.,I felt awful on this pill and only lasted a week. It gave me very bad headaches and I had zero interest in sex. My skin became very dry and itched like crazy. I have switched to a different bc pill and feel back to normal. Yaz might work for some people_ but it just wasn't the right pill for me.,F,31,1  weeks 1X D,2/6/2011,Yaz
51, 4, Severe PPMD,I took Yaz for in May 2010. Until I started experiencing severe pains on my left side when I went to my Dr he said it was a mild stroke.,I stopped it immediately after. But it worked a great deal my PPMD was not as severe as before. Until some time in October 2010.,F,36,30  days 1X D,1/28/2011Email,Yaz
52, 1, pcos,Anxiety_ spotting_ lethargy_ mood swings_ acid reflux.,I figured out my anxiety attack were a direct result of the yaz because I missed a few days and the attacks went away. When I got my script refilled the anxiety attacks started back up so I quit taking them again just to be sure. I tried this 3 or 4 times to be 100% sure it was the Yaz.,F,30,3  months 1X D,1/5/2011,Yaz

54, 4, For my skin_ oil control,Mild headache and mind fog in the first month_ no side effects in the second or third month that I'm aware of.,I started taking Yaz to control the amount of oil on my face_ it works very well and my skin is very clear and has been since the start of treatment. My hair and face is no longer oily either. I did get headaches for the first month but now I have no side effects. I tried three other birth control pills before this one and every single one gave me migraines_ this is the only pill that doesn't.,F,23,3  months 1X D,12/19/2010,Yaz
55, 1, contraceptive,I had very frequent migraines while on Yaz- several a week and they lasted for about 24 hours each.,I went off of Yaz almost a year ago and have had terrible side effects. NEVER TAKE THIS DRUG. I had no period at all for almost 6 months_ and they are still very irregular. I also have pretty bad acne now- like nothing I have ever had before. I never even had an acne problem_ but now I get these painful pimples that are very unusual_ and I am certain that Yaz is to blame.,F,21,1  years 1X D,12/15/2010,Yaz
56, 1, contraceptive_ PCOS,I thought that the drug was a miracle. I did not have regular periods because of my PCOS and this pill regulated them. I did not have any weight gain and it was nice not to have to worry about getting pregnant.,After about 3 months_ I started to feel very tired and I was getting very severe headaches. Then i started having pain in my right lung. After about a week I went to the doctor and they found a blood clot in my brain and also one in my right lung. After doing all kinds of tests they told me that it wasn't genetic and it was simply cause by YAZ!! Now I am on blood thinners and my life sucks. I have to give blood everyday. DO NOT TAKE YAZ_ YOU MAY GET BLOOD CLOTS!,F,21,3  months1 1X D,12/1/2010,Yaz
