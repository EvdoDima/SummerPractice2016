0, 1, Birth control,,I decided to research the side effects on YAZ_ and instead i found a bunch of news articles about how there have been over 8_000 lawsuits from people getting blood clots and having strokes and all kinds of other health problems. 8_000 lawsuits!!! And those are the people who were lucky and lived_ there have been over 200 women who died after taking it. There has never been this many lawsuits against any other birth control. The progestin they use in YAZ is the newest kind not used in any other birth control_ and clearly its really dangerous. I would stay so far away from this pill its not even funny.,F,21,  1X D,10/9/2015Email,Yaz
1, 5, PMDD,None,YAZ was the first and only thing that worked against my severe PMDD symptoms. My life used to feel unlivable due to these symptoms so I am extremely grateful for YAZ_ and will be using it until I try for pregnancy (which will be a long time away).,F,20,2.5  years 1X D,7/8/2014,Yaz
2, 5, von Willebrands disease,Weight gain which killed my confidence. Sorted it out by working out 3times a week which makes me quite happy. Worked wonders for my periods and my blood clotting as I have an increased bleeding tendency. I used to pass out from the blood loss_ and now my periods are like everybody else's! Reduced nose bleeds_ and less bruising.,,F,24,1  years0_02/3MG,9/5/2013,Yaz
3, 1, birth control,Frequent leg cramps_ severely low libido_ vaginal dryness_ tender breasts_ PCOS_ Hypothyroidism_ Hormonal imbalance_ pituitary problems_ lactation_ chronic yeast infections_ painful intercourse.,Yaz ruined my life because it caused all the problems I have. I was only on it for three years and I had to stop. I gained 50 pounds and my body is a hormonal mess because it upped the testosterone production_ among other things. It made me hyperthyroid_ which no one has in my family. I had SEVERE LEG CRAMPS while on YAZ and felt so depressed. Then I started to get chronic yeast infections_ which to this day doctors can't explain and said it was all in my head when I mentioned that sex was severely painful. I felt like someone was literally stabbing the inside of my vagina,F,25,3  years 1X D,9/2/2013,Yaz

5, 1, birth control,Fainting_ Constantly Getting Sick_ Stomach Problems_ Losing my Hair_ Depression_ Anxiety_ Panic Attacks_ Heart Palpitations.... just to name a few.,I truly believe this pill almost killed me.  Took me 2 years to figure out it had slowly begun to cause ALL of my health problems.  This pill has already been linked to the death of 200 women in the US.  I would NEVER recommend this pill to any women.  Please don't put yourself through what I went through.  It is a very_ very dangerous drug.  Sadly_ I am still recovering almost 3 years later.,F,28,  1X D,12/19/2012,Yaz

For the first 2 years I didn't have too many side effects but for the past 3 years I can't say the same. I'm 23 and have no sex drive. That's not right at all. I'm ALWAYS tired and have extreme cramping which feels like knives stabbing into my stomach. My flow has increased so drastically_ that I have 2 change ""super"" tampon every 2 hours.

I discontinued 10 days later because of the hunger_ and I am STILL feeling the effects! It has now been three weeks since I have been off of it_ and the side effects are still here.

9, 1, baby stopper,No libido_ mood swings_ weight gain,I was taking Yasmin for about 5 years but decided to switch to Yaz so I would get shorter periods.  Worst. Idea. Ever.

10, 1, prevent pregnancy,severe mood swings_ slight weight gain,The slight weight gain doesn't bother me. You're going to get that with any birth control. But this pill made me crazy. I'm not a very emotional person and it made me want to cry all the time_ yell at someone_ etc. It got to the point that I couldn't take it anymore and just threw them away. I'd rather be on nothing at all then be on yaz.,F,23,7  months 1X D,7/25/2012,Yaz

My sex drive was been greatly reduced while being on this pill_ although I never associated that with Yaz until reading these reviews. My period was never regular on Yaz either. Then in May 2012 my gyno took me off of Yaz (she is taking all her patients off_ if that tells you anything.) I have since had severe withdrawal symptoms starting with persistent shortness of breath_ despite my o2 levels being 100%. I also have severe anxiety and have had to go on anti-depressants. I am very emotional. My body is so fatigued. My body would shake and I had pressure in my chest. I developed acid reflux_ which I had never had before. I experienced a strange numb/cold sensation in my ears/chest/back of neck. I have been to the ER 2x_ a cardiologist_ a family Dr_ a homeopathic Dr_ had a EKG_ stress test_ echo_ blood work_ and CT. All of which came back fine. I used to be athletic and love running- now I do good to make it around the block. After almost a month all symptoms have went away_ except for bizarre chest discomfort & the persistent shortness of breath. DO NOT TAKE YAZ- I would take acne anyday over this torture. After this_ I will never put another synthetic hormone in my body.,F,24,3  years 1X D,6/27/2012Email,Yaz
13, 2, Birth Control,STOMACH PROBLEMS: Diarrhea_ Nausea_ Vomiting; Decreased Sex Drive; Anxiety; Weight Loss; Resolved Acne Problems,The first month 2 months I was on Yaz I loved it_ these last 2 months_ however_ have been a nightmare. My doctors and I have been scratching our heads wondering why I've had consistent diarrhea for almost a month now (which has lead to 12 pounds lost in about 2 weeks time_ and it's been a struggle to keep my weight where it is now). Suddenly_ it struck me the other day_ I only started having all the side effects (stomach problems_ anxiety_ etc.) since I changed my birth control. I read up on the association of Yaz! and stomach problems and apparently it's relatively common. I've stopped taking Yaz!_ hopefully that means these problems will stop within the next several days.

I was on it for a year and a half and my first few months were okay too.. that's when it all started... I was constantly getting allergies_ having diarrhea_ stomach pain_ headaches_ hives_ excessive thirst_ and anxiety.  Then_ I thought I was just developing depression_ as I became sad all of the time.  I had so many problems sexually_ which I never had before_ including vaginal dryness and an inability to orgasm.  Finally_ I became more and more exhausted - first_ I couldn't go to the gym_ then_ anything other than going to work and straight back home was hard.  My muscles were in constant pain on this pill.,F,24,  1X D,4/19/2012,Yaz

At that point_ I had to quit my job because I was so sick.  I spent over $10_000 in medical tests that year.  It was a nightmare.  I thought I might be dying.  I came off_ only to find that I started feeling better again.  This pill was absolutely horrifying for me.  It put me through the worst physical_ mental_ and financial pain of my life.,F,26,2  years 1X D,4/4/2012,Yaz
17, 1, Periods,Passing out every 2 hours!,I have used contraceptives for years and was taken off of Ortho Evra due to the blood clot warning and put on Yaz.  Everything seemed fine the first week then this horrible side effect appeared! I am completely healthy and don't smoke etc and was experiencing episodes of dizziness to completely losing consiousness and even landed in the hospital!  I googled Yaz side effects as I had not changed anything in my lifestyle and it came up with causing blood sugar levels to drop. (That's what it says I swear!! But it was more than a simple drop!!!)  I had to drink Coke every time I started to feel sluggish or I would pass out-after discontinuing it took 10 days for the symptoms to fully disappear and I am fine now.

I finally put the pieces together after having doctors deny that it could be causing any of these problems.  I was completely healthy before this pill and became VERY ILL with numerous problems while taking it.  My personality and mood changed dramatically and I became very depressed and unlike myself.  Once coming off many of the symptoms went away_ but I have been off for 2 years now and I am still not 100% back to myself.  I am getting there slowly though.

First 2-3months were ROUGH!. experienced mood swings_ depression and a huge drop in libido. I decided to stick it out through those symptoms because I thought my body just needed to get used to medication. Should have quit from the beginning but I suffered from mood swings and low libido even before Yaz so wasnt certain if it was the pills or just me. Mood swings and depression got better after about 3 months. Increased appetite and low libido remained. Didn't gain weight on this pill_ but i work out and weight lift regularly. Months 3-6 started getting migraines during the inactive pill week_ headaches disappeared 1-2 days after I start a new pack of pills. Doctor thinks I have estrogen-withdrawal headaches from Yaz. switched me to Mircette which I will start tomorrow.

24, 1, Contraception,Anxiety_ Depression_ OCD,I posted back on 9/15/10. I stopped Yaz on 9/18/10. When I got off_ I noticed is that my depression peaked and I lost a ton of hair. I switched to Levora the week after and stayed on that until the end of February 2011. My anxiety and depression lessened_ but not enough_ so I switched to Zovia. I stayed on that from the beginning of March to the first week of April. I was still having panic attacks and was emotionally numb (even though it was a lot less severe than when I was on Yaz)_ so I stopped taking the pill altogether on 4/7/11. I'm almost 8 months off hormonal birth contrrol and I have to say that getting off was the greatest decision that I've ever made. The first few months were tough as my body went into withdrawal and my hormones were out of whack - I lost a lot of hair_ I had breakouts_ and I still had some depression and panic issues. As time went on though_ things got better. My depression is now completely gone and I had my last panic attack in August - took my last Xanex then and haven't needed it since. I also see a naturopathic doctor who figured out that the pill had depleted some vitamins and that I had a hormonal imbalance as well. I'm on an all natural regiment to rebalance my system. I still suffer from mild anxiety_ but I'm hoping that with time_ I can ease out of it as it's gotten significantly better.If you have problems on Yaz_ contact your doctor and stop taking it - don't wait!

25, 3, hormonal contraception_ PMDD_ acne,PMS worse (in terms of being weepy and easily upset); amenorrhea after 1.5 years use; leg cramps; slightly worsened depression and anxiety; extremely light period (when I get it); breakthrough bleeding occurs for me if I am lazy in dose scheduling (and say take a pill 3-4 hours later than yesterday_ repeat for 2 days = breakthrough bleeding).  So you need to be very consistent with dosing at the same time (within 2 hours of previous dose) to prevent breakthrough bleeding.  It sucks having 2 mini periods/month.,Read that it caused migraines_ but I had them way before Yaz_ and I didn't take it continuously through 2010_ and stopping the drug didn't decrease migraines.I like Yaz because I do not get the water retention evident from other pills I've tried (Ortho-Tri-Cyclen Lo_ Alesse_ Yasmine).  Of all of those pills_ Yasmine drove me the most crazy - mood swings_ irritability_ extreme anxiety_ constant panic attacks_ depression_ crying (all sudden onset and all during the 12 days I took Yasmine).  Yaz has been the best_ as I hate weight gainer drugs_ and it seems to keep water weight off well in me (perhaps the increased potassium levels? dunno).

26, 3, Avoid pregnancy,I got on it at age 14. Super young but I was sexually active & didn't want to risk getting pregnant. YAZ was great! No weight gain. No mood changes. No hair loss. No anything!!! I am now 19 & gained a few pounds. I'm 5'8 & 138 pounds. I'd like to be 10 pounds lighter. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LOSE WEIGHT. My calorie intake is 700 & I exercise. The YAZ doesn't allow my body to lose weight & worst of all I recently got severe cellulite. I feel that being on a birth control for so long has changed my body. I never had cellulite & now it's all over my butt & thighs. I am getting off in a week to see how things go. I would recommend it but only for a short period of time. Do not exceed a few years like I did.,,F,19,5  years 1X D,10/14/2011Email,Yaz
27, 1, PMDD,Severe depression_ suicidal thoughts_ increase in PMDD,I was prescribed YAZ last year due to the fact that I suffer severe PMDD and no SSRI's seem to have worked for me. When I first started taking it I thought I had found the miracle drug. I had light periods_ no cramping_ and best of all.. no pmdd or pms symptoms at all. I loved it. After about two to three months things slowly began to change. I noticed I was severly depressed ALL THE TIME. About absolutely nothing. I was like a walking empty shell. I couldn't feel happiness_ sadness_ joy_ fear_ excitement_ NOTHING. I was a zombie. On top of that I was extremely tired all the time_ and all I wanted to do was sleep. When I did sleep I had strange dreams that woke me in cold sweats. Finally_ I called my doctor and I told him what I was feeling and he told me to discontinue the YAZ right away_ which I did. It took approx. 3 weeks for my body to become back to normal after stopping the YAZ. When it did become back to normal I noticed the PMDD seemed to have disappeared as well. Months went by and I was a normal female with normal PMS symptoms. Then PMDD came creeping back slowly_ and hit me like a brick wall. Its by far worse than I ever knew it could be. It intensified greatly_ and to this day I am battling major depression and suicidal thoughts every month_ and I have yet to find something that can help. YAZ ruined my life_ and I dont suggest it to anyone!!!!!!!,F,27,4  months 1X D,10/7/2011Email,Yaz
28, 5, birth control,lighter periods_ increased breast size_ controls PMS symptoms_ slight decrease in sex drive.,I have been on Yaz for a little over a month and I LOVE it.  It's easily the best birth control pill I have taken.  I have been other pills over the years and they all have made me extremely irratable with major mood swings.  This pill seems to help control my moods.  I was actually taking welbutrin before to help with mild depression and mood swings and have since stopped since taking Yaz.  I have not gained any weight and my breast seem to have increased in size a bit.  The only negative side effect I can report is a slight decrease in my sex drive.  I would highly recommend this pill for any women who have struggled with mood swings and weight gain while on other birth control pills.,F,31,35  days3MG/0.02MG 1X D,9/26/2011,Yaz
29, 1, Heavy Painful Periods,Massive HAIR LOSS_ 2 Breast Lumps_ Gall Bladder Issues_  Psychotic Mood Swings_ Cleared up acne_ Short light periods_ Increased cup size_ Decreased libido,The first few months I was extremely irritable_ violently angry_ and depressed.  After awhile I got used to it and felt fine_ maybe even a little bit too emotionless with no libido. My acne prone skin became flawless and my periods short_ light with minimal cramping.  After the first year I did develop what the doctors think is endometriosis_ intense debilitating abdominal pain along with gas.  Not sure if this is related or not since doctors usually prescribe BC to treat endo...  After 3 years I developed breast pain and 2 lumps which had to be biopsied and I still have the ugly scars 1.5years later.  I started having an intolerance to fatty foods_ which indicates a gall bladder issue.  I could not eat icecream anymore without getting really ill.  I started noticing hair loss.  I don't know if it was gradual or all of a sudden_ but I do know I loss over half my hair. It's been a year and a half after I've stopped taking yaz and it still has not gotten better.  I am so depressed about this.  It took a year+ for my hormones to go back to normal.  My face is breaking out bad again and I'm having heavier and heavier periods.  I also have a slight melasma on/along my upper lip. The doctors don't tell you about the negative effects of these pills even though some are very common and even permanent.

I became incredibly ill while taking this pill and doctors could not figure out why.  I was constantly getting sick while on Yaz_ although I had been healthy before.  I was always tired_ had severe stomach problems_ anxiety attacks_ and depression.  I could barely work out and if I did my muscles would hurt.  It took me a YEAR to recover from the horrible side-effects of this pill once I came off.  I did however_ notice vast improvements within 2 DAYS of stopping the pill!  DO NOT TAKE!

While I was on yaz (not after I stopped taking it) my hair started POURING off of my head. I stopped when it didn't slow down. 13 months later_ my hair is still falling out (100-300 per day_ no lie) and I am looking into getting a wig. The hair loss is diffuse and depressing.

Irritable mood.,Side effects came on slowly.  First felt fine and thought this may be the one.  However strange things started happening to me.  My neck started itching like crazy but I was traveling and figured it was an allergic reaction.  However my itchy skin continued for months and eventually headed down my arms where I broke out in small red legions.  My hair line was very itchy too.  It didn't occur to me Yaz was causing this because the itchying was off and on.  It started getting worse and worse after a few months and after taking 1 pill both arms broke out in red bumps and my face turned extremely red and was very itchy_ almost like taking niacin.  That is when I realized something was wrong and Yaz must be causing this.    I also noticed I was very irritable all the time and couldn't stand talking to people. I wanted to bite their heads off.

My skin was clear and my periods were light. However_ I had sinus headaches so bad that I would miss work and school at least once a week. I kept visiting the doctor for sinus infections and they never mentioned it could be the pill until finally I stopped it and a month later those headaches stopped_ I mentioned to the doctor and she was surprised but did not deny the possibility. I also got such bad anxiety I thought I was going absolutely insane_ I did not want to go out and I had crying spells (which I never had before that ever) My family did not even know what to do anymore and I had never been in that kind of situation it was actually really scary.

34, 5, moderate acne,weight gain-then-loss-then-gain_ breast size increase_ moodiness_ alternating hunger and nausea,I went on about 2 1/2 months ago for the second time after about a year off it. The first time I took it_ I wasn't a responsible med-taker_ and always took it at different times when I even remembered to take it at all. Then it was to treat irregular periods. This time_ it's for the moderate acne that's been wreaking havoc on my skin lately. I was put on it in conjunction with doxycycline and retin-a micro_ but I began the Yaz about a month before the latter two. It's helped to dramatically clear my skin_ but with a couple pleasant and unpleasant side effects. My weight has been fluctuating from week to week_ due to an increase and then decrease in appetite. I've been having mood swings_ that range from absolute fury to mild irritation to deep sadness to mild contentment_ but I rarely ever am very happy any longer. I hope that will improve soon_ because it's doing such a bang-up job on my skin_ has been useful as a form of birth control_ and has increased my breast size. Unfortunately_ it now puts me smack dab between bra sizes_ which means I either wear a half-size too big_ which gaps_ or a half-size too small which gives such an unattractive muffin top effect. Still_ it's an entertaining improvement_ and my boyfriend is not unhappy (save about the mood swings). Overall_ worth it.,F,20,10  weeks 1X D,7/26/2011,Yaz

I experienced a UTI but luckily I caught it in the beginning. I lost my sex drive completely to the point where I didn't think about sex or even really kissing my husband!!!! and whenever I would try to have sex with him I was so dry that even lube wouldn't work for more than 5 minutes. I used to have different emotions and be expressive but I turned out that I was just ""going with the flow_ whatever"" type of mood all the time and didn't have any input on anything.

41, 1, birth control,severe constipation_  irregular periods lasting 2 weeks_ breakthrough bleeding.,I was so constipated that I had a colonoscopy for fear I had a blockage.  I ate very healthy foods and exercised regularly.  Still no explanation for the constipation.  For about the last 6 months I was on Yaz_ I was bleeding over 50 percent of each month.  I finally went off of BCP about 5 months ago. Now I have regular_ light periods_ usually lasting 4-5 days.  I always thought BCP caused lighter regular periods.

This is the worst one I've ever been on. The skin on my face is peeling and at the same time I'm getting pimples_ and I have a dry_ itchy rash on my arms. My breasts are so sore that it hurts to put a bra on and take it off. I have no interest in sex whatsoever even though I normally have a high sex drive. After reading about many women's experiences with blood clotting_ I am going off this pill straight away.

45, 3, to regulate period,I do have migraines constantly_ but I put and end to these easily when I begin to feel them coming on with two tablets of IBUPROFIN. Some nights i feel a little cloudy but not often. I do get more tired_ but in a way i sleep better because i get so tired. It has given me a few depressive/sad night but they ware off quickly by morning. I must say  since I have started using yaz my mood has lifted. I feel the need to be more energetic and I have many more happy moments than in the past_ I just tend to wake up feeling like 10x happier than usual. One side effect I do not like though is I have increased appetite!=( BUT there is hope i found  way to balance out my appetite with eating salmon and tuna and egg_ they seem to fill me up fast and i lose that false hungry feeling. Oh one more thing! I started feeling better with yaz when i began taking the pill right before i fell asleep instead of in mornings!,,F,18,60  days 1X D,2/26/2011,Yaz

This is not morally right. People should not subject their precious lives at the risk of such consequences...nor risk the health of others on a hit or miss basis.

47, 1, To restart my periods,I honestly would not recommend this birth control medication to anyone. Like others_ I have experienced a 10 lb weight gain_ constant irritablity_ no sexual drive_ intense craving for carbs_ bloating_ and decreased energy levels. I have been off the medication for three days now and I am starting to get some of my energy back. Unfortunately_ two side effects I am experiencing right now are insomnia and hot flashes.

48, 2, Acne Reduction,Initially on Yasmin for 2 years and stopped owing to bad effects - extreme mood changes - in fact so extreme i could feel them coming on. My doctor prescribed YAZ and have been on that for almost 3 years. It has been a rough road - mood changes_ anxiety_ low motivation_ no libido whatsoever. My left breast grew twice the size of my right one - quite disturbing actually. I am sure it has had a part to play in the ending of my relationship and many friendships (even family was shocked at the behavioural changes in me). I am very fit - gym 3 times a week yet the weight did not come off while on these pills - it does a bit but stops after a while.,I would recommend people do not take it. I have stopped taking it last week so i am still to experience what is to come. I can see that a couple of blemishes have appeared on my face. The only positive thing YAZ (and Yasmin) did was clear up my face and allow me to know when my periods were coming. Unless you need it for that i would suggest stick to good old fashioned contraception. Not worth it.,F,27,3  years20MG 1X D,2/13/2011Email,Yaz

Then i started having pain in my right lung. After about a week I went to the doctor and they found a blood clot in my brain and also one in my right lung.

63, 1, Birth Control,Anxiety_ Depression,"I've been on Yaz for approximately two and a half years. For two years_ I was fine (Fit_ non-smoker). However_ about six months ago_ I noticed myself starting to get anxious_ especially right before I was supposed to have my period. As time progressed up until this point_ I've had panic attacks. I've also been hypersensitive_ depressed_ had a loss of appetite and have recently been constipated. Since July_ I've been seeing a psychologist regularly and my physician gave me Xanex (0.25 MG) just to ""take the edge off"" (considering it's a very small dosage) if I needed it. In any case_ I've been researching the link between Yaz and anxiety and I'm convinced that this is the Yaz in my system. I took my last pink pill yesterday (before I knew about the Yaz/Anxiety link) and I will not be taking the placebos to finish out the cycle. I am going to my gynocologist this weekend to get bloodwork done to check my hormone levels and to request changing my birth control prescription.

64, 3, PMDD,Weight gain_ poor circulation_ bloood clotting_ blurry vision_ loss of feeling in limbs at times_ low sex drive to almost none_ vaginal dryness_ no sense of feeling (neither happy nor sad)_ constipation,I was taking Yaz for PMDD. PMDD was RUINING my life. My fiance thinks Yaz is the wonder pill for fixing PMDD. However_ the first 6 months I had very clumpy spotting when I wasn't on my period. That lasted for most of the 7th month. I went to the ER because the clots were so weird. Luckily the doctors found nothing severe. I kept taking YAZ because it made me feel so good and it made my acne-prone skin so beautiful. After taking it for over a year_ I decided to go off of YAZ this week because I decided I put on enough weight that I couldn't take it anymore. I am not moody_ however I don't feel much at all. I'm neither happy nor sad and I should be a very happy person! Great job_ newly engaged and building m dream home but yet_ nothing. I'm not sad_ either_ when sad things happen to me. I am also terrified of the possibility of blood clots_ stroke_ etc. I'll take PMDD and bad acne over being a bloated girl with no feelings. I can cover up the acne with make up and hopefully find another birth control to regulate my prior heavy cycle. Ever since taking yaz my legs go numb whenever I sit. I fell down the other day after getting up from sitting in my desk chair for a long time. My vision is blurry. I have gained 20 pounds this year and I watch what I eat and am very active. Sex is disgusting to me now. I have no drive what-so-ever. I am done with yaz!!!!,,25,1.5  years 1X D,9/13/2010,Yaz

67, 3, PMDD,Very sore breasts and my sexual libido dropped significantly. I remember the libido problem back with another BC pill so this may just be the effect BC pills have on me. I have never had my breasts swell and ache this much though. That's good and not so good.Period was much lighter and moodwise I was FAR more stable.,"Apparently I truly did have PMDD as this drug has improved my mood tremendously whereas before I was suffering for about a week to two weeks with severe mood swings. The worst of my mood swimgs would happen the day before my period. It got so bad that twice I was hospitalized for what was deemed a ""mixed"" episode of depression combined with extreme irritability. The day my period started those symptoms would go away. It's only been two months but I'm relieved that the rage and depression have eased to a managable level. It's still early but that's my experience thus far.I should add though that this pill has made my sexual drive drop dramatically and it's hard to reach. That's not so fun.P.S. I'm a former light smoker (age 27-31) and I quit not only for my health in the long-term but also because I desperately wanted to see if this pill would help with my PMDD as it said it would.

I'd throw up green foamy stuff (bial) and then i'd feel great. So i thought it was just a bug_ but then it never ended. So school began and I still took it at the same time everyday and the throwing up didn't end. So I went to urgent care before the first day of school.

71, 2, PCOS/Birth control,Nausea_ Headaches_ Hives_ Raging Mood Swings,The nausea and headaches were bearable.  I ended up coming off of Yaz because of the hives and mood swings.  Hives are not a normal reaction.  I had a severe allergic reaction to Alesse birth control pill when I was 16 and it just so happens that the estrogen in Yaz and Alesse are the same_ apparently I'm allergic to synthetic estrogen.  At any rate what was absolutely unbearable were the mood swings.  My gynecologist explained to me that it is trial and error with birth control pills as far as side effects go and every body is different.  In my case I'm a stay at home mom with an eight month old and the mood swings got to the point where I didn't feel like I could control my anger.  I didn't want to get to the point where I was losing my cool with my baby and I feel it would have gotten to that point if I had continued with Yaz.,F,20,15  daysReg 1X D,8/31/2010,Yaz
72, 1, Contraceptive and period regulation,I was timid about using birth control at all because of the horror stories and when my doctor prescribed Yaz i asked if I could have a different prescription_ but he assured me that Yaz was not any more dangerous than other birth controls.  After 2 months of being on the pill I had consistent horrible headaches almost daily. I had been extremely emotional and had lost a lot of motivation and also felt tired and weak.  I didn't put these symptoms together until my leg went entirely numb one day and I started shaking.  I stopped taking Yaz immediately and haven't started another birth control since.  I only stopped almost 3 months ago_ after about a month I felt entirely normal_ but another month after that I started feeling extremely stressed and extremely emotional without reason.

I switched to Low-Ogestrel and within 5 months had acquired an insatiable appetite and gained 20 pounds. I intend to meet with my physician today and I will be discontinuing Low-Ogestral.

During that six month period_ Yaz worked wonders_ but time came to come off Accutane and I wanted to continue on Yaz. The second time around wasn't so wonderful. I ceased getting my period at all and I gained upwards of 20 pounds. No matter how much exercise and cardio (at one point I was doing upwards of 3 hours of cardio and weights with NO results) nothing could help me shed my weight.,After reading the comments on here_ I plan on stopping Yaz altogether.

My moodiness did go down prior to my period. I had no desire for sex ever and when I did I experienced vaginal dryness and painful intercourse. Gained about 40 lbs in first 9 months with no real change in lifestyle/ eating habits.  Since I stopped the pill I have been seeing weight shed off and my sex drive go through the roof. Heard far too many horror stories to recommend it to anyone. I'm afraid that I did irreversable damage to my body in the 3 years I was on it.,F,22,3  years 1X D,6/17/2010,Yaz
78, 4, Acne + Birth Control,Skin became somewhat clearer,I have been taking Yaz for 2 years now and just stopped taking it a month ago because my mother was concered about side effects I might have in the future due to so many complaints shown on TV and websites. I did not want to get off the Pill because it prevents pregancy while keeping my acne under control. I experienced no negative effects while taking Yaz and I wish I could take it again but maybe it is healthier to not be taking any pills. Although_ I don't want to be preggers anytime soon and all the other birth control options are getting bad reviews too so I guess it depends on the person.,F,19,2  years 1X D,6/16/2010,Yaz

Sex = long period.)_ LOW sex drive  :(,I started on the pill for acne reasons and because I had just become sexually active. I guess it initially helped with acne flare ups around my period_ but if it did_ it didn't help for long. I rarely have a completely clear face_ and I always have 2-3 acne spots on my face (which are imposible to cover up) around my period. Plus my boobs always hurt during my period and I still get wicked cramps.Before I started the Pill_ I was always really pissy before my period_ but fine durring it. The Pill made it so I was fine all the time for a while (about a year). Lately I have noticed that I am the bitch from hell before and during my period. I get pissed off for no reason and get really depressed. All I want to do is sleep and I hate everything and everyone. Seeing as this is what Yaz is supposed to prevent_ I think there's something wrong here and time to change birth control pills. Especially since I was never very bitchy before I started taking the pill.My periods before I went on the pill were 7 days long and miserible. After 9 months of being on the pill_ they went down to 4 days!!! Plus it was really light so I could get away with using light and a few regular tampons (money saver!). Now I am starting to think that there was another reason it took 9 months for my period to go down to 4 days. I have noticed lately that when I am sexually active the week before my period_ that my period lasts 7+ days_ and if I'm not sexually active_ then it lasts 4-5 days.

80, 1, Pregnancy prevention & Acne,Heart palpitations_ weight gain_ mood swings_ headaches_ nausea_ breast tenderness,I do not smoke or drink and am not overweight.  I eat fairly healthy_ am active_ and take a multivitamin and calcium supplement daily_ so I consider myself a healthy person.  I have been experiencing heart palpitations like crazy since starting this medication.  I also suffer from extreme mood swings now with lingering depression and thoughts of suicide which I never felt before beginning this contraceptive.  I've gained 25 pounds over the course of a year and have had headaches more often as time has passed taking Yaz.  After reading the warnings which the FDA has issued Bayer on this drug (not only for blood clots and heart issues for people who are not even at risk!!!_ but violations pertaining to the advertising they've used to market this)_ I've decided to stop taking this poison and find an alternate form of birth control.  I also have moderate acne which did not change much on the medication either.  I have taken Ortho Novum and Ortho Tri-Cyclen regular and Lo versions in the past and have experienced some symptoms such as weight gain and breast tenderness_ but never did have symptoms like this and to such extremes.  Beware of Yaz and don't let the commercials with clear-faced vibrant looking young women fool you.  It is fact_ that there are indeed thousands of lawsuits filed against Bayer_ which distributes Yaz and Yasmin_ so please do some research first before you decide to take either one of these.,F,26,12  months 1X D,6/13/2010,Yaz
81, 5, PCOS_ amenorrhea_ skin_ energy_ etc,This tablet is the best that I have tried so far_ of any BC pill or progesterone therapy for my PCOS.   Progesterone and its synthetic forms is VERY BAD FOR ME so I was surprised how easily I tolerated and actually liked taking the drospirenone_ instead. Not surprising since it is a very different compound.,This is the first tablet I have tried which has actually relieved my constnat sense of thirst and dry mouth_ which also comes together with urinary retention/water retention and weight gain from fluids. I am super happy about this bkz normally I have this all the time regardless whether or what I take. This prevents the major fatigue I usually have_ but not to any impressive extent_. I am functional_ but not my best still. But thats an improvement! I have supple_ elastic skin which I have not had in years. I feel some pains in my ovaries when taking this_ but its due to my condition and not the pill_ I say. I havent taken it long enough to know if it brings a cycle_ nor long enough to maybe see the full results. IE I havent lost any weight with this yet_ which I really want to bkz I am 30 lbs heavier than I used to be. But I am really happy with this_ byfar_ for it brings me relief that no other pill has and no side effects! Best for women with high androgen caused PCOS_ and not a bc of choice for 'normal' women or PCOS caused by insulin disturbances. As for libido_ I have always had nearly none physically (tho mentally yes) so Yaz hasnt changed anythign for me LOL Beyond that.... I am very glad I found this_ I feel alot better with it than without_ although I still have quite a lot of progress until Im as good as I once was (before pcos).

It's one of the newest on the market_ and supposed to treat PMS and PMDD_ but it totally did the complete opposite for me.-After 3:00 (when I took my pill) it was like Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde. I'd go crazy_ be crying non stop for stupid reasons_ and get angry at the drop of a hat.- I experienced 4 WEEKS of breakthrough bleeding. Yaz is only supposed to give you 4 days of your period_ but apparently I got 4 weeks.- My acne actually got WORSE. I didn't have much to begin with_ but my face broke out so easily while on Yaz.Do NOT take Yaz! Bad idea.,F,20,3  months 1X D,5/31/2010,Yaz
83, 1, regulate periods_ prevent pregnancy,I'm so glad I found this site- I've been on YAZ for about a year now after getting off of Ortho-Tricyclen LO because I thought it was making me crazy. Since I've been on YAZ_ my periods have stopped altogether_ but I've gained weight and I have NO sex drive.,But the worst of it_ by far_ is the way it makes me emotionally. I am upset all the time- I can't handle any stress what so ever and I am not usually like that. The ONLY change in my life has been YAZ. I just can't believe it took so long for me to see this.,F,29,1  years 1X D,5/23/2010Email,Yaz

86, 1, Acne_ P.C.O.S.,I've been on this for three weeks and am ready to quit! Since I have started it I have gotten WORSE acne_ moodiness_ crying fits_ angry outbursts_ insomnia_ thickness of vaginal secretions (it's like yogurt rather than egg whites)_ increased appetite by a hundred fold_ number of migraines have increased_ shortness of breath_ burning eyes_ dry eyes_ and woke up this morning with severe cramp in calf. I just took two Aspirin tablets after reading the reviews on here. Also had lower back pain like I had been punched in the kidneys and the faint feeling of a U.T.I. starting. Nausea_ panic attacks... on and on!,This pill is terrible. There's no way I would recommend anyone taking this pill as the side effects just aren't worth it. There are better ways to control acne_ other pills_ topical gels_ etc. that I wouln't have to fear dying over. I really dislike the feeling of having to worry that every migraine I get is a brain hemorrhage and that this current cramp is my calf is a blood clot. Too scary!,F,29,3  weeks 1X D,4/30/2010,Yaz
87, 1, acne/ birth control,cleared acne_ light periods_ weight gain of 15lbs despite diet/exercise_ celulite_ depression_ moodiness_ tired all the time_ crying for no reason_ no sex drive_ weird vaginal oder and dryness_ and the list goes on.....,I was on yaz for about a year and at fist it was fine. My acne cleared up and i had light periods. But after a few months i started noticing celulite (which i have never had before) and weight gain. no matter how much i dieted and exercised the celulite or weight wouldnt go away. it was very frustrating but it cleared up my acne so i decided to stay on it longer. at about month 8 i started noticing how tired i was all the time and i would sleep whenever i would get the chance to. I also started got very depressed and wouldnt want to have any interaction with anyone. It changed me into a totally different person. I went from being really outgoing and talkitive to being a quiet isolated person. I finally figured that enough was enough and i missed my old self so i went off of it. I have been off for a few months now and my weight is coming off and my celulite has gone away and all i had to do was get off the pill. i didnt need to diet or anything. My acne never came back and my face is clear. My mood is also back to normal and i am my self again and it feels great! I would not suggest taking Yaz or any other bcp.. It may be convinient but its horrible for you and its definitely not worth it since there are many other alternatives.,F,18,1  years 1X D,4/28/2010,Yaz
88, 1, prevent pregnancy,when i started taking yaz i started getting headaches_ i felt hungry ALL the time i gained 5lbs the first month on it_ i had mood swings all the time felt like crying for no reason at all. Sometimes i would get a pain in my lower abdomen.. i hated this pill but it did clear up my skin even tho it wasnt that bad to begin with.,i would not recommend it i was miserable the whole time i was on it!,F,19,2  months 1X D,4/27/2010,Yaz
89, 3, Birth Control,cleared acne_ superficial blood clot,I really loved taking Yaz for some time.  It helped clear my acne and I felt emotionally stable taking it.  However_ about two months ago I was hospitalized for a superficial blood clot and was taken off it it (as it could have been the cause).  Do not think that just because you are not high risk that you aren't susceptible to the warnings.  I am not a smoker and still got the blood clot.  Be careful!  Also_ if you get a blood clot do not let your doctor switch you to Micronor for birth control as it is the devil.  Look it up on this website for more information...,F,26,4  years 1X D,4/24/2010,Yaz
90, 1, more predictable periods_ acne_ pms,my 17 year old  had a blood clot (DVT) and lung clot (pulmonary embolism) just weeks after starting Yaz.,It started with pain in back of the thigh when going up stairs. Went to the doc twice. Nobody realized it was a DVT. Then excruciating chest pain when part of the clot moved to her lung. Still_ the doctors didn't figure it out until her leg swelled up and turned blue when the clot got large enough to completely cut off all blood flow. My daughter was skinny_ non-smoker_ in good shape and only 17. She was lucky to survive. Lung clots are about 30% fatal. 5% of American woman carry a super clotting gene that doesn't mix with birth control pills and it is starting to look like Yaz might be worse than other brands. Very few people with a super clotting gene are aware of it. Do you want to find out the hard way?,F,17,45  days 1X D,4/24/2010Email,Yaz
91, 1, endometriosis & PMDD,Weight gain_ major bloating_ constant water retention_ increase in breast pain/swelling_ insomnia.,Great stuff for the mood issues and acne (those were cleared up) but I've put on almost 10 lbs in the past year while on it_ and I bloat to where it looks like I'm 7 months pregnant.  Also_ water retention just never goes away while on this_ not even during your period.  Periods are heavier_ crampier_ and longer.  Now I'm cramping on and off all month long (but that's also due to endometriosis.)  I hate this drug and am going off it.

Many symptoms of adrenal fatigue. It lowers your aldosterone levels and lowers your blood pressure. BAD for hypothyroid. I woudln't recommend this drug to anyone much less a person with low thyroid levels. My gyno insisted the med had nothing to do with any of it. So ignorant.,F,34,90  days 1X D,4/15/2010Email,Yaz
93, 1, Birth Control,Painful sex; complete loss of sex drive,"It took me four years to find a doctor who could tell me why sex was so painful--two gyns simply said ""it happens."" Finally_ I found a doc who did blood tests and told me that my birth control pills had caused hormone levels to drop to frighteningly low levels_ leading to a complete lack of sex drive_ as well as changes to the vaginal tissues and nerves that made sex all but impossible. This was not ""vaginal dryness"" although other gyns thought so. It is not just Yaz_ but all low-dose or ""lighter"" bc pills have the potential to cause these side-effects. These side effects are underreported because the average gyn doesn't know about them_ and/or they don't take female sexual complaints seriously. If you have symptoms such as this_ don't take your doctor's word for it. It doesn't ""just happen"" and its not ""in your head."" Do some research and find a doc who can help.",F,43,4  years 1X D,4/14/2010,Yaz

But I saw that some women on here had problems with yeast infections...I got the first yeast infection (plus uti) of my life a couple months ago_ I believe it to be related to Yaz...I would NOT recommend taking it_ especially with all of the possible dangerous long-term side effects!!

Tried garlic_ yogurt_ OTC_ prescription meds_ no sex_ no sugars_ low carbs_ etc.  Eventually i stopped taking Yaz and although I got a few more in the next 4 months..its been a year with no Yeast infection and NO BC pills.,F,28,3  years 1X D,3/10/2010,Yaz
97, 5, Birth control,No side effects.,I love yaz. It cleared up my skin. I didn't gain any weight and I have never had break through bleeding. I am a little worried about all the lawsuits but I don't smoke_ drink_ take any medication and I am a dancer so I am in shape. So I am going to keep taking it because it works so well. I am watching my diet now and trying to eat low K foods just in case.

100, 3, birth control/acne,headaches_ dizziness_ faintness_ mood swings_ crying,I'm not sure if these side effects are due to Yaz; I've had vertigo for several years_ this medicine seems to increase it. I have never had headaches before_ but about 6 months ago they started in my temples: piercing and very painful headaches that last for 1-2 days. Many times I feel like I am going to pass out and grow very faint (this did not happen before Yaz)_ but my iron levels are low so that may have something to do with it. I am somewhat satisfied with Yaz--never had any spotting. Placebos start on Thursday; I've been getting my period later and later. Now it starts on Saturday afternoon and probably won't stop until Thursday. Yaz hasn't done anything to clear up my acne. I breakout very badly before my period and sometimes it takes a month to clear.,F,22,1  years 1X D,2/15/2010Email,Yaz

However_ in recent times Ive been having some pretty heavy weight gain_ my breast grew 2 sizes and I have been having heavy breakthroughs and abnormally long periods. I thought it was something I was doing wrong and not the pill but as a college athlete with a strict diet plan I can't see where I went wrong.

My breasts were so tender before my period I slept in a sports bra_ My face broke out in pimples & I have never had skin problems a day in my life. I was more agitated and anxious before my period_ as well.

I have been on & off of SEVERAL b.c. things for the past 12 years_ & Yaz has beat them all by FAR!  It has MAJOR helped my skin_ & I have no lightheadedness_ or dizziness like I was experiencing on other pills.  Also_ my periods are lighter_ & I have no cramps at all.

105, 4, Mood swings,Vaginal dryness has been the only negative with Yaz. The benefits are so numerous - lighter periods_ improved acne_ reduced mood swings_ big reduction in PMS symptoms_ no bloating_ etc. The diuretic just works super good for me_ and it dries me out a lot. So_ I use Estrace a few times a week_ and all is good. If I happen to add an OTC cold pill or allergy pill for seasonal stuff_ the dryness becomes almost painful. But the dryness is totally manageable where the severe personality and acne problems were not.,,F,34,3  years,1/15/2010,Yaz

All of my PMS symptoms have vanished_ including the cramps and moodiness. I lost weight too. I have experienced no adverse side effects_ although I have noticed that I do pee more frequently now (there is a diuretic in Yaz)_ but it doesn't bother me.

Love that part.,Had to go back onto b/c for cramps from endometriosis.  Like this pill - less side effects than most for me.  Feel pretty good_ but the headaches are starting to get old and interfere with my life.  Couldn't handle Yasmin - felt like I had morning sickness all of the time.

111, 4, Birth Control,Spotting the first two weeks after that nothing else.,I started YAZ in July and I actually like it. I do have some concerns for the Lawsuits and horror stories. But_ with all medications I think you have some risk. All those anti-depressant commercial for like Cymbalta (to name one) they mention_ this medication can lead to this and that. I think they making a bigger deal about it and people go in scared expecting something to go wrong. However_ I think YAZ has helped me_ I get one day of a heavy period when I am on my placebo pill and as soon I start my active pill the next two days of my period is light. I get my period the after i take my 3rd placebo pill and for about 4 days. Give it a chance_ if you start taking YAZ make sure you take to your doctor about it thoroughly to make sure it doesn't harm you with any type of other drugs that you may take or medical condition.,F,26,6  months,12/28/2009,Yaz
112, 1, birth control,I first started taking Yaz and I felt fine. However_ after a while I started to get extreme chest pain_ painful cramps_ tenderness in my breasts that would not go away.

115, 2, PMDD & PCOS Symptoms,Vertigo_ frequent bathroom_ really dry skin,Took this with Aldactone b/c of PMDD & PCOS symptoms.  NOT a good idea to take both or best to reduce Aldactone if taking this or you'll be going to the bathroom all the time - including in the middle of the night.  Really helpful w/ the PMDD and depression though.

117, 1, Birth Control,Cramping at random times of the month_ lower back pain_ moodiness_ depression_ recurrent bacterial vaginosis_ headaches_ longer and heavier periods,I had tried a few brands a few years earlier and was not please with the weight gain and nausea_ so I gave Yaz a try 4 months ago.  Now_ I seem to be getting every side effect BUT nausea and weight gain.  My periods are longer and heavier.  I cramp not only during my period_ but a few days after.  I still feel as though I'm ovulating each month (exactly 17 days each month after my period - hard to believe it's coincidental).  I wake up with horrible headaches.  My sex drive is gone and I'm completely dry_ even when aroused.  Twice during this 4 months_ I've felt severely depressed and moody and cry at any given moment.  I never had any menstrual issues or PMS or PMDD before going on Yaz and I feel like it has given me everything it is supposed to ease.,F,25,4  months,12/11/2009,Yaz
118, 5, contraceptive_ regulated periods,possibly lowered sex drive_ but that was after 8 months of taking the pill and it returned some after 2 months,I've never really had an incident with this drug. The reason it's getting a bad rep is because people are taking Motrin or similar drugs regularly with Yaz_ according to my gyno.This has really helped me become more regular.,F,19,12  months,12/10/2009,Yaz
119, 2, Anti-baby meds,Wonderful for three years. Last four months down hill,I took yaz for about three years with no problems. I started working out about eightmonths ago. I do weight training 2x per week and cardio 4x per week. I also eat a low carb and sugar diet. From this plan my weight changed from 125 to 117_ nothing too drastic. Unfortunately along with my new smaller jeans has come: spotting_ cramping_ extream moodiness_ horrible skin_ increased appetite_ and waTer retention. Another friend of mine with the same eating and working out habits Had the same problem. I would not reccomend this to any athletic person or someone who eats a restricted diet. Hormones r too low and metabolize too quickly. Doc is puting me on ortho-novum. Wish me luck.,F,25,3  years,12/10/2009,Yaz
120, 4, birth control,extreme moodiness_ breakthrough bleeding when skipping placebo pills,Cleared up my acne better than anything I've ever tried! Also very effective at preventing pregnancy (which is the point). Plus_ no weight gain_ which is great! However_ it makes me very moody and I cry at the littlest things. Also_ when skipping periods_ breakthrough bleeding ALWAYS occurred for me. Periods also seem to last longer than usual and are pretty heavy.,F,23,8  months,12/9/2009,Yaz

122, 1, birth control,super long bleeding during active pills; severe depression_ panic attacks_ anxiety,I tried taking Yaz a couple of different times. The first time I tried taking it I started to bleed after the first week and the bleeding didn't stop for TWO WEEKS. After 2 weeks I (and my boyfriend) was just fed up and sick with not being able to do anything. It wasn't that Yaz made me upset the first time I took it_ it's that having a two week period made me upset. (Obviously)So I stopped taking it and (naturally) got my period. But halleluia it went away after a few days. I then waited through an entire cycle before trying to start Yaz again. (There was a question about whether I had started it on the right day the first time_ I probably hadn't started it on the right day.) This second time I started Yaz was absolutely miserable. About 2-3 days after I started it I started freaking out and crying all the time and I wanted to jump out in front of a bus. (suicidal thoughts_ panic attacks_ depression) I nearly broke up with my boyfriend because of all of the crazy thoughts that this medication put into my head. I didn't realize that Yaz was causing it for about a week. Abour 2 days after I stopped it I felt 90% emotionally better. I had to start seeing a therapist because of the emotional side effects of Yaz and now that I'm off Yaz I feel SO much better emotionally. I'm still seeing the therapist because I have anticipatory fears that those emotional panic attacks will come back_ but thank god I figured out that it was Yaz that caused it.,F,18,7  days,11/8/2009,Yaz

I've had mild deppression in the past that was always cured by getting some sun.  I have never been this depressed ever.  I hate everything and don't want to do anything.  I cry at the silliest things.  I've acctually thought of harming myself.  I am not like this.  I never want to eat anymore (and I'm a big girl_ I used to love to eat).  I like the fact that I've lost 10 lbs_ but not because I don't want to eat.  I have menstrual cramps all day EVERY day_ they are light_ but are ungodly annoying.  I start screaming at my husband for no reason_ and I've even (very very sadly) snapped at my 5 month old (I yelled ""stop it!"" at him when he was just being a baby_ I did not harm him though).  This is when I realized there has to be something different_ it's the darn pill.  And I also used to be a (as my husband would say) a ""nympho"".  Before the pill and all through my pregnancy I would pretty much demand ""lovins"" about twice a day.  Now I'm lucky if I even feel like doing it once a week.

128, 1, Pre-IVF_ prevention of ovarian cyst,Extreme mood swings and anxiety/depression_ severe breast tenderness and swelling_ nausea_ vomiting_ acne,The entire reason I was taking Yaz was to prevent ovarian cysts (of which I have a known history) before starting an IVF cycle.  I had not had a cyst in two months_ but the month I took the Yaz_ I developed a cyst and my IVF cycle was cancelled (devastating to think I'm waiting another month because this didn't work!).  The breast swelling was bad-- from AA to B cup in less than 5 days_ and I'm still recovering from the pain.  Yaz also caused nausea and vomiting for me.  I'm usually very calm_ but on the Yaz I became another woman entirely-- very moody and anxious.  The acne was the least problematic of the side effects I experienced.  My sister has PCOS_ and she's taken Yaz for many years without any negative experiences.  For me_ it certainly wasn't the right birth control pill.,F,28,2  weeks,10/12/2009,Yaz

Biggest issue - Elevated Potassium,Love this stuff - been on for a year - wish I could stay on it.  I had been off BCP for 7 years - went back on due to total disruption of life w/the pmdd symptoms.  Yaz worked great after getting over the nausea - which will happen with most bc pills when 1st get on them.   My periods_ moods_ & cramps are wonderfully manageable now. However noticed my potassium levels elevated tremendously.  This is a serious situation - elevated levels of K can do damage to your heart and its rythems.

In the last 3 months_ despite no change in lifestyle/eating habits/ etc. I have had a period every other week. Throughout my time on this medication_ I have been fatigued_ lack of interest in socialization_ migraines (I have never had regular headaches prior to taking YAZ)_ vision problems and have gained weight. My skin is worse than it has been in the past. I was not at all satisfied with this product for me_ but several friends are on YAZ and adore it. It was not for my body. I was just prescribed Loestrin today and hopefully will not have such drastic side-effects.,Not good for me. I wish I switched earlier as opposed to being encouraged to 'stick with it' for 7 months by my doctor.

132, 5, irregular periods_ acne,the only side effect i got was sore breasts. it didnt last long and wasnt very severe at all.,i love yaz! i know that people are getting sick and whatever but that doesnt happen to everyone so people just need to talk to their doctor about it. yaz helped my acne so much and i never got bloated or gained weight with it. i have been taking alesse for a few days and i hate it. i have already gained atleast 5 lbs and im feeling sick all day. i was on yaz for like 3 years and i miss it now that i stopped it.:( the only negative thing i have to say about yaz is its expensive... even with insurance it was $50 a pack.,F,,3  years,10/1/2009Email,Yaz
133, 1, Acne,Heavy acne_ depression_ anxiety_ overactive gag reflex_ no sex drive_ dark upper lip_ upset stomach,"This pill was like poison to me! I can't believe I stuck with it for as long as I did because YAZ really did an number on me both physically and emotionally. Out of all of the nasty side effects I had while taking it_ hands down the WORST was the dark upper lip. I noticed that someone else wrote about it_ too. I switched to Loestrin 2 months ago and I'm feeling MUCH better now. However_ I am praying that my dermatologist can help me because my ""YAZ lip"" makes me feel like a freak and my self confidence has deflated quite a bit. I realize that BCPs effect everyone's body differently. But_ I really wouldn't recommend this pill unless you suffer from PPMD and are willing to take the risk that it may do more harm than good.",F,30,6  months,9/30/2009,Yaz
134, 1, Irregular periods_ acne,First month - nausea_ second month - severe headaches. In general - INTERSTITIAL CYSTITIS!,After one month of taking Yaz I began to have frequent urination_ in two months I had pain and blood during urination. I began to spend 400$ per month treating this conditions. Than as a pharmacist I relized that YAZ increases level of potassium which might cause irritation of urinary bladder. I quited to take YAZ and any other drugs. In two month my horrable intersitial cystatis was gone. I hate YAZ. I also got a lump in my left breast after taking YAZ 4 months...,F,24,1  years,9/23/2009Email,Yaz
135, 1, Regulate my menstrual cycle,Drug-induced sweets syndrome_ depression.,I broke out in a skin rash. It started off slowly with a few sores_ but the longer I was on Yaz_ more appeared. On my back_ neck_ face and under the hairline. They were sore_ red lumps and have left scars. Had to have a skin biopsy which showed that I had developed sweets syndrome. A couple of months off Yaz I went back on it at my doctor's request to confirm that it was drug induced. Sure enough_ it came back! I also experienced incredible sadness and cried over all sorts of things. Don't like this drug at all!,F,37,4  months,9/20/2009,Yaz
136, 5, PMDD,,Had a uterine ablation a few years ago to reduce heavy monthly flow so that wasn't an issue but was continuing to have terrible physical and emotional PMDD--bouts of rage during week to 10 days before period--cramps_ horrible acne_ horrible breast swelling_ horrible overall bloating_ etc. Yaz has eliminated ALL PMDD. Although one month did experience 1 day of mood swing but that could have been a fluke. My doctor says I can stay on this until menopause_ which is another 10-15 years away for me and I had hoped to NOT have to be on the pill--especially considering that I've had both an ablation and tubal ligation years ago. But right now I am desperate enough to stay on it to stay sane. My blood pressure has remained excellent (for some on the pill that can be an issue) and have had no notable side effects.,F,40,4  months,9/16/2009,Yaz
137, 3, birth control_ ovarian cysts.,Complete loss of sex drive.I hate to be touched. No weight changes. No mood changes. I don't get my period anymore.,I guess its okay_ other birth controls either gave me mood swings_ or made me gain a lot of weight. I skip my period more often than I get it.,F,24,7  months,9/15/2009,Yaz
138, 3, moderate acne,NO sex drive. Zero_ maybe negative sex drive actually. Vaginal dryness. But it did clear up my bad acne! That was GREAT! Super light periods. No weight change or breast size change. Basically just don't like to be touched anymore.,It really cleared up my acne_ which was probably being caused by a hormone imbalance. I don't have sex_ but I don't even want to be touched or kissed or ANYTHING by my boyfriend anymore. It's very sad for both of us. Hopefully when I get married I'll be able to find something that keeps my face clear and gives me back my normal libido.,F,22,1  years,9/3/2009,Yaz
139, 5, Had headaches with other BC,None other than early on_ I had 2 periods a month if I didn't take my pill the same time every month.,It has been a God send for me.  It's regulated everything.  However_ it's costing me $72 per month...so I am seeking other BC.  I hate changing when this works_ but I can't afford it.  Plus_ I just saw the lawsuit commercial for Yaz/Yasmin and they are saying it can cause strokes & heart attacks.  With me having high Cholesterol_ I can't take the risk...I have to move on.,F,31,2  years,9/1/2009,Yaz
140, 4, mood swings,breast tenderness (only during the first few weeks)_ vaginal dryness,I had a light 3 and a half day period with minimal cramping! Inscreased breast size. My sex drive still exists_ although it has decreased. Dryness is a problem. Without lubrication_ I can be in pain/discomfort after sex due to irritation for about a day. My acne is the same as it has been_ though I've heard it takes a few months for your skin to clear up with Yaz. As far as I can tell_ I'm still my old self and my monthly mood swings are not nearly as bad. I'm not too excited about Yaz_ but it's been working. As long as my side effects are mild and controllable (which they have been)_ I'll stick with it.,F,19,6  weeks,8/27/2009,Yaz
141, 2, PMDD,Itching_ headache_ weeping_ anxiety_ heart palpitations_ nausea_ PMS-like food cravings_ sore throat.,After living with PMDD for many years and zoloft no longer helped_ I thought it was finally time to try OC. I had hoped Yaz would work but after only 5 days I'm quite scared and not sure that it's worth it. I've called my gyno and will probably stop.,F,47,6  days,8/26/2009Email,Yaz
142, 2, birth control,depression_ yeast infections_ increased breast size_ decreased acne,While the increase in cup size and decrease in acne were both amazing_ with time I started to break into tears with no logical explanation other than the awful yeast infections I would get with my period every month. I stopped taking the pill and the depression and yeast infections stopped. I stayed off BC for about a year and am currently trying loestrin.,F,20,3  years,8/25/2009,Yaz
143, 2, Heavy periods_ Ovarian Cysts,Lack of sex drive_ depression_ headaches_ sore throat_ spotting,Yaz caused severe depression and anxiety for me_ especially during my period. It also robbed me of all of my sex drive which made sex very painful due to vaginal dryness. I started getting headaches which became really severe around my period and dull the rest of the month and my throat was constantly sore. Also_ my period would last a week longer than it should have every month. I stuck with it for four months to see if I would adapt to the hormones and that was four months way too long!!,F,26,4  months,8/11/2009,Yaz
144, 5, Perimenopause_ heavy monthly flow,Breast tenderness and enlargement (not a good thing for me),So far I am very satisfied with this Pill.  25 years ago I was prescribed Ortho 1/35_ which I took for 3 years and ended up with a 20 lbs weight gain and breast so big that I had to have a breast reduction surgery.  As soon as I stopped the Ortho I lost most of the weight and I swore to myself that I would never be on the pill again.  A few years later_ after a doctor insisted that the pills were less strong than they used to be_ I was prescribed Desogen....I took this pill for 2 months and had to stop because the weight gain was back and I became totally unstable emotionally.  In the past few years I have started to experience some severe PMS (PMDD) and my menstrual flow has became very heavy to the point that I became anemic. Lately_ I have been having night sweats_ feeling fatigued_ forgetful and totally unstable and irritable. My new doctor thought it would be time for me to consider taking some hormones because I am in perimenopause so I decided to give YAZ a try.  I have no nausea because I take the pill before I go to bed at night.I also try to take it at exactly the same time to avoid break through bleeding.  I sleep better (no night sweats except when I am on the sugar pills)_ my emotions are stable (no more weird behavior that might create problems at work or with the hubby)_ my skin glows and I did not gain weight.,F,43,5  weeks,8/8/2009,Yaz
145, 1, Birth control,mood swings-anger_ random crying_ personality changed. Extremely painful cystic acne around chin/jaw area.,Yaz was the first birth control pill I tried. I had heard such great things about it from others_ that I thought I would try it. It was horrible for me. It gave me extreme mood swings and I would cry in public for no reason_ and I was always angry for no reason. It also gave me the worst cystic acne I have ever seen. (I used to have mild/moderate acne) The cysts were deep and painful and took months to disappear_ even after I stopped taking it. I now have scars from it. I also take Loestrin 24 Fe and I am MUCH happier.,F,24,2  months,8/7/2009,Yaz
146, 3, Mild acne_ birth control,No significant side effects that are extremely apparent.  I feel tired during the day but restless at night. No moodiness or irritablility like with Loestrin. My acne breakouts are minimal.  I have a few tiny pimples forming but unlike before I used to get one or two major pimples.  This [so far] hasn't completely cleared my skin but it may be too soon to tell.  I'm still in the analysis stage for this product.,,F,37,16  days,8/4/2009,Yaz
147, 3, birth control,vaginal dryness_ loss of sex drive_ irritability_ depression,This pill had no drastically bad side effects as I was afraid it would_ however_ it did totally rob me of any desire for sex whatsoever  basically defeating its own purpose. When I did have sex it was painful and uncomfortable due to the dryness. I have been depressed since before starting the pill so I don't blame it for that_ however_ it did intensify the feelings of sadness and apathy greatly and made it harder to get over them. This pill still has positive qualities and I would probably recommend it over others. I used it for 4 months with no other form of protection(in an exclusive relationship) and it did its job perfectly.,F,19,4  months,8/4/2009,Yaz
148, 4, Contraceptive_ menses supression,No side effects.,I have been on numerous b/c pills over the span of the past 20 years. I've had problems with all of them until this. Clearly_ by reading the other comments_ everyone has a different experience. Hormone pills are tricky - and work differently with everyone. My skin looks great_ my mood is good_ my sex drive is great_ no issues with lubrication_ and best of all...no periods! The only downfall is that it's expensive with my medical insurance.,M,37,18  months,7/27/2009,Yaz
149, 4, for acne /pregnancy,weight loss,I started taking yaz become i was braking out a little bit also i was very moody after having my daughter ...yaz worked great for me my face was so clear and my mood swings went away i only complain about loosing so much weight i lost about 15 pounds,F,23,1  days,7/22/2009,Yaz
150, 1, contraception,depression_ sadness_ loneliness_ anxiety_ pimples,Been on this drug for a month and I have not felt this terrible for a long time. I am constsntly snapping at everyone_ angry_ low self esteem_ cry about 20 times a day_ and dont feel like my life is worth living. Have made an appointmeat today to get off this crap. Anything has gotta be beter.,F,27,1  months,7/20/2009,Yaz
151, 2, cramps_ birth control,complete loss of sex drive,This drug completely killed my sex drive. It was awful.,F,22,1  years,7/13/2009,Yaz
152, 1, birth control,nausea_ weight gain_ headaches_ moodiness_ sleepiness,i started taking this after my daughter was born b/c other pills weren't working to my satisfaction. this one was the WORST. it made me feel so horrible in the first few weeks i actually thought i was pregnant again and took three tests in three weeks to confirm a negative. i also gained 10 pounds in 3 weeks. i couldn't keep taking it for the remainder of the pack.,F,28,3  weeks,7/13/2009,Yaz
153, 2, PMDD_ acne_ prevent pregnancy,bad: ACNE! even worse than b4_ never had pimples so freaquently and deep_ sex drive basically gone! not able to stay wet during intercourse. feel like eating all the time in the 2nd and 3rd weeks_ yeast infections.good: no pregnancy so far. cramps are gone and very light periods.,,F,20,2  months,7/10/2009,Yaz
154, 3, PMDD,zero sex drive,Even though it helps with PMDD I'm sure I would have been fine on other pill. This pill definitely shortened my periods from 6 days to 1. I switched to Femcon Fe begining of May but I've been off the pill for about 4 weeks. Two months and still no period. What I hated about Yaz no sex drive. My dr told me it's a big side effect of this pill. It was so bad to the point that  wouldnt even think about sex..ugh.,F,29,10  months,7/3/2009,Yaz
155, 1, mail order rx sent it by mistake,uncontrollable weight loss_ dry cracked skin_ facial breakouts_ SIGNIFICANT HAIR LOSS_ red freckles,This is a scary product_ and unfortunately I didn't do my homework before taking it.  My mail order sent it to me by mistake_ and I didn't have time to get it changed to Orthotricylen which I had been on for 10 years with no problem. First I started losing weight_ which was great_ but then it didn't stop and people told me I looked drawn and sick.  Simultaneiously my skin appeared to be aging FAST. I thought it was from either winter cold or from the weight loss.  Then... the worst happened_ my hair started falling out.  So I called my doctor and she asked about any new medication and that's when it dawned on me.  I switched off of YAZ immediately_ but the damage is done.  I am actually considering a hair transplant and am seeing a dermatologist for skin issues_ and I've become depressed.  I had always been fortunate with great skin and hair_ now I am a mess thanks to this poison.,F,39,1  years,6/28/2009,Yaz
156, 1, pregnancy prevention,anxiety/panic attacks_ sadness/depression_ loss of sex drive_ lack of lubrication_ frequent urination_ the need to drink a LOT of water_ breakthrough bleeding,I had a horrible experience with Yaz.  I was anxious all the time and started having random panic attacks.  I felt sad and depressed for no reason_ and started having thoughts of self-harm.  There were days where I didn't feel like doing anything.  My sex drive basically disappeared.It was my first time on the pill_ so I waited it out for three months before I decided it was time to try something else.  I switched to Loestrin 24 FE and so far things have been great!  I feel a LOT better and my sex drive is back.I would say if you're having significant side effects with ANY pill_ you should try something else.  Different people react differently to different pills.  But Yaz was NOT for me.,F,28,3  months,6/17/2009,Yaz
157, 2, Moodiness_ Irregular cycle,After two months of taking Yaz I started having severe stomach cramping which seemed to occur after lunchtime (I took the pill in the AM). As each month passed_ my stomach issues increased so much that I thought I had irritable bowl_ celiacs disease_ etc. After 8 months of complete discomfort and severe diarrhea I had a colonoscopy. The results of the colonoscopy came back with perfect results and the next step was an upper GI series of tests. I decided to go off of the Yaz because I suspected this could be the cause of my stomach issues. Two days after stopping Yaz my system was back to normal and I had no further discomfort or diarrhea. Yaz was absolutely the problem with my bowel problems -- I really hope this information helps someone else. It was a pretty miserable 8 months with a lot of scary symptoms.,,F,40,8  months,6/16/2009Email,Yaz
158, 3, acne,At first i was depressed for a week or two and wanted to die. yaz DOES MAKE you feel like SHIT. then it went away. Cramps did not go away - I think I even had a tad more. But acne cleared up! my skin became way way less oily - which is why zits stopped ruining my face. BUT! the worst f all - it happens after about 5-6 months. My nails started cracking. I have no nails at all now_ and what I have left - is also all in splits and layers_ and it goes on and on and on. I stopped Yaz for a month - nails became healthier! (but acne came back too). So I picked the lesser evil and said bye bye to nails. :(,,F,29,6  months,6/15/2009,Yaz
159, 4, pregnancy prevention,potassium levels increased; nausea,I had very few issued with this pill.  The nausea I experienced_ I managed by taking the pill each night before bed time as my Dr. suggessted.  The only reason I got off this pill is because I was not longer sexually active.  I was thinking about switching due to my potassium levels being elevated but after researching my other options_ I'm gonna stick with it.,F,29,2  years,6/11/2009,Yaz
160, 3, acne,headaches_ libido low _ depression,,F,31,1  years,5/31/2009,Yaz
161, 3, contraception,slight depression_ down_ anxious_ not my normal upbeat self.,yaz is the first and only bc pill i have taken.  i was on it for about a year and a half.  i was forgetting to take pills and was doubling up a lot.  i decided to go off of it just to see how my body would react.  i feel as though a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.  on the pill_ i felt like every task too so much effort out of me.  i didn't feel like my normal self.  however_ yaz did help with my previous pmdd symptoms which were extreme mood swings.  i did experience slight weight gain_ but i hear most pills do.  and since going off the pill my headaches and migraines have disappeared.  i plan on talking to my doctor about another pill to try to replace yaz.  if other pills don't work out for me_ i wouldn't mind going back on yaz.,F,20,1.5  years,5/29/2009,Yaz
162, 1, prevent extreme cramps,Mood swings_ depression.,This pill scared me to death. Before taking YAZ I was always in a good mood. Once on the pill I was easily annoyed_ tardy_ and just didn't care. I was always moody and constantly arguing with my friends.,F,18,2  weeks,5/25/2009,Yaz
163, 2, acne,I was on Yaz for only 4 months from switching from Ortho-tricyclen which I had been on for about 5 years. I took this because Ortho made me feel moody and crazy and I wanted to be done experiencing this.  4 months later my skin was aweful whiteheads everywhere and I was so bloated that I kept taking pregnacy tests because I couldn't believe how popped out my stomach was. My mood was better compared to the ortho_ but still not 'normal'. I quit taking Yaz and in only less than a week my skin cleared and I have been off of it for a month now.. no break outs.  Not one pimple! My clothes fit normal again_ I don't look like I am 4 months pregnat!,I think this affects all of us differently.  I am actually glad I didn't wait the symptoms out.  I think 4 months was long enough to give my body to adjust to this pill.,F,28,4  months,5/15/2009,Yaz
164, 2, Birth Control,ANXIETY 3 Weeks Per Pack,I thought Yaz was meant to uplift and clear skin. I still experienced cystic acne but the worst part was the ANXIETY - I had never experienced it like that before. The week before my period was a PERSONAL HELL being on Yaz. I could NOT figure out why - until it finally dawned on me that it was the same time each month and then started to slow down. My mind would race and I was very upset one week out of the month. I am not on TRINESSA 28 and hoping for a better month!,F,30,2  years,5/8/2009,Yaz
165, 5, pms_ cramps_ heavy periods,Happier mood_ clearer complexion,I just started yaz this month (I switched from necon 7/7/7)_ and am already so much happier.  I am in a much better mood_ my skin looks almost perfect (I was breaking out really bad from previous bc pill)_ and my stomach/waistline is already a little smaller (pants are looser). I am assuming this is due to the diuretic properties of Yaz.  Would highly recommend to give this a try.,F,33,1  months,4/23/2009,Yaz
166, 5, HEAVY periods_ mood swings,very light to non-existent periods_ no moodiness,I was on it for a year - for very heay bleeding_ mood_ etc(symptoms of PMDD) and it definitely helped.  I had no complaints.  When I went for my annual check up in November 08_ the nurse practioner said that I could skip my periods all together by starting the next pack when I should take the white_ inert tablets.  She said that I could do this for three months and then let myself have a period.  I thought this was great.  I started this and had my first period in late January 09 and it is the usual light kind I was used to.  So I stared my next pack after the 4 white pills and the next 24 days were fine.  As I stared the next pack_ I started to have lite bleeding.  I thought it was normal_ just break through.  But it kept up all month.  I skipped the white pills again and just started the next pack on 4/9/09 - and I am now having heavy bleesding ( clotting_ etc)  like before Yaz.  The moodiness has returned as well.  There has been a noticable change in me in the last month.  I am very bothered by this_ since  the only recent change was to let my body have a period.  After reading some comments here_ I am also realizing that the depression I have been dealing with over the last year_ may now be related to this pill.  But that I am not sure about.  I will be seeing my doctor this week.  This pill worked wonders for me until this last month - so I am worried about taking something else.  I just don't want to go back the periods etc I had before Yaz.,F,41,18  months,4/12/2009,Yaz
167, 2, for lighter periods_ acne,BAD: major weight gain_ horrendous mood swingsGOOD: acne cleared up_ periods were significantly lighter,I read the comments before I took this and I took a chance.  From the beginning I had felt light-headed and dizzy_ but stayed with it.  In the past 2 months since taking it_ my boyfriend has been hit with the worst mood swings ever! I'm surprised he's lasted through this.  I'm very irritable and on edge.  The weight gain has probably been the worst.  I have never gained this much weight so fast (except when i was pregnant)and been unable to get rid of it (i've always been small.) I have already called my doctor to get me on something else.  I am done with this pill.,F,31,3  months,4/9/2009,Yaz
168, 1, Endometriosis,Extreme moodiness_ fatigue_ crying_ blurry vision when wearing contacts,I seriously do NOT recommend this pill! The side effects were very bad and I couldn't figure out why.Well...duh.Should have researched before trying. I am so happy I stopped using it after 3 weeks. The side effects are terrible. Acne outbreak on my face and back_fatigue_serious mood swings_depression.I also experienced blurry vision which is now prompting me to go get my eyes checked.That's fine if the doctors tell you it takes 2-3 months for your body to adjust_ but no thank you! Hopefully it won't take long to detox and get this out of my system.,F,27,3  weeks,4/5/2009,Yaz
169, 5, PMDD,none that I'm aware of,This really is a magical pill for me. I have severe PMDD and it made it SOO much better. What I gather from the ratings... don't take this if you don't have PMDD as it will pretty much give you it.. but if you have it_ it will cure you (that is_ as long as you're on it. I went off the pill for a week and all my symptoms came back). YAZ saved my life_ I'm back to being my old self again. But don't take it if you don't have PMDD!,F,19,1.5  years,4/3/2009,Yaz
170, 1, prevent pregnency_ heavy periods,Depression_ emotional mood swings_ change in personality_  severe bloating and weight gain.,Horrible! This pill caused severe weight gain_ no matter how hard i would diet and exercise nothing would come off. Also caused depression. My doctor put me on anti-depressents_ no one told me this pill caused depression until i did my own research and found out for myself. I was a whole different person for 2 years! Almost ruined my relationship. Research needs to be done on this medication.,F,21,2  years,3/30/2009,Yaz
171, 5, PMDD,large increase in breast size (I consider this a negative)_ some anxiety_ some weight gain,Despite the small side effects I experienced_ this pill saved my life-no question.  I had severe depresssion_ muscle aches_ fatigue_ debilitating migraines.  Doctors had put me on every medication imaginable and I never noticed a thing.  Within a week of starting YAZ I woke up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the world.,F,36,2  years,3/29/2009,Yaz
172, 1, reduce the size of a cyst,weight gain_ moody_ severe depression_ no interest in sex,I don't think the pharmaceutical company did any research on this horrible pill.  It completely changed my personality-I went from being a calm person to someone who could barely keep her emotions in tact.  It also made me gain weight- I'm very waif like and after being on this pill for a few months I developed larger arms_ a belly (no wait a BELLY) and cellulite in the back of my legs.  To top it off_ I was taking this pill to reduce the size of an ovarian cyst and it did the exact opposite-the thing doubled in size in a matter of 9 months.  This pill is awful and I don't recommend it to anyone.,F,32,9  months,3/24/2009,Yaz
173, 3, prevent pregnancy_ irregular period,VERY BAD MOOD SWINGs AND Weight gain!! My mom was about to wring my neck..Decreased sex drive_ lost my boyfriend_ Just wasnt normal_ wasnt myself at all,I had very bad anger problems_ i wouldnt think about things before i acted and most of the time i majorly over reacted.  My sex drive went out the window_ sex wasnt a big deal to me anymore and thats not good when your in a relationship and sex is a very important thing to a healthy relationship.  I stopeed taking my yaz pills and my ob and i talked and i mentioned ORTHO TRI CYCLEN LO and i have heard great things!! Many of my friends have taken it and i start my pills the next period i have and im very excited!!! Since being off the Yaz i lost my weight,F,17,5  months,3/17/2009,Yaz

177, 4, PMDD,NO SEX DRIVE!!!  None!  Zero!  Zilch!  What is sex cause I have NO sex drive!,The FDA is requiring Yaz to change its advertising.  Its not for all of these other issues people mention on this site.  Its for PMDD sufferers only - but if course Bayer wanted to make more money - so they market Yaz as a cure-all for anything menstrual related.  Yaz works VERY WELL if you are a true PMDD sufferer.  eliminates the EXTREME mood swings during menustration.,F,37,1  years,2/19/2009,Yaz
178, 1, Birth Control,nausea_ loss of appetite_ fatigue_ acne_ low/no sex drive_ mood swings_ breekthrough bleeding or spotting_ yeast infection_ vaginal dryness,After reading the comments on the web (this site and others) about this drug_ I'm not sure why women take it all.  I wish I had done my research!  I started looking up breakthrough bleeding associated with Yaz because my period hasn't stopped since I started this pill.  Now I realize how many other changes in my body have happened in the past few weeks.  My poor boyfriend has really been through it these past few weeks_ from the mood swings_ to the loss of sex drive...Then with the vaginal dryness_ sex is a bit painful...and I got a yeast infection!  I'm a foodie_ love to eat_ but I've lost my appetite and barely even think about eating.  I don't want to bash this drug_ but based on my experience I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!  Now I just need to figure out if I should stop taking this pill mid-cycle...,F,27,2  weeks,2/18/2009,Yaz
179, 1, birth control,I have only been taking YAZ for one month...but have no SEX drive_ having mood swings and have been getting burning in stomach area and having lose stools.I have felt horrible the whole month.,I would strongly warn any woman about taking this birth control pill. I was ready to move out of my bed with my husband never wanting to have sex. Thought it was cause I am a new mom-again. But after reading the other comments makes me think it must be the YAZ. I am know hopeful my stomach problems will go away and I will not feel so depressed.,F,39,30  days,2/15/2009,Yaz
180, 1, PCOS_ PMDD_ Endrometriosis,Headaches_ depression_ anxiety_ rage_ bloating_ nausea_ weight gain_ extreme mood swings and yeast infection.,The first month of Yaz I thought I found the cure_ other than feeling bloated everything was great!! Minimal pain during my cycle with a lighter flow and no clotting! The second month is when it all began..depression was the first/feeling empty inside. I lost intrest in everything! My mood swings and rage took over and the rest is history refered to in my house now as the 'Yaz episode'. The rage and mood swings were unbelievable. My Doctor said 'it should straighten out if you give it time'....The only choice at the time was stop taking Yaz and have sanity in my life (not to mention save my marriage) or admit my self into a mental institution. I would NOT recommed Yaz!!!,F,31,2  months,2/13/2009Email,Yaz
181, 1, Perimenopause,Fatigue_ adrenaline crashes with extreme fatigue_ panic attacks_ muscle weakness,I do not recommend this pill to anyone.  The diuretic is what causes most of the problems with YAZ. If you are taking YAZ and do not feel well and cannot live your normal daily life_ please consider switching to another pill.,F,48,1  years,2/9/2009,Yaz
182, 5, regulate periods,After taking Yaz for a year I started having really heavy and long periods which was the reason I was put on the pill in the first place.,I took Yaz for about a year and a half. During the first year it was great. It was the only pill I had taken where I didn't gain weight. I only had a light period that lasted 5 days each month and I knew exactly when to expect it. Then after a year my periods became heavy and started lasting twice as long. My doctor then told me to take it continuously with out any placebo pills. For about 3 months this was great because I didn't have to worry about a period at all. Then I started bleeding in the middle of a pack and it didn't stop for a month. My doctor put me on Ovcon to stop the bleeding but I've had really uncomfortable bloating and I'm gaining weight like I did on other pills. I really wish I could go back on Yaz.,F,21,1.5  years,2/7/2009,Yaz
183, 4, oral contraceptive,SEX DRIVE IS ZERO!,"I am a fan of yaz...except for the one HUGE side effect...NO sex drive.  i chalked up my no sex drive to stress or being ""not on the mood""...come to find out it was my birth control.  Other than that i have no acne_ periods are almost not even periods...no need for a pad or tampon a panti-liner for 2 days is plenty...weight loss...and no mood swings...i would get off birth control entirely but i am getting married in October...i dont know ladies it sucks being a girl!",F,25,1.5  years,2/6/2009,Yaz
184, 1, Birth control,First month= Loss of appetite_ upset stomach_ cramping. A week in a half in a heavy 7 day bleed (like a full blown period) tender breasts and hard cysts developed.  Month 2 = Horrible acne outbreak (I had clear skin before)looks like severe measles all over my neck and under chin_ along with forehead and cheeks.  So depressing!  And now I have no sex drive.,Ummm went on this pill so I could have better sex with my boyfriend and this pill is causing a total rift between us.  My mood has changed_ I feel sad and angry_ my boobs hurt_ I have no urge to have sex_ and worst of all is my face- it looks like severe chicken pox!  I would recommend this pill to your worst enemy!  Ladies beware.  This pill should not be legal.  By the way I had to go to the dermatologist who told me I should go on antibiotics to help reduce my acne_ and I will probably need a chemical peel to avoid scarring on my neck. Hmm so far I've spent Yaz $55 copay + $35 derm copay + $25 antibiotics + new BC $56  = $171.00 WOW that sucks! Ya know who the eff runs the FDA & who do they test this sh*t on?,F,25,2  months,2/6/2009Email,Yaz
185, 1, PMDD/irregular mentral cycle,It did regulate my cycle.Cons: I started having severe depression and could not figure out why.,After taking yaz I needed to take a antidepressant and finally figured out what the problem was.  After stopping Yaz I noticed an immediate change and stopped the anti-depressant also.  What a nightmare!!!,F,44,1  years,2/4/2009,Yaz
186, 3, Skin breakouts,depression at first_ lump in left breast_ insomnia,Just wanted to give some of my opinion on the drug. Have only been taking it for 2 months. 29 healthy non smoker_ exercise regularly. At first it threw me into unbelievable depression - could not sleep_ did not want to live. Crazy. Then I still kept taking it and depression was gone after a week or 2 but a big lump appeared in left breast_ hurt like hell. As it appeared_ suddenly_ as suddenly - Overnight! - it dissolved 3 weeks later. Skin got better_ I can tell that.,F,29,2  months,2/2/2009,Yaz
187, 2, For Heavy Periods & Cramping,This is the second birth control that I have ever used and I don't like it really all that much. As_ it doesn't help with severe cramping all that well and it doesn't really lighten my flow at all. Also_ I get increased headaches with it. And_ even though it is supposed to help with PMS_ it really hasn't done a thing any thing much to help with that at all. I will not be staying with this pill anymore even though I have used it for around a year and a half. Instead_ I do plan to switch to another low-dose pill_ but that actually dose work alot better!,If you suffer from PMS or severe cramping and a heavy flow_ then this pill won't do much at all to help with any of these symptoms.,F,33,1  years,1/22/2009,Yaz
188, 1, birth control,extreme depression_ migraines_ complete loss of libido_ severe anxiety attacks,I switched to this drug from the depo shot because my new insurance didn't cover the depo and I was experiencing abnormal bleeding during intercourse and a lot of breakthrough bleeding after being on it for a year_ my doctor's nurse recommended switching to Yaz. I never experienced depression_ anxiety or loss of libido until I started this drug. It was absolutely horrible. I thought something was horribly wrong with me_ I almost left my husband because of the huge wall that was building between us. I take care of my 2 kids during the day and it took everything in me to just get out of bed_ then I would spend the rest of the day curled up on the couch_ then back to bed in the evening. I had no life_ I was neglecting my family_ and I just felt so lost. I warned all the women in my life and all my doctors of my serious side effects. I didn't of course know it was from this drug till I seeked help from a psychiatrist_ apparently this is rather common. Wish I would have known that before I,F,25,4  months,1/22/2009,Yaz
189, 5, awful PMS and BC,none,I LOVED Yaz.  I have tremendous PMS/PMDD - become aggressive_ depressed_ irrational_ etc.  Yaz took care of it within 2 months.  I was much happier and more pleasant to be around.  I had to go off of it after 7 months b/c I had my first migraine (very scary with TIA/stroke symptoms - look into stroke risk for Yaz).  I was very upset to go off Yaz and and will miss the relief it provided.,F,33,7  months,1/19/2009,Yaz
190, 2, ,Frequent yeast infections_ depression_ break through bleeding_ loss of sex drive_ severe migraines during first months_ I went from never crying to crying at the slighest thing.,As for the good_ I actually lost weight with YAZ. My acne cleared up and I never had a pimple in sight. Shorter_ lighter periods.,F,19,1  years,1/14/2009,Yaz
191, 2, ,weight gain_ extreme moodiness,I was very unhappy the entire time I was taking this pill. I have been on it for eightmonths and i am current switting to mircette becuase I gained ten pounds_ I cried just about every day and felt like the entire world was out to get me. I also spent the first  months on the pill sleeping. I got serious headaches and felt tired all the time. I hope mircette is a better choice.,F,18,8  months,1/13/2009,Yaz
192, 2, BC/Regular Periods/Preventing Cysts,Severe mood swings and severe depression around time of period. Constant spotting and no help with preventing cysts. Extremely emotional!,I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I have been on it for a year and thought that something was wrong with me the entire time. I constantly felt alone_ sad_ and sometimes even angry. These feelings were provoked by the simplest things such as by boyfriend calling me half an hour later than usual etc. I never knew that severe mood swings was a side effect but as soon as I found out I got off the pill and practically got my life back.,F,19,1  years,1/12/2009,Yaz
193, 1, Painful Cramps/Endometriosis,Constant postnasal drip_ nightsweats_ itchy throat_ upper respiratory infection_ painful burning stomach aches_ stomach noise_ nausea_ loose bowels_constipation weight loss_ painful cold sores.,"I gave this drug an honest_ fair_ and unbiased shot for two miserable months_ as directed by doc. The side effects I got strongly resembled pancreatitis with loud stomach noises_ horrible stomach pain and burning with some loose stools. I was sick with itchy cough/chest issues for a month until I took antibiotics & prednisone. I got a painful cold sore for the first time in my life. Post nasal drip clogged my throat for three whole months. Doc said ""herpes"" is common but I am in a monogamous relationship and neither of us has it_ and if we did_ no flare up. Maybe it was due to low immune system. Whatever the case_ this drug was horrible. Sex? What sex? As soon as I got off_ I was better within the day. Should consumers_ WOMEN put up with this? I say we stand up and not take this any more. I have so much menstrual pain I HAVE to take something and no pain med works. What to do eh?",F,32,80  days,1/12/2009,Yaz
194, 5, Birth Control/ Pmdd,Nausea,I've been on Yaz for 4+ years. After trying more BCPs that I can even remember_ this was the only to help with all my pmdd symptoms. I was nauseas the first few days of taking it if I remember correctly. But other than that it has been great My periods are regular and last only 2-3 days. I have recently started getting bad cramping again which I plan on addressing with my doctor. I used to get yeast infections every month on orto and ortho lo dose_ also on desogen_ since changing to yaz this doesn't happen anymore either.,F,24,4  years,1/6/2009,Yaz
195, 1, Mood Swings,Headaches_ no sex drive_ weepiness_ depression_,Ladies_ i beg of you_ dont take this pill! I started it about 8 months ago. The first 2 months were great. Then i started becoming someone unlike me. I wasnt talkative_ took myself out of social settings_ was weepy and crying and i constantly though people were out to get me. I was a basketcase! Plus this pill is great if ur addicted to sex cause it makes u NOT HAVE ANY!! Dont ever take this pill. It almost cost me my realtionship and my mental health,F,23,8  months,1/4/2009,Yaz
196, 1, Birth control / Acne,FATIGUE_ moodiness_ nausea_ no sex drive_ headachesslight improvement in acne_ shorter periods_ no weight gain.,This pill has been great by having shorter periods and clearing up my skin but the side effects are NOT worth it. I am extremely tired ALL the time_ nausea after I eat_ headaches_ moodiness and depression (which isnt like me). No sex drive...This is a great pill to prevent pregnancy b/c you'll never want to have sex. My sister is taking this pill and has no problems so i guess it depends on the person.This will be my last pack!!,F,22,6  months,1/2/2009,Yaz
197, 1, Heavy_ long period and large clots,Muscle aches and spasms_ couldn't even stretch out without my muscles locking up. Later my Dr. told me it had a diuretic. Switched me to Femcom with worse muscle spasms and aches. Don't know what to do now.,It did stop my long_ heavy periods and clotting by the second month.,F,35,45  days,12/31/2008,Yaz
198, 2, Bad Cramps,Horrible post nasal drip_ itchy sore throat_ cough_ bowel issues (stomach aches_ loose bowels etc) fatigue_ vaginal dryness.,Fine for the first month and now I have an itchy dry bronchitis-like cough and strange upper respiratory symptoms that don't go away no matter what I do. I'm not sure what these chemists/docs/drug companies are doing with our meds/and bodies these days_ but this can't be normal. I don't think helping consumers or patients is the main goal. Instead_ docs are looking for bonuses and handing out these meds without a single care in the world and it is very angering anf depressing. I gave this drug a fair shot and this is a definite NO GO.,F,32,50  days,12/29/2008,Yaz
199, 1, birth control_ hormone imbalance,heavy spotting_ more frequent migraines_ interfered with my thyroid levels,I took the name brand Yaz_ not a generic.  This pill was great for about 6 weeks.  I never missed a pill and always took them at the same time each day.  Then I started heavy spotting half way through the 2nd pack_ with golf-ball sized clots.  I have suffered from migraines for years at the rate of 1-2 per month.  While on Yaz_ the migraines increased to about 6 per month. I finally stopped Yaz in the 4th month due constant heavy bleeding for 2+ weeks.  My doctor advised me to stop taking it. After stopping Yaz_ it took 3 full months for the side effects to stop and for my system to return to normal. I contacted the manufacturer and they were very helpful.  This is a new drug_ so if you have any adverse reactions_ you should do the same.  They are required to file a report with the FDA and run testing on the remainder of the prescription.,F,31,4  months,12/22/2008,Yaz
200, 1, Mainly to control my fybroid growth,Severe insomnia_ really severe.  Didn't realize Yaz was causing it until I went to the Dr. and he asked that I stay off of it for a week so he could do some tests. Turns out it was the best week of sleep I ever had. I haven't used it since and I sleep much better than I did. They say it has high cortizone levels.,,F,40,2  years,12/22/2008,Yaz
201, 5, BC_ PMDD_ Cramps_ Acne,,After a couple months my face cleared up and my mood stablized which was a life-saver.

My periods are basically non-existant and I experience no cramps.,F,27,1.2  years,12/15/2008,Yaz
202, 4, Mindbending Cramps/PMS,At first mild antidepressant-like symptoms: clenching teeth_ vivid dreams_ getting hot and sweaty at night_ 8 lb weight loss_ mild stomach aches_ dry skin.,I've suffered from horrible cramps all my adult life that didn't respond to 800mgs of ibuprofen_ vicodin_ or ultracet. I was afraid of the side effects (blood clots_ weight gain_ etc.)So far so good. No weight gain_ big boobs_ nausea_ or emotional changes. Waiting on 1st period due in two days and will update to see if cramps are helped. I take probiotic daily to avoid vaginal dryness & yeast infections-it works.,F,32,1  months,12/10/2008,Yaz
203, 5, birth control,none,Yaz is the best birth control pill I ever have used. I use it continuously without menstruation breaks per doctors recommendation. It keeps my mood stable_ no water retention_ no acne_ no breast sensitivity. It works wonderfully for me.,F,41,2  years,12/8/2008,Yaz

Increase in acne_ never had acne before_ now have 2-3 major huge pimples at a time.,told to give it time for my hormones to settle into it,F,26,20  days,11/25/2008,Yaz
206, 2, Birth Control,Weight Gain_ NO SEX DRIVE,Ive been on Yaz for 2 years and it finally hit me_ after reading all of these posts_ that its the YAZ that has my sex drive at non-existant.  Other than that i had no issues- im trying the nuva ring- ive read not so good reviews about this too but i'll never know unless i try!,F,30,2  years,11/18/2008,Yaz
207, 1, birth control,Double to triple period length,Maybe it's just my body that can't handle it_ but the first month I took Yaz_ my period was 11 days and the next month it was 15 days.  I immediately switched back to Yasmin after this and haven't had any problems since.,F,23,2  months,11/17/2008,Yaz
208, 2, birth control,none_ at least that can be traced to yaz_ BUT i havent gotten my period in 2 months and i know i'm not pregnant,I switched to yaz from the Mirena IUD (which was causing some serious problems) - i didnt get my period while on Mirena_ and i have been on yaz for 2 months and STILL havent gotten it.  I have 2 kids and was always very regular in my cycle previously.  It did NOT help my skin problems as promised.,F,31,2  months,11/12/2008,Yaz
209, 1, Acne_ shorter lighter periods,weight gain_ cellulite,Yaz made my periods shorter and cramp free. It also improved my acne at first I thought that it was a miracle drug. After about 2 months of taking yaz I gained 8 lbs and a ton of cellulite! I spent 3 months trying to lose the weight and reduce the cellulite but nothing worked until i stopped taking it!!,F,22,5  months,11/12/2008,Yaz
210, 2, Regulate Period,Moodiness_ Cramps worsened_ worse acne_ slight depression,At first I really liked Yaz because my period was regulated_ however after being on it for 4 months I have experienced worse cramps_ have gotten acne which I never had_ and am moody and depressed a lot!,F,18,4  months,11/11/2008,Yaz
211, 1, ,devastating fatigue_ absolutely horrible mood swings_ constant period for three months_ migraines,Although I actually lost about eight pounds in the three months that I took Yaz_ it definitely wasn't worth the side effects. I started spotting after a week of first taking the pill_ and my period didn't go away for the entire three months I was taking the pill! I even got a UTI from wearing tampons for that long! I also felt so crazy and irritable_ and always felt like I was on the verge of falling asleep. This is the worst birth control I have ever taken.,F,20,90  days,11/8/2008,Yaz
212, 2, Contraception,Positive: reduced acne_ shorter periods_ no weight gain Negative: Breakthrough bleeding and nausea for the first month and a half_ no sex drive at all,For the most part the breakthrough bleeding and nausea only lasted a month. The nausea stopped after I started taking the pill at night. I stopped it because the pill was taking a toll on my sex drive. I was disgusted with sex_ had extreme vaginal dryness which provoked pain during sex and infections. I could deal with all side effects except loss all libido. What's the point of birth control if you don't want to have sex?,F,23,8  months,10/29/2008,Yaz

215, 1, Birth control,Inappropriate and hideous mood swings.  Slight improvement in acne and weight but urinated a lot so that was probably why.,I can't imagine that anyone could be on this drug without being on an antidepressant or mood stabilizer.  I alternated between happy_ irritated/nasty and then I would well up and cry for no reason and feel depressed. Had to go off - I was afraid I would lose my job and friends for yelling at them.  I could not control it and normally I can control bad moods - which are rare for me.  Many Yaz reviews are embedded in Yasmin and many complaints were exactly the same as mine and in fact_ the drug_ within the Yasmin platform_ rates 2.2.,F,34,1  months,10/13/2008,Yaz
216, 1, regulate periods_ birth control,emotional_ breasts huge_ periods irregular in a new way_ dryness_ dizziness_ exhausted all the time,extremely tired all the time_ cried way more than usual_ very emotional_ anxious_ a little dizzy... regarding period: first 3 months it came the last day of the placebo pills and usually lasted for the first week of the new pack. 4th and final month_ it finally came on time. also felt itchy and dry_ like i now need a lubricant. also_ initial breast tenderness_ and breasts huge throughout. really looking forward to being off of this one!,F,36,4  months,10/9/2008,Yaz
217, 3, Birth control,weight gain,I switched from Yasmin to Yaz because I noticed that Yasmin caused me to be very moody and depressed. I mentally feel wonderful on Yaz. I have gained 15 pounds while on Yaz and I cannot lose the weight - even after exercising 5x a week and meeting with a nutritionist to make sure that I am eating correctly. Having to change from Yaz because I can't lose the weight.,F,25,11  months,10/8/2008,Yaz
218, 5, control bleeding/cramping/pms,full breast,i have had a wonderful experience_ went from having 14 day periods to about 2-3 days. My skin does look better and my pms gone. Weight gain not an issue. My husband is so HAPPY!!! ME Too!!,F,29,8  months,10/7/2008,Yaz
219, 3, birth control,I also got a mustache-looking shadow due to using Yaz. I hate it. I'm taking a prescription bleaching cream to see if that helps.,It helped make my periods a lot lighter and clear my skin. My PMS symptoms of moodiness and being overly emotional did get better with Yaz. BUT I didn' feel like myself during non-PMS days. I can't describe it_ but I felt like I couldn't concentrate or focus as well on school work while on the pill...I was on edge. I'm naturally a high strung person_ and Yaz seemed to make me more high strung than I cared to be.,F,31,6  times,10/3/2008,Yaz
220, 2, B/C,Extreme mood swings,I took Yaz for two months.  It regulated my periods just great_ but it turned me into an emotional mess (constantly sad_ crying if someone so much as looked at me wrong_ etc).  All the symptoms stopped when I quit taking it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this drug.,M,20,2  months,10/3/2008,Yaz
221, 1, Endometriosis,Meniere's disease_ vision prescription change,I had been taking Yaz for only 1.5 weeks when I developed a roaring_ ringing_ echoing_ and fullness sensation in my left ear with extreme sensitivity to sound. After stopping the pill and spending two mornings incapacitated in bed with vertigo_ a week passed and my symptoms declined right before I started my period. I saw an ENT approx 1 week from when my symptoms started and was diagnosed with Meniere's disease_ a build up of pressure/fluids in the inner ear_ probably caused by Yaz. During this time_ I started getting eye strain so I went in to get my eyes rechecked (yearly exam was in August) and my astigmatism had changed for the first time in 3 years in BOTH eyes! Yaz is an awful_ awful drug.,F,31,10  days,9/20/2008,Yaz
222, 3, Perimenopausal mood swings,Breakthrough bleeding for two full weeks before my period_ very annoying,It was a great help with my mood swings.,F,44,5  months,9/13/2008,Yaz
223, 4, pregnancy prevention,darkened skin under lip,I was on this pill twice for app. a year each time_ with a year off in between. Good things were light (and short) periods_ no cramps_ no depression like other pills have given me. Bad things included frequent yeast infections and this dark spot on my lip that looked like a 5 o'clock shadow. It got to the point where I waxed it every 3-4 days thinking it was hair_ but it wasn't. The dark shadow always remained_ and makeup only made it look worse. I discussed it with my doctor and he said this pill was possibly too strong for me. He switched me to Mircette without explaining why it would be better for me (other than that it was lighter)_ so I ended up on this site researching others' opinions on it........needless to say it sounds horrible_ and I'm now wondering if I'm better off walking around with an optical illusion of a mustache instead!,F,28,2  years,9/10/2008,Yaz
224, 4, Help balance out my hormones,Some cramping the last week before the placebo week. Get pretty bloated during my period. Keeps my skin clear.,Periods are almost non-existant. I don't have to use regular pad or tampons anymore. Pantylines are more than enough. I don't get my period until I finish the placebo pills...I get it the first week of the next pack.,F,31,4  months,9/7/2008,Yaz
225, 5, Prevent pregnancy,I had breakthrough bleeding towards the end of my first pack of pills_ and nothing since then.,"I thought my breasts were getting a little fuller_ but that may have gone away_ and I'm very small to begin with anyways.  It's supposed to help your face clear up and make your periods lighter.  However_ for me_ my face didn't really clear up all the way_ but has gotten better.  Periods fluctuate_ some I don't feel any cramps and it comes as a ""surprise"" (a good one though :))_ and others I get a little crampy_ but they're better than the other bc's I've taken - nordette and levora.",F,25,4  months,8/28/2008,Yaz
