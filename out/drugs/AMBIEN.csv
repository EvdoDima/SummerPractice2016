7, 1, KILLED sister due to sleep driving,Cooking_ making phone calls_ online purchases_ etc...with no memory of the event. Orders would arrive at her door and people would tell her about conversations they had with her. She was addressing these issues but sadly it ended with sleep driving on a familiar highway traveling North in the South bound lane hitting a car head on. Sleep driving is one of the side effects which is insane_ I don't even take it but fear for my life now because of the drivers who do.  I would bet the young woman my sister hit that is now disabled for life would agree this should be taken off the market.,,F,26,1  years,1/25/2016,Ambien

10, 5, Severe pain wakes me up at night,None,We just started with a brand new PA fresh out of school. She said she would not do an RX for over 5mg and 30 days at my age (65). Quality of life is more important to me and has been to my other Dr's in other states. (We worked for the government). I have MS_ Osteoporosis_ Arthritis mid back_ lower back_ and spinal injuries_ problems_ from C-5 down. I have excruciating pain_ and even break thru Ambien 10mg_ but it is what it is. I've never had any of my more experienced Dr's say anything about my dose. They know what I'm going thru. At least I've been getting five hours of much needed sleep since starting this med. Any contraindication_ that says its so dangerous? I've used it without any problems for a few years. Occasionally skipping it if I'm lucky. Thanks,,,1  years10,12/22/2015,Ambien

13, 2, Insomnia,Ambien certainly puts you to sleep. In my case_ it gave me a terrible hangover. I seem to be in a minority of people that get this side effect. It makes me really cloudy and even depressed. I feel as if it works on the same pathway that gives you your liveliness_ by dampening it. I also found that I built a psychological dependency on it. I would get some anxiety about  not going to sleep without taking it. All in all_ if you can avoid taking one of these classes of drugs_ I'd highly recommend doing so.,,M,31, 5 mg 1X D,11/2/2015Email,Ambien
14, 5, chronic pain causing sleep deprivat,Ambien makes me sleepy and takes away a substantial amount of pain so that I can sleep_ at least more than half of the night.,This medicine has changed the quality of my life. Before using it_ after a car accident_ I was in too much pain to sleep. Opioids interrupt sleep patterns and do not take away enough pain. Ambien takes some of the pain away_ as well as making me sleepy. Ambien's effects seem to be a little like the effects of alcohol_ such as lowered inhibitions. It takes a couple of years to adjust to that. Reading another user's review here helps to confirm that it does that. If a person is psychotic then their psychosis will increase. If a person is normal and happy_ they get happier. No financial decisions should be made while in the adjustment phase of taking Ambien. I hope that the pharmaceutical companies will do further research on Ambien's ability to alleviate pain.,F,53,5  years10 mg 1X D,10/30/2015,Ambien

Was prescribed Ambien to overcome the insomnia. Only used it for about 2 weeks. It got me back on track. It allowed me just 6 hours of sleep per night - no more_ no less - but it was a life saver.

Believing that being on this drug for so many years may have changed my brain in some way.  I still have conversations with my husband_ eat_ have sex_ etc. and have absolutely NO memory of it in the morning.  I thought it was helping me in the past_ but it has effected me in a way that still causes me problems 5 years after my last pill.

28, 5, Chronic insomnia,Nighttime eating,True insomniacs know one of the worst kinds of pain there is.  (Read William Styron's book Darkness Visible.)Thanks to this drug_ I have been able to enjoy a long healthy life as a professor and many other blessings.  What is this about taking a sleep medication_ then--deliberately--going out on the street? Avoid food for at least two hours before you take the pill_ then get into bed immediately and stay there.  Do not drink alcohol!  (Seriously.)This is in some ways a challenging med--it's essential to follow the instructions to the letter. I set a little plate of cheese on the nightstand_ because_ for me_ the no-inhibitions_ glowing_ hungry moment sets in after about forty minutes. I put the TV on sleep mode_ keep a few bottles of water next to the bed_ watch something relaxing_ and turn off the lights.  Not once have I had a nightmare; I'm full of energy_ and grateful beyond words that I didn't have to suffer with this condition a century ago.Please don't ruin this for those of us who are not able to treat Ambien as a hobby.,F,70,10  years12.5,6/3/2015,Ambien

37, 5, Insomnia,Hallucinations and memory loss if I stayed up on it,I love_ love_ love this drug. I suffered from severe insomnia and this was the only drug I had that made me fall asleep so fast that I didn't even remember laying down for more than 10 minutes. I would wake up feeling refreshed and re-charged for my day with no lingering side effects or grogginess. However_ I HAD to get in bed once I took it. I stayed up one night reading a book_ and let's just say that was not all I ended up doing. I apparently went to the store for junk food_ ate the junk food_ purchased things online_ made some embarrassing Facebook posts_ and texted my friends at 4am. I had NO memory of it. One night I stayed up just a little later on it and hallucinated that fairies were coming down from the ceiling. It was not unpleasant_ however. And if I was woken up on it without 8 hours elapsing from the time I took it_ I would say and do things I had no memory of. I was woken up for an emergency once after 4 hours of sleep and apparently told my sister I liked ice cream and we should make cookies...at 3am. I also had to go to the hospital that night and had no memory of the experience the next day. But when I take it and go to sleep_ it works perfectly.,M,29,5  months10MG 1X D,12/17/2014Email,Ambien
