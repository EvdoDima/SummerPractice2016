7, 1, KILLED sister due to sleep driving,Cooking_ making phone calls_ online purchases_ etc...with no memory of the event. Orders would arrive at her door and people would tell her about conversations they had with her. She was addressing these issues but sadly it ended with sleep driving on a familiar highway traveling North in the South bound lane hitting a car head on. Sleep driving is one of the side effects which is insane_ I don't even take it but fear for my life now because of the drivers who do.  I would bet the young woman my sister hit that is now disabled for life would agree this should be taken off the market.,,F,26,1  years,1/25/2016,Ambien

10, 5, Severe pain wakes me up at night,None,We just started with a brand new PA fresh out of school. She said she would not do an RX for over 5mg and 30 days at my age (65). Quality of life is more important to me and has been to my other Dr's in other states. (We worked for the government). I have MS_ Osteoporosis_ Arthritis mid back_ lower back_ and spinal injuries_ problems_ from C-5 down. I have excruciating pain_ and even break thru Ambien 10mg_ but it is what it is. I've never had any of my more experienced Dr's say anything about my dose. They know what I'm going thru. At least I've been getting five hours of much needed sleep since starting this med. Any contraindication_ that says its so dangerous? I've used it without any problems for a few years. Occasionally skipping it if I'm lucky. Thanks,,,1  years10,12/22/2015,Ambien

13, 2, Insomnia,Ambien certainly puts you to sleep. In my case_ it gave me a terrible hangover. I seem to be in a minority of people that get this side effect. It makes me really cloudy and even depressed. I feel as if it works on the same pathway that gives you your liveliness_ by dampening it. I also found that I built a psychological dependency on it. I would get some anxiety about  not going to sleep without taking it. All in all_ if you can avoid taking one of these classes of drugs_ I'd highly recommend doing so.,,M,31, 5 mg 1X D,11/2/2015Email,Ambien
14, 5, chronic pain causing sleep deprivat,Ambien makes me sleepy and takes away a substantial amount of pain so that I can sleep_ at least more than half of the night.,This medicine has changed the quality of my life. Before using it_ after a car accident_ I was in too much pain to sleep. Opioids interrupt sleep patterns and do not take away enough pain. Ambien takes some of the pain away_ as well as making me sleepy. Ambien's effects seem to be a little like the effects of alcohol_ such as lowered inhibitions. It takes a couple of years to adjust to that. Reading another user's review here helps to confirm that it does that. If a person is psychotic then their psychosis will increase. If a person is normal and happy_ they get happier. No financial decisions should be made while in the adjustment phase of taking Ambien. I hope that the pharmaceutical companies will do further research on Ambien's ability to alleviate pain.,F,53,5  years10 mg 1X D,10/30/2015,Ambien

Believing that being on this drug for so many years may have changed my brain in some way.  I still have conversations with my husband_ eat_ have sex_ etc. and have absolutely NO memory of it in the morning.  I thought it was helping me in the past_ but it has effected me in a way that still causes me problems 5 years after my last pill.

28, 5, Chronic insomnia,Nighttime eating,True insomniacs know one of the worst kinds of pain there is.  (Read William Styron's book Darkness Visible.)Thanks to this drug_ I have been able to enjoy a long healthy life as a professor and many other blessings.  What is this about taking a sleep medication_ then--deliberately--going out on the street? Avoid food for at least two hours before you take the pill_ then get into bed immediately and stay there.  Do not drink alcohol!  (Seriously.)This is in some ways a challenging med--it's essential to follow the instructions to the letter. I set a little plate of cheese on the nightstand_ because_ for me_ the no-inhibitions_ glowing_ hungry moment sets in after about forty minutes. I put the TV on sleep mode_ keep a few bottles of water next to the bed_ watch something relaxing_ and turn off the lights.  Not once have I had a nightmare; I'm full of energy_ and grateful beyond words that I didn't have to suffer with this condition a century ago.Please don't ruin this for those of us who are not able to treat Ambien as a hobby.,F,70,10  years12.5,6/3/2015,Ambien

I suffered from severe insomnia and this was the only drug I had that made me fall asleep so fast that I didn't even remember laying down for more than 10 minutes. I would wake up feeling refreshed and re-charged for my day with no lingering side effects or grogginess. However_ I HAD to get in bed once I took it. I stayed up one night reading a book_ and let's just say that was not all I ended up doing. I apparently went to the store for junk food_ ate the junk food_ purchased things online_ made some embarrassing Facebook posts_ and texted my friends at 4am. I had NO memory of it. One night I stayed up just a little later on it and hallucinated that fairies were coming down from the ceiling. It was not unpleasant_ however. And if I was woken up on it without 8 hours elapsing from the time I took it_ I would say and do things I had no memory of. I was woken up for an emergency once after 4 hours of sleep and apparently told my sister I liked ice cream and we should make cookies...at 3am. I also had to go to the hospital that night and had no memory of the experience the next day. But when I take it and go to sleep_ it works perfectly.,M,29,5  months10MG 1X D,12/17/2014Email,Ambien

Tis pill stops all the pain.,My doctor is currently looking for a similar drug that I can take during the day to help with my pain. I take lyrica and pain meds which I don't really need if I had something like this during the day. Ambien could help many people with nerve damage. I have never had any side effects that you guys have written but I don't read the side effects my family does because a lot of people who read them start having symptoms and I know for me it's been a life saver. I can sleep and have no pain in my feet and if I didn't get that relief who knows where I would be. I just wish I could take this during g the day. I would love a study to be done on me I bet it could help so many with nerve damage.,F,39,12  years10mg 1X D,5/24/2014Email,Ambien

I worked 11p-7a shift went home after a bath took ambien while in the sleepwalking phase I drove to the nail salon got a full set of nails upon waking up and noticing I drove myself while sleeping to the nail salon I reached into my pockets to find $50 worth of scratch off lottery tickets I'd purchased.  I've made meal_ had full blown conversations and did not realize until the next day when someone would recite something we talked about.  The thing that happens a lot is I will take more of the medication while I'm in my sleeping phase and will not know that I did that until the next day.  It's a good medication but it comes with a lot of dangerous side effects. Overall while in the sleep walking phase of ambien I've drove my car to the store_ nail salon_ cooked meals_ had conversations and was sexually active while in the sleep but awake phase of ambien.,,F,41,4  years12.5 1X D,4/25/2014,Ambien

Made me tired in the morning to where I just wanted to sleep but at night it was frustrating to try to sleep if I did not do so 15 min after taking it. This is a bad drug. Hide your phone_ kitchen and car keys! It also made me anxious during day. I finally found chamomile tea that is medical strength and it works better than ambien ever did. I felt like I was just going thru the motions and not engaged in living on this drug. It was awful because I wanted to sleep.

As the years went by I found Ambien to be a ""good friend"" when I needed to get to sleep...until the dangerous and unwanted side effects started to happen...what happens is_ before you actually fall asleep_ you slip into this weird ""twilight"" phase_ when you can start sleep walking and doing things you don't know you are doing. You can talk on the phone_ cook a meal_ go outside and make alot of stupid choices while in this weird frame of mind and not know you are even doing it until you wake up and see the mess you made in the kitchen_ etc. It's like you are operating on autopilot_ making odd_ ""indulgent"" sort of choices like online shopping_ etc.    The big wake up calls started happening then..I would wake up and realize I took many pills all at once..without knowing it. Somewhere down the line_ after entering that ""twilight"" period_ I decided to swallow more pills. Now I finally understand how people can accidentally overdose. Thank god_ I did wake up in the morning and nothing horrible happened. There is also no way to prevent this from happening_ outside of getting one of those timed_ locked pill boxes_ You end up doing things you dont even realize you are doing.The final straw came when_ at some point_ I tripped and fell and broke my nose_ and I woke up with bruising on my face and sore knees.

I decided to come off the pain killers and start using ambien to help me sleep through my chronic pain.  I have never been depressed_ but started to slowly sink into a dark hole.  I would start crying at the drop of a hat. Mornings were the worst. It would start as soon as I woke up and I would get better as the day progressed.

Like most people I would get up in the middle of the night and do random and weird things (mostly sleep eating)_ the difference is I would remember it the next day. While on it_ I noticed that not only was I fatigued throughout the day and my depression worsened_ but it destroyed my teeth. Never needing braces in my life_ my teeth were straight and I was always told that I had a nice smile and then my teeth started chipping and crumbling; literally breaking apart and coming out in pieces while I was eating. I had to have two root canals and two crowns and one tooth extracted_ another broke off at the gum line. I also had to go to a periodontist for root planing because I was at the beginning stages of gum disease. I had never had these problems in my life only when I was on ambien_ now that I have been off it they have subsided_ but a lot of damage has been done. I remember waking up in the morning having to take huge amounts of ibuprofen every few hours because my mouth and jaw were in excruciating pain from all the grinding I would do in my sleep. While I was on it_ if I couldn't get it I would become extremely anxious and freak out_ lashing out at people.

This is the only way I can sleep. That being said_ the major problem is amnesia. I have cooked_ given my kids money_ held conversations and much more_ all the while I appear to be normal and awake. I have no recollection of these activities until my family starts talking about them. Also_ the scariest problem_ I like other users_ have unknowingly taken more pills than prescribed throughout the night. The worst episode_ best I can guess_ is I took 10-15. My husband found me laying on the floor next to the bed_ and I could not walk. I eventually ended up falling twice into furniture_ and again woke up hours later on the floor_ so bruised and battered I looked like I'd been beaten.

98, 4, Insomnia,Hypnotic sedation,I was prescribed this for my insomnia problem which required medical attention. All I can say is it cured my problem of not being able to fall asleep like a charm. But I soon noticed that if I took it and stayed up on it_ a very euphoric hypnotic state would set in and I loved how it made me feel. Lights looked brighter_ objects appeared differently_ and I would sometimes catch myself glancing at my reflection in the bathroom mirror after using the restroom and notice my reflection looking different to me. I once slept in my old bedroom at my parents' house and it had those glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling_ and while looking up at them I saw them swirling all over the place and moving about. It was obviously a hallucination. I began wanting to take the drug even on nights I didn't need it because this hypnotic state was so relaxing. I soon realized how dangerous this was and asked my doctor to discontinue it (despite its sleep benefits) and put me on something else.

111, 2, Sleep,"This medication is a hypnotic agent_ meaning it induces a state of amnesia. I took Ambien for two years because I could not fall asleep at night. It did help me fall asleep. However I NEVER felt rested the next day. I just couldn't figure out why I was SO incredibly tired all the time because I always thought I got a restful night's sleep. HERE'S AMBIEN'S DIRTY SECRET: Because this med is a hypnotic_ you ""feel"" like you got good sleep because your brain literally doesn't remember - IT INDUCES AMNESIA- You end up assuming you got good sleep because you FORGET in the AM that you didn't! I have stopped taking it after two years of nightly use and replaced with a Melatonin/5-HTP supplement for the past 3 days. I HAVE NEVER felt so rested! I can tell such a difference.

I was never a fan of Ambien but every 9 months or so I would take it for 2 weeks.  2 years ago_ I had an amnesiac episode where evidently in the middle of the night I took 10 pills.  I did not realize I did this for three days and suffered through the most horrendous anxiety that really made me understand why people kill themselves.  I found out what had happened and was able to go into my local hospital for a few days to be treated and calm down.  I always took the med responsibly. I would go right to bed.  Everyone needs to be aware that even if you have never had an issue before_ it does not mean this can not happen to you.

I have found however that if you take 1/2 pill you will sleep all night versus when I take a whole pill I wake up about 4 hours later.  SO...  1/2 pill works great for sleep!,I have been taking this drug for many years and have found that 1/2 pill works better than 1 whole pill to sleep ALL night.

123, 5, Insomnia,Hunger in the middle of the night (not sleep-eating_ I knew what I was doing) and hallucinations if I didn't go to bed right away,I was having a pretty bad bout of insomnia and finally decided I needed to see the doctor about it. When I heard he was giving me Ambien_ I freaked out. I had heard many scary things about it from other users. I was terrified to take it_ but I figured not sleeping was worse_ so I tried it. I slept so well that night. I didn't even remember drifting off. I felt so rested. I would notice that if I took it and stayed up doing anything_ like reading_ I would eventually start seeing things. One night the lights in my house looked like they were moving around and floating through the room_ like orbs. It never scared me_ though_ because I knew it was the Ambien doing it and I was the one stupid enough to stay up after taking it when the label said to take it right when going to sleep. I also noticed that if I happened to wake up some nights_ I'd get intense urges to eat anything crunchy_ like cereals. But the sleep I got was so good. Eventually_ the 10 MG I was taking started to poop out on me around the three month mark. My doctor did not want to increase my dosage any higher_ so he just discontinued the Ambien altogether and put me on Lunesta_ which was way more expensive. I was worried about stopping the Ambien cold turkey after three months and he said it shouldn't be a problem.

Took 5 mg/night for a few months_ then cut back to 2.5_ which I've been taking ever since.  I only take 5 mg now if I'm having a really rough time falling asleep.  The only downside to the drug (that others have talked about extensively)_ is that it's hard to get off it.  I've been on it for five years_ and just about every time I try to stop taking it_ I have a rough night or two and end up getting right back on it.

Drs found I had borderline apnea_ not bad enough to get a cpap or do anything else.  Dr prescribed ambien.  Worked great for about a week_ then the side effects started in.  I had had chronic depression as a teenager_ this was worse.  I started planning my suicide_ and started cutting myself_ which I had not done in 20 years.  I drove away my wife and several friends_ and ruined my job by not doing pretty much anything useful for a month.  Fortunately a friend with her own history of depression recognized what was going on_ helped me to see it and got me off the meds.  A few days later I was mostly back to normal_ and set about repairing the relationships I damaged.  Unfortunately it was too late to fix my job and I ended up being let go.

As with all sleep meds you will develop a tolerance if you take it on a regular basis. Go to bed immediately after taking ambien for it to work properly.

162, 1, Insomnia,Anxiety_ addiction_ tolerence_ pain in side_ and many more,Ambien nearly ruined my life - I am very lucky that I overcame this drug and I hope to help educate others about the dangers.   I became very addicted to this drug - not for a high or euphoria - but simply to sleep.  If you do some research - you will see that it is HIGHLY addictive.   Be very_ very careful before you start taking this.  If you use it for occasional insomnia you are fine - but many find themselves taking it more and more often until you are hooked.   It is terrible getting off of it too.  I spent 6 weeks in rehab to get better as did many others (many celebrities have gone to rehab for Ambien).  Please don't take this medication for your own sake.   Be very_ very careful and do your research.

I didn't go out of my way to fix the mix up_ therefor indicating I am not addicted.  During the month of not taking any_ I DID have severe insomnia like before starting Ambien. -------------While taking the drug... sometimes at night I get up_ eat_ play on the pc for a few... but I remember all of it_ just not as clearly as usual.

There are so many horror stories here about getting off Ambien and I wanted to offer some hope. I'm on day 3 off it. The first night I did not sleep at all. The first 2 days I had all the usual withdrawal symptoms. I was ready to go to the ER. I actually slept last night and on day 3_ today_ I'm feeling almost normal.

168, 1, Insomnia,anxiety_ depression_ confusion.,"I posted my rating in May and wanted to reiterate it again_  I have chronic insomnia so I have cycled through every sleep aid.  When I was on a cycle of ambien in May_ I had discovered three days later that I took ten pills at once three nights prior and could not figure out why my anxiety was through the roof.  Fortunately I was able to go into my local hospital for ""detox"" since I was so freaked out about it. You can go back and read the experience_ it is from May.  I know all drugs affect peopel differently so I will not preach.  IMO_ I feel that Ambien is  the most toxic horrific drug I have ever had.  I never really liked it and would use it for a 2 week cycle every 6 months or so.  I started to put 2 and 2 together and realized how much it affected my anxiety and depression in general.  I have a friend who is in detox now from ambien abuse.  She was taking 4-5 a day.   Needless to say I have not touched one since May and would never touch another one again.  It is insidious. You may think you are ok and it doesn't affect you negatively but this drug changes you in ways you can not imagine.  I am thankful that I never have to see this med ever again.

For me it has been the first time in my life that I am able to fall asleep within 15 minutes or so and wake up feeling rested.  I don't think I ever knew what that meant before_ 'feeling rested.'   I also have ADD and take Celexa (an SSRI)  daily.   I tried the over the counter sleep medications but always felt grogy in the morning. With Ambien I don't.  But I found half a tablet will do the trick.  I have taken a full tablet when I felt I really needed a good solid 8 hours of sleep.  Last night I took a full tablet. This morning my husband said I did some things sexually last night that he has never seen me do.  So I looked online and found that others have experienced this also.  He called it total inhabition.  He thought it was pretty amusing.  I certainly didn't for I don't remember any of it.  In reading other side affects it does become a bit scary.  So just wanted to say that it is a possible side effect.,F,58, 10mg 1X D,1/8/2012,Ambien

Problem was during the 5 hours I thought I was asleep I got up and behaved in a crazy manner of which I have zero recollection. The next day I was told I would never be invited back.  I thought they were joking because again I had no memory of anything but going to bed. On another occasion sent crazy emails to work people. Clearly this medication is not for me and I will never take it again.  In talking with colleagues at work who have taken it I have heard other bad stories.

I was only sleeping for an average of 4 to 5 hours of sleep at night before I started taking the Zolpidem 10mg (Ambien). I am a healthy young man with no previous history of mental health issues but once I started taking Ambien_ I developed severe depression and anxiety. I went to college and obtained my bachelor's degree so I am an ambitious person who loves life. However_ all that changed after I started taking Ambien. I had taken some samples before I started taking it for 4 months and only had hallucinations when I took it on and off over the span of a few months. I never experienced severe side effects when I was taking it once in a while. However_ once I got a full prescription for a long period of time_ I started to develop psychological problems.

(Admittedly_ there are times when a glass of wine helps.)  But recently I stopped the drug for 6 weeks and_ while I barely slept_ I was much more alert during the day.  When I resumed Ambien the drowsiness recurred.  I've been complaining to my doctor for years about being tired all the time.  Now I know why.

I take this at night and when I wake up in the morning I feel so refreshed_ not tired at all and ready for my 12 hour day shift! I have never experienced anything other than mild hallucinations on this drug_ but I don't mind it one bit because it only means it's working and it's also my clue to hit the sack.  I can see how one would become mentally addicted to this but not physically!  I have never experienced any kind of withdrawals and I have taken this for weeks on and off.  It sounds like to me that some people are abusing it though_ obviously that is going to cause you to have some issues.  You can also build a tolerance to it fairly quickly so it is important to not take it every single day.

189, 5, Trouble falling & staying asleep,amnesia_ decreased inhibitions,"My issue with sleep before Ambien was ""my mind wouldn't shut off.""  I would review the day over and over.  I would get up to write reminders down several times a night.  I also needed to have a movie playing in order to fall asleep.  Nights without Ambien_ Id stay up until 3am.  Recently_ I was diagnosed with ADD and am now taking Adderall as well as Ambien.  THAT has made a significant difference because it calms my mind throughout the day_ and it stays calm until bedtime.  I still need Ambien most nights because I dont feel tired enough at bedtime_ but the nights without it are not nearly as severe.  I think the effects depend on the person  it really affects me much the same as alcohol would_ and I dont mind it.  I dont remember the sexual activity until my husband brings it up the next morning_ then its a little hazy_ but while its happening_ I dont have any problems with it and remember just feeling very impulsive and turned on.  BECAUSE Im very happily married_ I think the effects are not a bad thing for me.  I highly recommend this medication IF you have a responsible partner/roommate that you can depend on to prevent you from making bad decisions while on it and would NOT take it if you tend to react negatively to being intoxicated.  The Ambien does its job very well for me  I tend to fall asleep within 15 minutes of lying down and have not had to have a movie playing or gotten up to write",F,37,3  years10 mg 1X D,7/27/2011Email,Ambien

My husband just told me I've been having wild hot monkey sex with him during several Ambien-fueled trances.  I wondered why I was waking up all sore_ with wild clothing strewn about the house_ and have a chronic bladder infection.  I believe this only happens_ not on the Tues/Thurs I take it_ but on a Saturday when I combine it with alcohol.

I find it does a very good job of getting me asleep and keeping me asleep. Typically_ I fall asleep about 1/2 hour after taking and sleep almost exactly 7 hours before waking. My biggest problem with the stuff is the nausea it is causing me the following day. Sometimes I feel like I am going to vomit almost all day long.

The best sleep I get is to take 5mg when I go to bed and the other 5mg 2 to 4 hours later when I wake up again.

I discovered that I took the 10 pills three days into this intense anxiety. I was terrified but relieved that this was the reason.  I checked into the hospital for 4 days for detox and monitoring.  I am lucky I have good insurance.  Once the ambien worked out of my system_ the anxiety/depressive state dissipated greatly.  I am 10 days off it and I will never take this poison again.

I've seen much worse withdrawal with relatives going off opiate based meds.  My doc has advised me to stay on the Ambien and treat the BP.... I'm thinking about it.

I did not relate it to ambien and my dr. prescribed diazepam for anxiety.  This worked for a while.  Recently the ambien stopped working so well and I began having dizzy spells.  I think my body was screaming for more ambien!  I started having alarming noise in my head when I was falling asleep that seemed like electrical zaps. Some days I was dizzy and felt like I was just in a fog. Then one morning I got up and found evidence that I had been up eating peanut butter during the night.  Had to be me since my husband hates peanut butter. That was the last straw.  I stopped the ambien and have been tapering off with diazepam at night.  I will soon be off of both for good! I never thought this could happen to me.  I really wonder what else I have done at night that I can't remember.

I was told what I had done the next day since I have NO memory of any of it. In my mind I don't think it happened.  I literally cannot remember anything.  That is a very uncomfortable feeling. I obviously woke up and got in my car and along the way drove down an embankment_ tearing through a fence and getting stuck in a field. Had I went left instead of right I would have ended up in a deep slough. ( for some reason all of my windows were down during this and I drive a black car_ I'm certain if I would have went in the water I would have sunk & drowned and no one would see it)  Somehow I got out of the field.  I then proceeded to continue on and drove through someone's yard striking and breaking a ceder tree.  The police were called and they gave me a field sobriety test_ didn't pass_ was handcuffed and taken to jail and booked.  I was wearing my pajamas and slippers.  This has scared me to death and I threw away my one pill shy of a full prescription.  I won't be taking this ever again and I am looking into filing a lawsuit for the maker of this medication.  I've read far too many stories since this happened to me and even worse_ DEATH.  I would urge everyone to think long and hard before taking this medication.

When I ran out_ I took Trazodone 100 mg plus Elavil 40 mg at bedtime.  I have not experienced ANY withdrawal from stopping the Ambien cold turkey.  When I receive my 3 month supply from a mail order pharmacy I will stop the other 2 meds & go back on the Ambien 10 mg at bedtime.  Substituting the Elavil & Trazodone for the Ambien has provided very good sleeping---you may even be able to get by with just the Elavil or just the Trazodone alone.  I am a retired pharmacist.  I plan on going off the Ambien periodically_ for a week or so (substituting with the Elavil & Trazodone_ so I do not build up a tolerance to the Ambien.

207, 3, Insomnia,Decreased recall of early morning events,I don't believe it worked for me like it does for others.  My problem was not that I had difficulty falling asleep_ but rather in staying asleep. I went from 1-2 hours asleep per night to 3-4 hours with ambien.  Although it increased the amount of hours I slept per night_ it was still broken sleep and not a sufficient amount of hours to feel refreshed in the morning.  I then attempted splitting the dosage to 5mg at bedtime and 5mg when I woke at night and most times I did not fall back to sleep with the middle of the night dose. Switching to Ambien CR did not make any difference either. I also noticed that my recall memory of events that took place about a 1/2 hour after waking were diminished.,F,54,2  weeks10 mg 1X D,3/27/2011,Ambien

Try some melatonin and/or 5-HTP - they work great and don't have the side effects.

I also experience horrible_ violent_ vivid nightmares at least 5X a week and ambien is like my ""good dream pill.""  This medication is what finally stopped my fear of going to sleep.

I just switched to klonopin to address the root cause of my sleep disorder (anxiety). This new medication has side effects as well_ they all do. But I prefer to be medicating the core issue rather than a symptom ""twice removed"".  As a caution I would stress that in my experience Ambien made my depressive states longer. Oddly I was correctly diagnosed with Bi-Polar II and believe that the Ambien while keeping me in a more depressed state also PREVENTED manic episodes. Significant memory loss and noticeable diminished cognition. I have always been very sharp mentally. Able to manage lots of information but ambien caused a reduction in that area of my life.

I've been known to talk strangely_ dance around and basically act like your everyday drunk- but I have not sleepwalked_ sleep eaten_ sleep sex or sleep driven. I have not done anything destructive. The first few nights it made me nauseous_ but then it eventually stopped. After awhile the drug doesn't work as well_ so I detox for a couple days and then it starts to work again. I usually remember what I did the night before- I just feel so great and tired that I don't care if I look like a fool. I would definitely recommend this drug to anyone who has problems sleeping.

Take the pill and went to sleep.  Then a big change occurred.  She was not taking it to sleep_ she was just taking it ...and staying awake till 1 - 2 in the morning_ texting_ emailing people she barely knew_ completely irrational. She exchanged 2000 texts in 3 weeks at all hours of the night with someone she have never spoken with.   She became very sexually uninhibited and aggressive and argumentative and often only remembered small amounts of her behavior. She could not go to bed without it.  I eventually realized she was addicted to it and told her as much.  She got very angry at me and then several weeks later called me crying and told me she was addicted.  She has been off it now for 2 months and cannot believe how much and how subtly  this drug affected her behavior and though processes.

This drug works well to put ""vocies"" to sleep and become lethargic also in my own motion. Any attempts to sleep without it are mostly random_ and the dumber part of the brain_ or the brain used while sleeping can't seem to figure out that it is the same voices that bother the me all day_ unless_ and usually once weekly if no sleeping pills are taken it will just override the hacking attempts of voices during sleep cycle to regenerate and even cause a reverse effect where schizo is in a nightmare that I create for them. Still playing games with the bigboys in the larger scale dimension between organized bacteria and individual bacteria or cellular sized organisms of lazy atoms. Taking the ambien_ which is a fine drug_ does a fantastic job and does not seem to cause any reliance without it_ besides the desire to sleep without nightmares_ which was a preexisting condition to taking ambien_ at least for myself.

I also would have conversations that I didn't remember having_ and I became depressed.

The next day I was dizzy and cold and decided I couldn't live through another night like the one I had just had_ so I decided to cut Ambien out gradually_ which I've read you should do anyway. I started out on 10mg_ and each week I've been cutting the dosage in half. This seems to be working out well and I'll be totally off of it in another week.

And then there is the depression and short term memory loss.,This is a wonder drug but I think it is way over prescribed. It is way too easy to get and way too easy to get hooked on. And it was difficult to get off of. If youve been on it for a while and get off of it_ you simply will not sleep. Sleep deprivation is very hard on the human body and the urge to to keep taking the drug is some times overpowering_ but can be the best move youve ever made.

Then by all means_ go ahead.But under the care of a psychiatrist_ I've been on it for 6 years. It has stopped working. I never took more than prescribed or abused it_ I simply stopped sleeping. But if I don't take it every night I experience a withdrawal. I am sweaty_ pukey_ I shake and cry. Tomorrow I will fly to a good facility with a 30 detox and rehab program so that I can be rid of my need for a drug that doesn't work any longer. It's expensive and my husband is disgusted with me. I'm ashamed and sad. Please just do not take very long term. You may end up with what is basically a ""habit"" and it's not a good place to be.",F,33,6  years10 mg 1X D,10/13/2010,Ambien
248, 1, insomnia,memory loss_ sleep driving_ double vision,I was on this medication for about 4 weeks with no problems until week 5.  I took one night after not using it for about a week.  We had been out of town visiting family when I experienced the worst side effect ever!  I had decided to take my 5 yr. old grandson to school so he could show me his classroom and introduce me to his teacher.  Well_  I remember leaving the hotel to go pick him up and my next memory is an officer asking if I was on any new medication that would make me drowsy.  My grandson had been with me in the car and I had driven to the school and couldn't remember any of it.  The officer called my husband at the hotel and had him pick me up.  I was lucky it was a small town and I had a very understanding officer who didn't file any report. I could have been charged since there was evidence that I had hit something and there was scratches on my vehicle.  I have no memory of most of the day. It scares the heck out of me to think of what could have happened!Don't let your doctor tell you that this medication can not cause these side  effect!

An hour later I took an Ambien. Went to bed. Or so I thought. Ended up driving to my fiance's house and had butt sex with him. Something I find gross and nasty. Plus we did it outside. I do not remember anything. He told me I was really acting weird and saying stupid crap...screwed him and left.I have found huge piles of wrappers on my floor from food I clearly must have eaten in my sleep. Crumbs on my face and in my bed.I also called my dad who is in his 90s and asked him if he wanted to be in a rock band with me. I do not remember this. My mom yelled at me the next day.Had horrible bouts of depression during the day after taking it to the point of profuse despair unlike any other time. Not every day I took it  but sometimes. Addicts be warned: it makes you trip,Ambien needs to give a free bedside seatbelt to keep it's consumers from getting up and doing things that could SERIOUSLY hurt someone.

I would settle for being able to sleep the night full through.  before last night_ I had sleept 4 hours in 2 days as it takes 4 hours for Ambien to wear out.... I topped todays 20mg Ambien with a Trazadonee and a Temazepam.  Hopefully_ I will see sleep before work starts in 7 hours...,Ambien works so long as you take time off from it.

My doctor prescribed this for insomnia and told me it was very safe to take nightly.   To make a long story short_ I just returned from 60 days of inpatient rehab to get off the stuff.  I did not take it to get high_ but rather to sleep.  After awhile_ your body becomes addicted and YOU CAN NOT SLEEP WITHOUT IT.

I had also had and episode where I scared the hell out of a guy I was dating when he stayed over_ and he said I went crazy. I was upset with him before I took the Ambien. I kinda remember crying (maybe a little)_ but he said I was crying uncontrollably_ and yelling. I had no memory of all that he said. Lastly...I took one last week and was freaked out when I realized that I had given myself an injection while asleep. I found a bent needle on my night stand_ and cotton balls (as well as alcohol pads) in my bed. That night I thought about doing it_ but decided since it was late to wait until the morning.,There was a long gap before I took that last dosage. Instead of already being in the bed when I took it_ my last memory was standing in front of my dresser looking in the mirror. Right now...I'm not sure if my being already being in bed would of made a difference.

I sometimes don't remember conversations if in middle of night (if my husband tells me something after I'm already asleep). Overall_ great med. I take it a few nights a week.

265, 2, Insomia,Daytime grogginess_ rebound insomnia_ and strange behavior,I actually haven't taken Ambien in a while but wanted to post my experience.  I did not have as severe symptoms as some described here_ but I found that my side effects greatly outweighed any benefits.  Even if I got 8 hours of sleep_ I would be very groggy the next day_ which was very difficult when I had to drive a distance the next day.  Also_ while I could sleep the night I took it_ I couldn't the next night.  The medicine would take about 30 minutes to kick in_ but_ when it did_ I would do some pretty silly things like send messages to my sister in all caps_ a desire to put on all this make-up though I don't really wear any usually_ and it made me want to have sex really_ really bad.  I remember thinking that these behaviors were really strange and not me while I was doing them_ but I just couldn't stop.  My doctor has tried to put me back on Zoloft several times_ but I refuse.  If I really_ really need something_ I just take a benadryl.  That still makes me a bit groggy the next day_ but nothing like Ambien.,F,35, 10 1X AN,9/8/2010,Ambien
266, 1, Insomnia,The first few days were fine.  I had done quite a bit of research on Ambien and knew that before taking it_ I needed to lock my door_ hide my car keys_ turn off my phone_ unplug my computer_ and go right to bed.  I also told everyone I live/stay with that I was on the drug and what could happen in regards to side effects.  This past Sunday_ I had a period of about half an hour in the middle of the day where I started getting double vision and hallucinations...while driving.  Luckily my girlfriend was with me and was able to drive us home when I explained to her what was going on.  Sunday night I took 1/2 10mg pill to go to sleep_ counted the pills_ and had 6 1/2 left  I was fine.  Got up at 10:00AM Monday.  Around 2PM we went up to a local fast food place for a snack.  I was perfectly aware of everything until we got to the drive thru speaker.  All of a sudden I got very confused.  I don't remember ordering_ I don't remember paying.  I don't remember anything until 4:30PM when I woke u,I thought it would answer my questions_ since melatonin and various other natural and over-the-counter products do nothing.  I do have to say that for the first time in a long time I actually had vivid dreams that I remember completely.  But are they real or induced?

I cannot remember anything that happens right before I go to bed. I do not remember conversations and on one occasion my husband said we had sex and I did not remember. I also have crazy_ vivid and realistic dreams. Otherwise I love the way I sleep! No other physical side effects here. I just come up with crazy scenarios and talk jibberish or I forget to get dressed before going downstairs to have a snack. My hubby catches me in the act all the time and makes sure I am clothed and decent. I do not take ambien when I am here by myself_ almost makes me feel invincible like I can do things that I unrealistically cannot. It can be scary.,For what the drug is_ I feel it works well and helps me sleep well too. It does make my head feel funny but only until I go to sleep.

My doctor told me she would only pprescribe it for a year at a time...and that during that  year_ I should be developing habits and routines that would help me sleep. When I did as she asked...I finished the year and merged into several years of effective sleep_ using my strict nitely routine of a bath_ reading_ quiet time. When I stopped with that...I gradually got back to the state I'm in now_ exhausted and stressed. I have an appointment today to get back on the Ambien CR until I can restore my sleep pattern_ but this time_ I will heed my Doctor's advice_ and once I get into a rythym_ will keep with it_ so that I do not take this drug long-term...I think that is the key.,M,46,1  years10 MG 1X D,8/19/2010Email,Ambien

I never asked my doctor for anything because I thought nothing would work. Finally I asked my doctor and he prescribed me Ambien 10 m.g. It is The Miracle Pill. Ambien works great. I fall asleep instantly as I only take it just before going to bed. I sleep all night and get a good/great night's sleep. I feel great in the morning with no side effects. I'm sorry to hear about the horrible side effects some people are having because I do not experience any of them. Maybe it's because I'm using the drug properly and as prescribed. I don't know.

From the very beginning it was a nightmare.A friend called to check on me one day_claiming I had called her the night before from my truck.And she told me that in the course of our conversation_started shouting that there was a monkey on the hood of my truck reaching in and trying to grab a hat off of my dash.She said I was fighting him.And that the small stuffed turtle decorations sitting on my dash were yelling for me to kick the monkeys butt!! A few days later a friend called checking in saying I had text her some very sexual things a day earlier. This was a older christian lady.I highly respected. If not for the fact that the text were still on my phone_I would never have believed her.The last straw was when my wife said I was lying in bed beside her screaming that I was falling and to catch me before I fell out of the bed.

280, 4, Insomnia - waking too early,More uninhibited sex life.  TERRIBLE midnight eating.  HORRIBLE midnight cooking of nonsensical foods if I'd had any alcohol.  Ranting_ emotional outbursts on text and email. And finally_ rebound insomnia bad enough to get me off this devil's brew!,"At first-- it was a miracle.  Sleeping more than 5 hours with no ""wake up"" was perfect and I was a much ""better"" mother to my children_ and more fun to be around because I would have slept. Then_ 5 years ago_ the uncontrollable midnight eating started.  Every single night.  Hotel mini-bars --- LOOK OUT!  You'd be emptied.  That was followed by cooking the most insane_ gross foods if I'd had alcohol within an hour or so.  Texting and calling and emailing with misspellings_ and saying silly_ overly emotional things to people whom I normally would not ""cross that line"". A year ago_ rebound insomnia started.  I realized_ ""Why the hell would I continue on this drug when I get the same effects OFF the drug?"" Notice bad memory problems creeping in.  Self loathing for the addiction to a drug set in_ as well.  So_ I fired up my meditation CDs_ got a low dose bottle of Melatonin (which makes me too groggy and weird-feeling_ even at a low dose) and decided to start exhausting myself_ aka_ exercise.  Wish me luck.  Cold turkey when last dose ran out and I couldn't get a refill in time.  So far_ more than SO GOOD.  If I can get off_ anyone can.

I am a 240 lb. male who at 48 years old went from the best sleeper I know_ to the worst in about six months.

Loss of inhibition (sex with husband occasionally that is apparently awesome but sometimes not remembered)_ waking up and eating- this happens frequently.  Usually things that I don't remember immediately will come to me later in the morning.  I also watch my DVR shows in bed sometimes then watch them again during the day because I don't remember what the show was about.  But_ if taken properly and with some expectation that these things can happen you can prevent dangerous outcomes.  Let your friends and family know not to pay attention to emails and facebook posts after 11_ make sure you already have a yummy snack or leftovers convenient to grab so you don't cook or trash your kitchen etc. if you do that it helps with the anxiety of not being sure if you can trust yourself.,,M,37,2  years10mg 1X D,7/9/2010Email,Ambien

I was hesitant since I was pregnant but she said the baby would be fine. I was finally able to get a good night's sleep. After I gave birth to my son_ the insomnia was still there but I had already stopped taking them a week before I delivered. Four days after I had him_ I was still awake no matter what time I went to bed. My doctor advised me to take Ambien again even though I was breastfeeding_ it wouldn't affect the baby. Well_ after being awake for four days_ I was at ease. I am now taking Ambien again because within the past week I have been having bouts of insomnia again.

I started down a path of heavy drinking to try to knock myself out_ it was getting ugly. And my family doctor was reluctant to prescibe this drug.

I thought the delerium and hallucinations were bad when he didn't sleep_ but the ambien makes it so much worse.  He still doesn't sleep regularly_ is up and down_ and when he doesn't sleep he is so detatched and confused he has started 3 fires in the house_ tried to walk down the street at 3am_ etc.  This is a horrible drug_ and incredibly dangerous.  I know it works well for some people_ and it did for him in the beginning_ but I don't think it should ever be used long term.  After a recent increase in sleepwalking_ confusion and memory loss_ his doctor has finally taken him off ambien.  After testing with a heart doctor_ the doctor may look at some non-conventional drugs for sleep_ but none of the sleeping pills seem to work for him.  I sympathise with anyone dealing with insomnia_ but especially for those living with someone with insomnia - sometimes I think I'm going crazy just from dealing with him.  I really hope anyone using ambien has someone living with them that can alert them if they start showing any of these symptoms_ otherwise the dangers can be incredibly high.

295, 5, Insomnia,Memory issues.,"I am honest enough to admit that this drug scares me. But it's also the only thing that has helped me to sleep.  One of my earliest memories was laying awake not sleeping and as I entered my 40's it started to take it's toll.  The memory issues occur when I take the pill and do something before going to bed.  I know I should not do that but since it takes a while to work_ it's hard to not ""use"" that time.  The key is that after I see what I did after taking the pill (like seeing that I'd gone in and cleaned up in the kitchen) then I remember doing it.  So the memory is not totally lost_ just masked by the drug.  At this time I have made a decision to accept this since it has been so helpful in keeping my life together.  I need sleep.

The first night I took it_ it worked great and I slept 8 hours.  The next night I slept 6.  The third night I slept 2 hours and was a zombie the next day.  After taking it off and on for three weeks_ I decided to try Melatonin since it is non-addictive.  The Ambien gave me terrible anxiety and horrible night mares.  I had not had night mares in years_ so it was definitely the Ambien.  It took me a couple of weeks for it to completely be out of my system.  I now use Melatonin Spray_ Simalisin homeopathic sleep aid_ and Vitamin B5 to sleep.  No nightmares or grogginess the next day and no addiction.,F,49,21  days10 mg 1X D,6/23/2010,Ambien

My physician was very firm in her instructions to not take the pill until physically getting into bed.  I do and sleep great and finally wake up feeling rested (and at an early hour).  I have had chronic depression/panic disorder for almost 15 years and this drug along with my other meds have given me my life back in a way better way.  Ambien is a sleeping pill people.  Unless you sleep standing up_ don't take it and walk around_ etc.  If used correctly (like any other drug) it is a perfectly safe drug.

298, 1, chronic insomnia,There is help to allow you to sleep and IT IS NOT AMBIEN.  I posted some months ago that this is the devil's drug and a portal to hell - and I still believe that.,"First_ the help that is out there is Seroquel and can be prescribed by your doctor.  It does not make you ""high"" (for those that are addicted or pre-disposed to get a high_ you won't like it).  My experience with Ambien almost ruined my marriage and my life.  I went off cold turkey and of course suffered the consequences of a racing heart and lack of any sleep.  My doctor (God bless him) prescribed me Seroquel and I am out in 15 or 20 minutes and sleep through the night uninterrupted (I can be awakened if needed and function properly_ though a little tired).  It is actually a drug to treat bipolar disorder - I am guessing the manic side of the disease...  Anyway_ I wanted to share this to anyone that suffers the hell of insomnia and is looking to an alternative.  For me_ there is absolutely no Ambien-type effects and while groggy for the first 10 minutes or so in the morning_ the rest of my day is beautiful.  ALL drugs manipulate our brains and like many_ I wish I could get by without them.  Seroquel for sleep is as close to sanity and peace that I have experienced in a long time. God bless those suffering from addictions and from the crazy games our brains can play on us - includin not letting us sleep.  Keep trying - there is help and after YEARS of hell_ I found it.  I hope you do too.  And PS:  Those of you that claim to take Ambien without any side effects at all and call the rest of us addicts...well....maybe rethink your motives of belittling others.",F,46,1  days5 mg 1X D,6/21/2010Email,Ambien

The first weeks were great.  I fell asleep within 15 minutes.  Since then_ there are nights I take it and it doesn't work.  I usually only get 4-5 hours of sleep out of it_ but for me_ any hours that are consecutive_ are worth it.  I recently had surgery and was on pain medication_ so I went two months without my Ambien and I didn't crave it.  I have no fear of addiction.  And those conversations I don't remember are usually with the spouse and he's used to it.

301, 4, Was diagnosed with Graves Disease i,"At first there was always a circus in my bedroom.  I thought it was funny_ until the animals started talking to me and I started talking back to them.

And like any good highly addicting substance_ all the wreckage that goes along with it. Strain on family_ destroyed relationships_ job loss_ etc etc. This is perhaps the most insidious drug on the market today for one reason. Opiates_ benzodiazepenes_ tranquilizers_ you do -NOT- see commercials for on TV because there deleterious effects are well documented. Not so with Ambien though a growing body of evidence is starting to develop rapidly. The drug is horrifically addicting and like many here I found my dosage going up and up_ and the physical addiction became inescapable in very short order. 6 years of my life were taken from me_ and after lots of time around recovery people and a rehab I found out this drug is -quite- common in addiction circles. I absolutely do not doubt any of the horror stories I have read here because I lived many of them personally. The medication makes a truckload of money for Sanofi-Aventis so it is well worth their effort to sweep most of this under the collective rug.

I wake too early (terminal insomnia) and am early perimenopausal but the ambien helps me to get at least 6 to 6 1/2 hours sleep. Can't take Ambien CR or the full 10mg Ambien as it causes lingering grogginess the next day. I think that adjusting the dosage and not taking the full 10 mg. greatly reduces adverse events/effects/addiction. I have taken Ambien off and on for 5 years and am not addicted.

I've played around with the dosage to see which dosage suits me.  For some_ the drug may be too much in the regular prescribed dosage.  I started taking ambien cr 12.5 mg_ which really knocked me out_ and gave me a drowsy all-day feeling the next day. Like some who posted on this site_ I did have a negative effect- (the drowsiness while driving) I did get a ticket for those red light cameras_ and considered stopping taking it_ but then I wanted to see how I would be on a smaller dosage.  I tried a half dose_ and it was still much.  My doctor prescribed 5mg for me_ and I took it for a while_ now I've settled on half of the pill (2.5 mg) which is just right.  I need to take it around 10:00pm_ read or do relaxing things 'til around 11:15 or 11:30pm.  I get a good night's rest and wake up refreshed at anywhere from 6 to7:30am which is when my alarm rings. I do recommend also not operating a motorized vehicle until you find the dosage that's right for you because yes_ you can get drowsy_ and get into accidents.  People are all so different_ we all have different body chemistries so there is no uniform effect.

325, 1, Insomnia,If severe addiction_ divorce_ unemployment_ jail_ getting mortally wounded or dying isn't a problem for you_ then go ahead and take this drug otherwise DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.,People have said go straight to bed after taking this drug. I did_ but then unbeknownst to me (at least the conscious me) I got up and drove my car. I did that three times and I was lucky all the accidents were non fatal (I didn't get a DUI_ kill someone or get killed) although they cost me a lot of money and because of the memory I can't drive anymore without panicking. The thing is after you take this drug_ you don't know when you are getting up and what you are doing. The effects for me didn't wear off during the day and I would be crying (I'm male) for every little sad thought that came into my head. In ambien trance I resigned from my job and wrote a despicable letter to my boss_ thus burning the bridge. This happened in a bad economy so I was without a job for 3 years_ and currently settled for a job with half the dough. In an ambien trance I told my wife I wanted to have sex with her friend and told her to prostitute herself for money. I nearly lost her as well. At first I took the drug at the doctor prescribed dose of 5-10mg. Once I was addicted I took more. I was on the drug for 2 years. Getting off the drug took 3 months with all the symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Drug seeking behavior_ rebound insomnia_ panic attacks_ shaking hands_ eye twitches_ and delirium. During the withdrawal I was a total jerk with anger tantrums quite uncharacteristic of me. This drug DESTROYED three years of my life and I'm suffering the after effects and I'm not sure for how long.,M,35,2  years>10mg 4X D,4/22/2010,Ambien

In my previous comment neglected to add that along with this drug affecting my central nervous system (numbness in scalp_ forehead_ arms_ hands)it was also making me very depressed.  As I have never been depressed before I really did not know the symptoms until later after speaking w/ friends.  To recap I had really bad sleep deprivation withdrawal for 2-3 days then had another rebound sleep deprivation for another 2-3 days_ all this from Ambien.  Went to my doctor 4x only to have him tell me it was not the Ambien.  I have decided he is full of shit and I have since moved on.  I am better now_ still have some sleep issues but they are minor.  I suppose I am still recovering and everyday is better but I wonder what damage has been done.

I relate to a lot of these comments_ I was hooked on Ambien for five years and I couldn't stop regardless of my wreckless behavior. I became so addicted and took up to 70mg of Ambien each night. I also started taking it during the day to get the euphoric effect. I have done some horrible things while on Ambien. I crashed my car five times_ one time into a house_ and one time into a railroad pole. I received eight traffic tickets driving while on Ambien_ three of them DUI's. I spent thousands of dollars_ and I tried to break into a pharmacy (on Ambien). I have been clean for two years_ and I urge everyone who is addicted to reach out for help. I know that not everyone who takes this drug is going to become addicted_ but there are certain few who will. Most of my damage was done when Ambien first came out_ in the mid 90's when no one had heard of it. Ambien has become so much bigger_ and everyone seems to know what Ambien is all about these days. It's a good drug for those who use it properly_ but I do not fall into that category.

No matter what I took for headache; nothing worked_ still maintained headache.  Thirty days into taking decided to quit as headaches became worse especially at back of head and scalp was becoming numb.  That is when my hell began.  After quitting cold turkey I did not sleep for two days_ got the chills_ hands & feet freezing_ arms felt chilled to the bone in areas around joint_ my scalp went numb moving to my forehead_ my nose went completely dry_ my taste and smell did not seem quite right.  After two days of no sleep I finally managed to sleep maybe 6 hours (had weird dreams w/ vivid colors) and then slept the next two days about 10 hours first day and 6 hours next day (cont'd),I was not out of the woods just yet.  After initial two days of no sleep_ then two days of sleep_ I experienced rebound insomnia for another two days.  Dr. prescribed  Symbyax (anti-depressant_bipolar) to help me fall asleep and I did take for two days but still did not sleep right away as it took couple hours for me to finally fall asleep_ plus the drug did nothing for me but make me very irritable at times.  I has been two weeks since I withdrew from Ambien and I am just now starting to feel better and get somewhat normal sleep.

It got to the point that I couldnt sleep without it_ and after a while it stopped working like it used to.  What did work was to take 2 Benedryl an hour before I went to bed and an Ambien at bedtime.  When I decided to stop_ I would go to sleep at night and if I couldnt sleep for 2 hours_ I would take one.  Finally I was able to sleep for an hour_ and then I woke up.  Overall_ my first night without_ I woke up 5 times and had crazy dreams.  The next night_ I woke up 3 times_ and the dreams calmed down a little.  Last night I only woke up once.  3 nights so far without Ambien and it works great.  My advice is you are trying to quit and not currently taking an excessive amount is to only take it if you have to_ dont go to bed if you are not tired_ and if you cant sleep_ get out of bed and clean_ empty the dishwater_ read a book or magazine.  The first few nights without it will be rough_ but it gets easier each night.

Many other [including personal accounts] of people having walking amnesia--- blacked out_ but doing stuff [one person went driving].Note: my time on the drug was on and off due to ill side effects.,M,20,2  years,1/26/2010,Ambien
362, 1, sleep aide,"As others have posted...at first_ thought it was the answer to my prayers.  first weird side effect was rambling in my sleep.  I had conversations that I didn't remember until days later and then it felt like I was remembering a dream that I had.  I noticed my shower drain would be clogged with hair on a bi-weekly basis.  Memory loss and lack of concentration to be the ""norm"" in the middle of the day.  I had moments of blurred vision and I thought I had ""seen"" something--sometimes in the middle of the day.  I'm an admitted big sissy so even the ocassional out-of-the-corner of my eye sighting didn't really set off any flags...I just thought it was me being typical sissy--weird I know.  This drug is so subtle that you don't realize that it's affecting your mental state even during the daytime.  I hallucinated so badly one evening when I awoke I thought my husband looked like the devil!  The next day I barely remembered the incident--fully believing it was just a dream","My big toe also went numb(thought this was unrelated until today--my toe is finally not numb).  at least since Halloween. I've had panic attacks and headaches--none of which I had ever had before.  We ended a vacation early b/c I wanted to come home and couldn't explain being anxious and nervous.    About a week ago I had the most depressed day in my life. suicidal thoughts beyond words. After confiding to my sister_ she mentioned it could be the Amien.  It's the only medication I take (except my daily low-dose aspirin) so it kinda sounded silly at first but as depressed as I felt_ I was willing to try anything.  This is day 4 and I am shocked at how much better I feel.  It was affecting me so gradually that I hadn't noticed what was happening to me.  It's as if I was on ""auto-pilot"". I have memory and conscienceness of day-to-day activities but it's almost like I've been half asleep the last few months even during the daytime.  Thank God I didn't follow thru on my suicidal thoughts and I confided in someone and realized what was happening to me.  I won't be taking anymore Ambien ever again; it's just not worth the risks.  The weird part is that even though I've stopped taking it_ I haven't had any problems sleeping thru the night and I haven't had any withdraw issues as noted by other posters_ thankfully. This drug numbs your mental processing on such a subtle level that I never thought to question anything about it--until it was nearly too late.",F,44,1  years,1/26/2010,Ambien

364, 4, Back and neck injuries-pain,I have been taking the generic of Ambien for probably two years now. I have not experienced any side effects yet_ other than if I don't take it_ it seems I cannot sleep. I did note that the generics vary. The oval shaped pill by one manufacturer works better for me than the round pill. It is hard to get the pharmacy to have the right one in_ but is worth calling ahead to ask.,I would recommend it_ at least to try it and see if it works for you. I have not had other sleeping aids_ but found that I wake up just fine with this medication. I have taken Lyrica for supposed fibromyalgia and woke up so groggy_ it took hours to wear off. I believe the dose is low_ 5mg. I don't have it with me_ so I cannot check.,F,52,2  years,1/21/2010,Ambien
365, 3, insomnia due to painful breakup,memory loss_ possible deteriorating eyesight,I have taken ambien and it's generic (zolpidem) off and on for almost three years now.  I take only half the dosage. At first I was taking it every night_ occasionally with alcohol.  (Yes I know.  At the time I didn't care.)  I have not had any symptoms of addiction_ but I can see where it could become addictive.  When you take it_ it turns off your mind_ which is a truly wonderful thing if you are in pain.  Sure beats an extreme alternative_ anyway.  However_ I'm now having disturbing and irritating short term memory loss (can't remember what I said 15 min ago_ can't spell anymore_ can't find the word I want).  I don't know if it's Ambien related_ but I wish someone would look into it.  I must add that I agree with those that say lay down when you take it.  Your brain is asleep_ but you may not realize it.  Don't take it for a nap!  That is not long enough to process the drug.  Once you take it_ stay home and stay in bed for the night!,F,36,2.5  years,1/21/2010,Ambien

Hazziness_ memory loss_ dependency_ anxiety_ dry eyes_ sweats_ stomach disturbances_  aggression_ drug idealation_ headache_ jitterness_ mania_ occassional euphoria_ and sleep: walking_ eating_ emailing_ talking.,In the begining it works great putting you to sleep with the prescribed dosages. Soon after though_ you'll start taking more and more for less sleep. As the dosages increase_ the withdrawal symptoms increase. You can feel your body start to crave the medication like any other addictive drug. I am lucky enough to say that no one has died due to me taking ambien_ but I have embarrassed myself and worried my mother. (apparently I call her and obsess over dishwashers).  In my opinion_ this drug should be used to induce sleep when all other remedies are exhausted. Too many provider automatically turn to this med.All medications have unwanted side effects_ and we shouldn't place all the blame pharmacutical companies_ but they need to do a better job announcing the downsides. It is their responsibility to inform the consumer and the FDA job to demand it. FYI - when ambien first came out it was prescribed for no more 3-7 days. That was until lunesta came out with clinical trials up to 6 months with no adverse effects. Millions were then spent on advertisement proving ambien safe for long term use but without long term studies. More research has to be done. I've only been on it for a month. I'm in the process of stopping cold turkey and it's going well. I feel sorry for those who's lives were damaged more severly.  Good luck,M,26,30  days,1/18/2010,Ambien

Very edgy_ aggressive_ agitated_ weepy.  Following occasions (about a dozen) I've tempered the 5mg dose with 0.5mg of Ativan.  It has helped to reduce the next day side effects but not much.  I've had it with this drug.  I had to post because so many people seem to have problems with emotional or personality side effects.  It does work_ but it's not worth it.  In the future_ I'll just take some Ativan or Temazepam and be done with it.

It allows me to wake rested with no grogginess or other side effects. The only downside is you do build a tolerance up which I have and it becomes less effective. In addition_ the night eating has just begun for me. I fight it though. All in all_ it has helped my insomnia problem. It is very hard to go off of being that it is very addictive.

When I first started taking Ambien I thought I found heaven. When it kicks in I got this ""life is beautiful feeling"" and then fell into a happy_ peaceful slumber. Waking up the next day_ I felt refreshed. However_ I discovered this honeymoon period did not last forever. I developed a tolerance and moved on to Ambien CR. In my experience Ambien CR does not produce that ""life is beautiful feeling"". It takes longer to work. You are supposed to take this on an empty stomach and that is very important - no food 2 hours prior. Taking it after 1 to 1 1/2 hours after eating and it would stay in my system the next day. Then came the worst part. I got a good night sleep_ but the next day I experienced extreme headaches_ anxiety_ depression_ aggression_ dread eventually panic attacks. Ambien is something that should only be used occcasionally. Unfortunately_ for those of us who have lived with insommia for years_ once you take it - it is easy to get mentally addicted to.

It's now six years later_ and I've not been able to work for a year due to fatigue and depression that's gotten progressively worse. Why isn't SOMEONE doing a study of the long term affects of this horrendously addictive and dangerous medication?,"I took Ambien for 4 years before major depression issues appeared. For the past year_ I've been so fatigued_ I haven't been able to return to work. I've talked to internists and psychiatrists_ had every blood test imaginable performed_ and tried at least 15 different antidepressants. They all say my problem is ""stress."" I tell them ""The stress is from not being able to get my life back!"" Not one doctor suggested the Ambien might be the problem; they just kept writing the refills. After reading many blogs_ I'm convinced Ambien is the culprit. My symptoms are: chronic fatigue_ depression that is being managed somewhat successfully by Effexor XR_ inability to concentrate_ blurred vision_ sensitivity to noise and visual stimulus (TV_ movies)_ needing higher and higher doses of Ambien to sleep_ major social anxiety_ mental confusion_ sleep-eating_ sleep-cleaning_ and sleep-emailing. I've realized over the last few weeks that my whole day revolves around how soon I can take my Ambien and escape from the world - just like an alcoholic waits for that first drink of the day. If that's not a physical ADDICTION_ I don't know what is. I'm on day 2 tapering off the drug_ and the withdrawals are hell (anxiety_ crying_ fatigue_ major depression_ body aches_ head aches_ nausea). Conclusion - ADDICTION!!

I read this periodically just to remind me how horrible this drug is and it's roll in some of the fallout that occured after taking it and not going to bed immediately. Some have called this the ""devil's drug"" and I couldn't agree more. I work in the pharma industry and can't understand why there isn't more pressure from FDA on the manufacturer. The insert instructs the user to go to bed immediately but does not highlight why_ and that not going to bed immediately is a huge reason why these bizzare side effects occur.

Don't expect to sleep easily without it for a night or two after taking.  After sustained use of ~5 mg/night noticed severely red eyes and dehydration throughout the day.  Couple that with the coffee I would have to drink to clear my head and I was turning into a prune.  Also experienced delayed muscle pain.  Ambien seems to cause me to tighten up just enough that I would have various aches and pains for a few days after taking.  It took me 1.5 years to tie the two together_ but after numerous doctor and physical therapy visits I found that my chronic muscle pain ceased about 2 weeks after stopping Ambien.  When combined with recreational drugs (pot_ E) can lead to some very scary memory loss and impaired judgement episodes (then again_ so can the drugs themselves).  A great ""silver bullet"" for critical nights_ but you will run the risk of dependancy.  At least for me the side effects of prolonged use do NOT make it worth it.",M,37,2  years,12/14/2009,Ambien

I mean DO NOT plan on doing anything with in 1 minute of swallowing the pill!  No lie!  After I would take it_ I would have deep deep conversations with my girlfriend just before falling to sleep.  When I wake in the morning I couldn't remember ANYTHING I said.  SCARY!!!!Also_ it would only keep me sleeping for about 4 - 5 hrs_ then I would wide awake!,I never thought I would ever be able to look into a closet and see EVERY shirt in the closet move up and down_ until I took this drug.  SCARY!!!,M,33,7  days,12/9/2009,Ambien

397, 1, insomnia,I took Ambien 10mg for 7 years. I would have rated it a 5 for the time I took it.  I felt refreshed every morning.  Then suddenly it became ineffective.  Even though Ambien quit working for me I still had to taper off the med.  I believe I was HOOKED. I was moody_ unreasonable_ and could not think straight as well as having NO attention span. I have been off Ambien for 4 years and note  that I have the residual side affects from being on Ambien for that amount of time.  I will never_ ever take another sleep aid.  I have a recurrence of insomnia and I swear my memory has been strongly affected.  It is as though I have mild amnesia and intermittent fogginess.  Seven years is a looong time and it was very easy to obtain a prescription.  I do not know if I will ever recover.,,F,54,7  years,12/8/2009Email,Ambien

400, 1, for sleep,I hadn't taken ambien for months.  I needed some sleep and decided to take one.  9 hours after taking it_ I got up_ showered and got ready for work.  I remember driving the first 9 miles.  After that I remember nothing.  I drove another 15 miles_ apparently darting all over the road with people calling the police reporting a drunk driver.  I ended up crashing into and tearing down 11 guardrails (which kept me from going over a steep embankment) on the opposite of the road_ totalling my SUV.  I am incredibly grateful that I did not hurt or kill someone else and I was not hurt either.  I was in and out of sleep the entire day after the accident going from lucidness to acting like I was drunk.  I remember very little of the events.  It is very terrifying to think of what could have happened.,This drug should be taken off the market before someone is killed as a direct result of someone having taken it.  DO NOT TAKE AMBIEN.  Write your congressmen.,F,62, ,12/4/2009Email,Ambien
401, 1, On and off for 1 year,amnesia_ stumbling_ hallucinations,"The Devil's Drug and possibly a portal to hell.  I have had chronic insomnia for years and started taking Ambien with great success at first.  I would fall asleep right away and wake up rested.  I guess my body built up a tolerance and I wrote emails_ talked to people on the phone (losing several important relationships and getting fired from my job because of the irrational behavior I didn't remember).  I became addicted.  After putting my marriage in danger 3 days ago (I won't go into why_ but it was an ""Ambien Incident"")_ my husband and I stood together and flushed them down the toilet.  Never again.  Never.  I have had high anxiety and hardly slept in the past several nights_ but I don't care.  I'll live through that and get over it - I would not get over losing all the good in my life.  I am determined to get my life back.  I'm glad it works for some_ but please know it is dispensed like candy and with little warning of danger.  It almost ruined my life - don't let it ruin yours.  Seek alternatives!

402, 3, Insomnia due to anxiety,some tiredness durrig the day.,I have had insomnia for years. It comes and goes due to what stresses I have going on in my life. Most recently its really taken a toll on me_ my family and my work. Sleeping for only 2-3 hrs each night_ and that was broken sleep. Waking several times wide eyed and alert but completely exhausted. I crashed at work one day and just lost it. Had a full blown anxiety attack brought on by stress and lack of sleep. My dr prescribed me Ambien and he told me some of the side effects but didn't go into detail. I will be talking to my kids to alert them to the possibility of some of the things I have read on here. I took my first dose_ 10mg_ last night and for the first time in months I actually got some sleep.... 7 hours! I did wake up once to use the bathroom and then went right back to sleep. I do feel a bit tired right now_ but not like before. As for now I am just happy to finally have something to help me sleep. I have rated this drug a 3 because I have only taken it for one night so far_ if anything strange happens_ or if my rating changes I will update my post.,F,34,1  days,12/3/2009Email,Ambien
403, 1, chronic insomnia,first I must admit that I'm probably the biggest hypocrite to ever comment on this site. the first time I entered this site was a couple years ago. I was doing s little homework on my new script_ so when I read some of the posts I actually laughed and had my wife read some of them. it's ironic how things can change in only a couple years.,last month I almost killed my wife and the absolute most terrifying part is that I don't remember one second of it. I don't know if I was dreaming or hallucinating. I just don't know what happened but I know what she told me. you may be reading this and laughing at me. well I understand that as well as anyone but like so many others on this site_ I'm here to warn you. it may only be 1 in 10_000 or 1 in 1000 but what people lose site of is this; that 1 is just like the rest of us. you reading this right now_ you could be that one.if you've already started then stop and if your thinking about it then don't. I will continue to read this periodically but if you read this and then something bad happens later_ please come back and try to make others aware. my posting this may have just convinced you not to take it. and you may have been that one. good luck and god bless,M,34,18  months,12/2/2009,Ambien
404, 1, insmnia,I had been taking Ambien for about 2 months. I have Fibro Myalgia_ and sleeplessness comes with the disease. Taking 10mg every night_ my family had told me several times that I had done/said random things. The worst has to have been sleep driving and the events that happened after I wrecked the car.Luckily I did not total my van_ only minor damage. I do remember getting out of the van but from that point on it is a blur.,"I remember being in a dream_ trying to get to someplace very important. But no matter how hard I tried_ I could not get there_ each step I took_ I would fall. I remember hitting my face on the floor_ which I later learned was actually the railroad tracks. From then_ I have no recollection of anything until around 5:30 when I awoke in the ER with my husband and mother by my side_ and in terrible pain. Evidently_ when I had gotten out of the van I took a long walk on the tracks. The falling that I thought was a dream was not. Based on my body temp when a local Sheriff responded to the call I had been out there for over four hours 3-7am. Covered in blood from may falls_ and a busted nose_ my husband was the first to arrive on the scene. He said the only audible words I said ""where the f%#k am I?"" the rest was gibberish. My body temp was down to 92 degrees_ hypothermia sets in at 94.I was not aware of any of this! I still cannot recall what had happened_ but was out cold in the hospital until after 5 pm that day. After coming to_ I was very disoriented and in a great deal of pain. No broken bones thank goodness_ plenty of bruises!but enough to make sure that I will never take any more! I was later told that I had fallen asleep on the train tracks. The officer who found me could see a train coming_ and had to literally drag me off the tracks before it made it to me. Each time I hear the whistle I cringe_ thinking that could have been the train that would have killed me.",F,34,2  months,12/1/2009Email,Ambien
405, 4, insomnia/ptsd,shortly after i take it i get the drunk feeling_ but im not always tired. usually remember very little and very lovey and express my feelings_ which is quite odd for me.,i started taking ambien while in afghanistan becaues i was staying up for days in a combat zone without sleep. bad nightmares after death of friends_ and major irrability. i have always had sleep problems though  the docs there would only give me 10 at a time so i used the sparingly_ once i got back home my doctor prescribed 4 months worth to me. i have had sex on ambien and do remember it_ my wife says i go a little too long for her....haha. i dont take it if i know im not going to get at least 6 hours of sleep_ but on those nights i notice that i dont sleep well and my nightmares return. wife often asks me the next day if i remember doing this or saying that and its usually no. i would say its helped a lot but i think there will be some withdrawl when my prescription runs out. drinking 1 beer with this drug increases its effect 10 fold!! tread carefully when taking this drug.,M,30,10  months,11/30/2009,Ambien
406, 1, Insomnia,"I became hyper-aggressive sexually. Shortly after taking it_ I would start touching my wife's body. We have a great sex life_ so normally that wouldn't be a problem. But this was different_ this was_ as my wife put it_ ""not me"". She said that it was like I was asleep with my eyes open. The last time it happened she told me to stop but I continued. I woke up the next morning to find a note explaining what had happened and that she had went to her mom's to stay. It took me almost three weeks to completly stop taking it and another month to finally sleep through the night without it.","Before these things started to happen_ I had experienced a few other strange effects but they weren't anything like this. Once I took the dog out and a few times I got up and ate_ without being able to recall either but this was much different. To see my wife of six years in tears_ telling me that it was me but it ""wasn't me"" scared me beyond words.If you are reading this and considering taking this medication_ I would say to do your research. I have read page after page on this site_ some bad and some good but the bad can be very bad.

410, 3, anxiety related insomnia,None. This stuff is the bomb.  Knocks you out like a ball bat and you wake up fresh and chipper like a squirrel.,I gave it a 3 because while Zolpidem is a great sleep drug_ it has a nasty hook if you don't watch. At least for me_ it did_ despite the fact that I was trying to be pretty careful with it_ only taking it 4 nights a week and only taking 5mg (as opposed to 10) at least part of the time.  It isn't a benzo_ but acts on the same receptors and has a short half life. When I tried to go to 5 mg every other night_ I started getting tight chest anxiety and shortness of breath.  So_ now my psych is tapering me over time.  My opinion is that it is very good stuff for very short term insomnia_ but you have to be careful with it. Real careful. It has withdrawals (at least for me) that were like the shorter half life benzos and that's nasty stuff.,M,57,7  months,11/17/2009,Ambien

Think carefully before taking this if you are sensitive to medications... the side effects may be worth it to you if you have chronic insomnia.  I went to my doctor_ who is more of a holistic MD_ and he gave me supplements to try instead.  It's been 1 week since my last ambien and I feel 100% better.

Completely changed my personality!","I did not take Ambien nightly_ only as needed.  Worked very well for me at 1st.  Side effects began with incoherent speech.  The longer I took Ambien_ the worse the side effects became.  The following behaviors that I exhibited ARE NOT normal for me & a bit embarassing: hallucinations_ memory loss before bed_ eating large amounts of odd food_ stupid phone calls/text messages_ strong urges to snoop through my bf's stuff. Went through his personal items & scattered stuff everywhere (that was fun explaining). Strange sexual behaviors like spending hours (yes hours) looking at pornographic material online.  Went back through my browser history next day & was shocked/appalled.  Really started questioning Ambien when side effects escalated into dangerous activities such as seeking alcohol_ pain killers_ Valium_ even more Ambien if I could find it around the house.  Final straw was the day my boyfriend hurried home after receiving nonsensical texts & strange ""personal"" pics from me. He arrived & found that I had cuffed my hands/legs together & had his loaded pistol lying on the bed.  Of course I was asleep on the floor by then and didn't remember a thing.

It probably wouldn't have been a problem if I had gone straight to bed instead of staying up.  On the plus side_ I realized that I was hallucinating at the time and thought it was funny.  It only lasted for about 5 minutes and then eased up and I went to bed.   It has not happened since that first dose.,When I first started taking it_ I was waking up after about 5 hours and was unable to get back to sleep. Thankfully_ it now lasts the whole night.

The doctors are baffled by my symptoms and they are only getting worse.Please reply if you think you can help.I am going to the Mayo Clinic soon for an evaluation.,I think ambien is safe as long as it is taken for a short time and not on a daily basis. I was taking way too much because 10mg wasn't working anymore and with a chronic pain conditon I have all I wanted to do is sleep. If anyone who reads this can of me  some help_ then please let me hear from you: My question is how long does it take for ambien to get completely out of one's system?,F,53,6  years,10/7/2009Email,Ambien

440, 5, Trouble staying asleep,My problem was insomnia where I would fall asleep fine but wake every night at 2-3AM and lay awake for hours. Ambien CR helped me get the full 8 hours sleep I needed. No side-effects except in the morning if I took the pill too late in the evening. Then I would still feel groggy_ spacie in the AM.,I take 1/2 a pill per night. These seems to be no addiction or tolerance problem as I only take the pills periodically as needed.,F,51,1  years,10/4/2009,Ambien
441, 2, insomnia= brought on by menopause,i did sleep well after taking Ambien. after a month or so had to increase my dose.  the big problem is that I cannot focus my eyes the next morning and had a groggy/confused thinking_ especially in the morning after.  As far as i know i never got up in the night.,I had to stop. my eye sight was getting so bad smd I need to be able to concentrate at work.  the benefits do not out weigh the bad side effects.  I wish I had kmown about the eye thing before.  I know it is not one on the worst side effects after reading some of these horror stories. I feel as though there are some lingering problems with my eyes,F,46,4  months,10/4/2009Email,Ambien
442, 4, Insomnia,Loves that it helps me to fall asleep pretty quickly_ but sometimes not quickly enough. I have made cell phone calls to my friends and been horrified the next day when I have looked at my cell phone record and not remembered any of them. I turn into a real chatter box after I take the Ambien. I very seldom wear jewelry and last night I woke up with 4 necklaces on_ multiple bracelets on and rings and bracelets laying all over the bathroom. I don't remember doing any of that. I am afraid to ask my husband if I was acting any differently last night for fear of what he would say.I have had insomnia for as long as I can remember and being able to get a good night's sleep makes all the difference in the world to me. It is worth a little weirdness just to get some rest.People that don't have insomnia just don't have a clue how miserable your life can get.,Just don't leave your house when you are taking this medication.

I have been going to bed_ sleeping like a rock for one hour and then my mind runs in circles all night and I don't get any more restful sleep.  Reading these comments has quite frankly scared the crap out of me but I have alerted my husband to watch me for several nights and make sure I am just sleeping and not wandering around the house eating_ or doing something else stupid...I will post my results on here in a week.,F,33,1  days,9/29/2009,Ambien
445, 5, Insomnia,I night eat. It could be perimenopause or my acid stomach. I did this before I took Ambien but only before my period but it seems to happen more now. I think it puts you in an hypnotic state. You would only do what you might normally do.,I take it every night.I believe that it is a life saver for me. Very few people understand. I don't like the night eating and wish I could stop. It upsets my family.Wish I knew what a sleep specialist thought about how long I've been taking it.

I therefore have 2+ years of unremembered nights. A few examples of what I was told I did under the influence of Ambien: called/texted/instant messaged people with aggressive messages (both sexual and violent); threatened my father; spoke in gibberish; wandered around my house and street; took extra Ambien; had sex; and drank alcohol. However_ the worst by far was tearing open my chest with a razor blade. My mother walked in and found me in a pool of blood. I have no memory of this. When she called my boyfriend over to help calm me down_ I hallucinated he was my rapist (the reason I was taking Ambien in the first place) and cowered in a corner begging him not to hurt me again. This drug blew my mind apart and left me with a mutilated chest. Please be careful when taking this.,F,21,2.5  years,9/23/2009Email,Ambien
449, 5, ,The stuff works well.  However the hypnotic side effects and memory loss have been used against me by lovers and family.  They know to wait until I'm about to fall asleep to ask for money or favors.  I've learned to wait until I'm alone before taking Ambien.  I've also learned not to hide anything or clean house after taking the drug.  I lose things for months if I do.,Ambien's memory loss side effect is a great way to watch a movie or show you really like.  I never remember the ending and get to watch the movie several times as if it were the first time.,M,52,4  years,9/22/2009,Ambien

He also sent a total of 9 emails to female friends on Facebook_ propositioning sex.  9 women!

Tylenol pm used to work for me unitl the pain in my legs and knees got so severe I couldn't stand going to bed.   I take it most nights now and feel very dependant on it. I am not sure it is from the Ambien_ but I am agitated and mildly depressed off and on.,I know I am dependent on it and would like to quit it to see if the agitation goes away.

457, 3, sleep difficulties,I am writing to offer condolences to the woman who discovered she'd slept with her son's friend after taking Ambien with a glass of wine. My heart aches for you! You must accept your innocence even if others don't. At first I thought Ambien was a wonder drug. I had to sleep in an arctic field camp (with continuous summer daylight_ heat and mosquitoes) sharing a weatherport with six other people_ and between the Ambien and earplugs got the best two weeks of sleep ever. Then on vacation in Hawaii (where I slept on the Murphy bed in the living room because of my husband's snoring and my light sleeping) I took it one night after a glass of wine and walked down to the water. All I remember after being at the shoreline was waking up the next morning fully clothed in bed with my husband. Thank God I'd found the right unit_ and was in bed with my own husband_ but it could have all come down so differently and I wouldn't have known or remembered a thing. I have not taken Ambien since.,I was only taking Ambien on an as-needed basis when traveling or having a particularly difficult time sleeping.

461, 1, Imsonia,I could fall asleep quickly_ but in a few hours_ wake up again.  Sleep walking_ sleep eating etc.,I will NEVER EVER take this drug again.  I was going through a bad time with a relationship break up_ losing my job_ and having to find a new place to live.  I couldn't sleep for all the stress so my doc gave me some ambien.  The first couple of nights were good_ I would still wake up but I'd go back to sleep.  Then I started sleep walking... finding things in my room or in my kitchen when I would wake up.  Then one night I went to bed and the next morning I woke up in the hospital.  I had an interview to go to that morning_ evidently (by counting the pills in the bottle) I had taken about four more ambien in the middle of the night_ got up the next morning and DROVE MY CAR IN MY SLEEP and wrecked.  I totalled my car_ I missed my job interview.  I was so out of it_ in this unwordly haze_ that I took the bus to my sister's house because I didn't have enought sense to call someone to come get me.

Symptoms less after being off ambien for a week but they have been occassionally recurring during the second-third week.,Began at 10 mg for 1 1/2 months.  It would give about 4-5 hours of sleep.  But I did not like the off-balance feeling and other sensations. I did not have lapses of memory or wandering but a gradual and then faster increase in anxiety for no reason.  Then I began cutting back to 5 mg and then none every other day to wean off (I asked my pharmacist how to wean off ambien).  Although I would never take ambien again (as another respondent said I would rather be sleepy than ever feel this way again)_ for some it might be useful for occassional insomnia - but one should be watchful for any adverse reactions.,M,60,2  months,9/1/2009,Ambien
463, 3, sleep problems,Memory loss while drug was in my system; unusual behaviors.,Ambien really helps me sleep_ but what I do while I am 'sleeping' scares me and my family so much I am afraid to take it.

Another night_ I found myself driving my car 10 miles from home at about 2AM in my robe and slippers_ with no memory of getting in the car or driving. Most frightening of all_ my wife says I hit her in the face when she refused to get up and make me a grilled cheese sandwich in the middle of the night.

Every time he took the meds he acted different the next day. Somehat weird but I never put two and two together at that time. I was looking for sleep eating ect_ the side effects that you heard of at that time.,The last time he took this drug_ I found him the next morning. Ambien took my life away when it took my husband from me. I agree that not everyone has this type of reaction but just the few that have is way too many. I love and miss my husband everyday. Since then I have heard from many of the people I know about some really wierd and dangerous side effects that I did not know then. Please DO NOT take this drug or let anybody you know take it. After all it is not a sleeping pill_ it is classified as a hypnotic. This is the beginning of the problem. When people lost their sense of smell due to a cold med_ they yanked it from the market_ why is Ambien sill out there?

467, 5, insomnia,mild visual hallucinations and slight drunk-like effect about a half hour to an hour after administration. other than that_ none.,works fantastically for me. the nice thing about ambien is that its half life is only a few hours. for people that struggle with calming their minds down at bedtime this is the perfect remedy. it knocks you out_ being a hypnotic_ and by the time the effects wear off you are already in deep sleep. some might find it effective to split a 10mg pill and take 5mg before bedtime and again during the middle of the night if you wake up. this would be useful for those that have trouble staying asleep.when you wake up the next morning there is little left in your system and you feel refreshed and well rested. as far as i can tell_ there are no hangovers or cravings for this drug. and if there were cravings i'd imagine them to be miniscule in comparison to other drugs like the benzodiazepines.in my experience_ a good way to reduce tolerance and make sure the same dose is effective day after day is to adopt a vigorous workout routine and include lots of physical activity in your daily regimen. this cycles the medicine and other chemicals out of your body through sweat and circulation and allows kind of a clean slate for administration of the drug again the following night. i notice that when i don't work out the dose takes a longer time to work and is not as powerful as when i've exercised that day. it has a lot do with metabolism.,M,30,2  weeks,8/20/2009,Ambien

473, 1, insomnia due to bipolar,suicidial thoughts and actions_aggressive behavior_memory loss_not remembering incidents. she was on 10mg and sometimes after taking it she was still up hours later and this is when there were strange behaviors that she does not recall.,My 14 year old daughter has been taking ambien for over 6 months now and last week she had an episode where she took a handfull of pills_was very threatening to myself and to the family pet_ she has bipolar disorder so the rage and manic behavior is nothing new but have never seen her have the suicidal behaviors or thoughts. I remembered hearing about this on tv and thought I would check it out. seems as though this is not a rare occurance. this seems like a very dangerous drug to me and I will no longer be giving it to my daughter and we will see if her behaviors seem to improve. Also a few of these messages say that these problems are only occuring in people with psychotic problems I have been reading most of them and the main thing everyone has in common is insomnia and strange bhaviors due to this drug. Maybe the fact that some people have a mental disorder just makes them more likley to have more severe side effects. There are way to many problems listed here for us to ignore and something needs to be done about this drug it is my duty as a parent to protect my child from harm and I thought it was the doctors duty to perscribe safe and helpful medicines.

Things have been fine other than feeling overly tired when I wake up and less than an hour after taking it I become what seems like very_ very drunk. Last night_ however_ was the first time I saw the figurines on my night stand moving. I'm not kidding. I even grabbed one and it was moving in my hand. I have never taken more than prescribed (5mg) and I'm too chicken to abuse it! It's helped me sleep great_ but these recent side effects concern me enough to get in touch with my doctor. 'Til then I'll cut the pill in half!,This med has helped me a great deal. I suffer with depression so 7-8 hours sleep is essential for me. It is habit forming though. If I run out of pills (forgetting to refill) I'm dead. If I take Tylenol PM in place of the Ambien it causes me to get the shivers. I asked a pharmacist about it and they didn't see where the two meds could clash_ but it did on me.

I would sleep only 3 hours per night and then wake up - wide awake. Went to sleep at 9:00PM woke at 12:00PM. Went to sleep at 11:00PM woke up at 2:00PM. Ambien let me sleep all night. I Wake up once or twice per night but fall back asleep quickly. Only take 5 milligrams sometimes but mostly 2.5 (split pill). No other drugs other than beer. Lots of stress in 2008-2009 being a supervisor. Never had a noticable concentration problem until after about 36 months of use. Not real bad but sort of noticable. At this point a slight lack of concentration is better than laying awake for 3 to 4 hours a night and dozing off at 5:00AM when the alarm goes off at 5:30 AM. Take it at bedtime and go directly to sleep. Don't be dumb and go out to the store or try to make a midnight snack after taking the sleep pill.

For the last year_ I thought my almost 3 year old son was coming down at night and eating_ because I would find bowls and spoons and food all over the counter. I knew I didn't do it_ so he must have done it_ and gone back to bed. Sadly_ I now know it must have been me. Last week I woke up in the emergency room on a Sunday. The last thing I remember was taking my normal 20 mg dose (as prescribed)on Friday night. I now know my mistake was taking it before going to bed_ while I was putting my children to bed. I found out Sunday morning that I had somehow between Friday night and Saturday night_ purchased beer (I'm in recovery and don't drink) and had taken a total of 40 ambien. My son was found outside in the street and was almost hit by a car. My neighbor came over_ called 911_ I was taken to the hospital and my children are not under protective care with CPS. I am charged with criminal neglect_ have lost my children and may go to jail. Please don't take this drug. I,,F,44,2  years,7/29/2009Email,Ambien
483, 5, trouble staying asleep,Very few_ if any. No drowsiness. No bad dreams. No sleepwalking.,"I love Ambien. I use it only when I travel or when I wake up in the middle of the night--never to get to sleep per se. Dr. tried to ""limit"" my prescription to 20 pills every six months. I dumped my doctor! 5 mb gets me back to sleep if I wake up (around 3 a.m.) It does the trick_ no problem.",F,55,5  years,7/26/2009,Ambien
484, 5, Severe Insomnia,None.  This is the only medication I have taken that caused no side effects.,"I couldn't sleep_ and hadn't slept for about 3 years.  I'd just be up almost all night_ finally getting to sleep at about 5am_ no matter what I did.  My doctor had me do a sleep study_ which medically confirmed my problem.  Ambien worked initially_ but then I'd wake up after about 4-5 hours.  Then Ambien CR became availabe_ and it's been sweet dreams ever since.  If you take it as prescribed_ you will fall asleep repidly_ and the controlled release version will keep you asleep.  I have never experienced grogginess the next morning_ or any weird ""episodes"" at night.  It works if you take as directed_ don't mix it with alcohol at all_ or any other medication.",F,44,7  months,7/24/2009,Ambien

It has restored my sleep patterns and has saved my life.,M,,3  months,7/20/2009,Ambien

DO NOT DRINK_ DO NOT TAKE STUPIDLY TAKE WITH OTHER PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WITHOUT ASKING YOUR DOCTOR.,Like all drugs_ you have to take it as directed.Why do so many people have trouble with that?!?!?Don't drink with it_ period. Don't mix with other drugs unless cleared by your doc. If you take it while getting into bed you won't have a problem. You will fall asleep very rapidly. I have fallen asleep with the light on and a book in my hand and awoken the same way...truly_ it happens quickly.,F,56,10  years,7/18/2009,Ambien
487, 3, Insomnia,Strange dreams_ odd behavior_ wild sex_ and not remembering anything from the night before!,I took this medication about 8 yrs ago for 2 years.  I abused it and became addicted.  It was very hard to get off of it.  I think it took me almost 6 months to get a good full nights sleep after I stopped taking it.  I am on it again because it works and I am more mature to take it correctly.  I hope that this time around it will be short term use and easier to get off.,F,31,2  years,7/13/2009,Ambien
488, 4, Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder,Short term memory loss_ strange behavior with loss of memory regarding the behavior,I have used Ambien (10mg) for approx. 2 years. It's definitely helped my DSPD_ which can be described as permanent jet lag. My normal sleep time without Ambien would be around 5-6am_ and it's been that way since I was a child. Ambien has been pretty helpful with helping me push back my sleep time. That is_ if you use it AS PRESCRIBED. The only time I experience the weird behavioral things is when I don't immediately go to bed after taking it. Yes_ I have completely rearranged my living room furniture in the middle of the night. But again_ thats only when I dawdle around after I've taken it. Be responsible_ and this medicine might work for you. But_ also no medicine will work the same way for everyone. For me the positives outweigh the negatives.,F,25,2  years,7/7/2009,Ambien
489, 1, insomnia/sleep disorder,My 24 year old son started taking Ambien one week ago. Although he said he woke up feeling great_ he also suffered serious side effects. He began sleep walking with one episode resulting in him going outside and using a saw to cut down two trees in the yard. He went back to bed sweaty and covered in saw dust with no memory of the event. His wife told him about it.Last night_ while sleep walking_ he called his psychiatrist and told him he has taken 12 Ambien tabs. The doctor told him to go to the emergency room or he would send an ambulance for him. After being treated for a possible overdose at the er and having the er physician sign an order of protective custody it was found that he had actually not taken 12 tabs. Luckily today the attending physician was familiar with these type of side effects with Ambien. Obviously he is immediately off the medication before a more tragic result takes place.,,M,24,7  days,7/7/2009,Ambien

491, 5, yes,None at all,I have had trouble sleeping for years. Been on Ambien_ 10 mg_ for about 3 months. It has worked wonders for me. I have always had vivid dreams_ so no change there. I wake up feeling better than I have in years. Even if I wake up in the middle of the night to use the restroom_ I remember doing so. Nothing crazy to report.I think some of the folks here need to consider other meds they may be combining with abmien - it is a strong drug and doesn't interact well with many other drugs or alcohol. THe one time I had a few drinks and took an ambien_ I snored_ talked and giggled in my sleep (or so my boyfriend reported). Don't jump to the conclusion that it's automatically just the ambien causing this behavior. Also_ note many of these folks aren't going to bed when they take it and aren't educating themselves on what they are taking. I would recommend ambien to anyone who needs to solve insomnia. It's truly changed my life for the better.,F,32,3  months,7/2/2009,Ambien

If one isn't familiar with this drug_ nurses in hospital should ask patient before administering if they want to be strapped to the bed..make them aware of the tremendous amounts of side effects or hand them a paper to read about it or something!! My mother was sleep walking & hallucinating (which she has never done before) in her hospital room...she remembers falling_ called for nurse (she was right across from nurses station...guess they were off helping someone else)...she proceeded to get up to a standing position and fell again completely backwards and awoke to the attendants getting her up off the floor. WARNING: STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG!! AND THEY TOOK ZICAM OFF THE MARKET_ HA!  Everyone I have talked to since_ rolls their eyes_ had a personal bad experience_ or knows someone who had a personal bad experience while on this drug... they need to take it off the market before people end up killing themselves or others because they don't know what they're doing while on it&/or before the manufacturer ends up with a class action lawsuit against them .......hmmmm!,F,56,1  times,7/2/2009Email,Ambien

Have discovered I binge ate during the night and one time I even drove to the gas station while in a trance. Also caused crazy sex sessions when both me and my wife take it together_ although it screws with erections so it does not enhance the moment.,Started taking it when I couldn't get to sleep but soon found myself taking it almost every night. Eventually because of the episodes I mentioned in the side effects section_ I stopped taking it altogether. When used occassionally for insomnia it is a great medication and I recommend it if you need it. Otherwise_ be careful about binge eating_ hypnotic sex_ and sending out emails that you have no idea when out until you checked the sent folder.,M,33,3  years,6/30/2009Email,Ambien

I was dry heaving in my sleep_ my son woke me up & I had tears n my eyes from heaving so hard_ Another thing I want everyone 2 know is my husband also takes Ambien. He has driven while on it_ I watched him crash n2 a large plant by our garage door last week_ he said he didn't c it sitting there_ the other night he took 3 10mg Ambiens_ I was so afraid I called the consul,To the mother who left that comment about her 25 year old son_ I'm sorry for your loss_ and I believe you leaving that comment on here will save a life_ even if it is just one.

I developed a rash the very first day taking the drug_ saw a Dr. about it day 3 and was told this could be a very bad sign_ so I was taken off of it.,This drug works well if you use it exactly as intended. Take it when you plan to go to bed_ not when you plan to watch tv for an hour before going to bed_ or surf the web_ etc. You'll end up driving to the convenience store_ etc. If you have a history of drug abuse_ I'd recommend Lunesta instead as this drug has potential for abuse.,M,31,3  days,6/14/2009,Ambien

I've had serious insomnia for the past year due to anxiety and depression after a divorce. I've tried numerous sleep aids_ both prescription and OTC_ and Ambien (not Ambien CR) seems to work the best for me. Unfortunately_ that just means I can usually sleep about 4 - 5 hours instead of the 9 or so hours my body truly needs. An improvement over the 2 - 3 hours I was only getting a night for close to a year_ but still not enough.I have found that 10mg Ambien along with 1 - 2 BioChem Tension RX Nighttime (OTC_ made by Country Life) works a little better than the Ambien alone so I take that combo 2 - 3 times a week.,F,32,1  years,6/7/2009,Ambien

What they do not tell you is hopefully you are not one suffering suicidal thoughts while under an ambien blackout. He might be in the unlucky group that Ambien affects this way but the devastation is 100% when you loose your 25year old son in this way.For those skeptics he was not suffering form depression or suicidal thoughts.

I remember waking up in my mother's house_ the bedroom I always sleep in when visiting.  Everything hanging on the walls took on a face of some evil looking person.  The digital clock was flashing in and out toward me and back toward me and back.  I sat up in bed and was screaming in a mean voice at my husband asking him who he was and where was my husband.  He said I did this for a while and our little boy was sleeping with us and apparently I was flailing my arms around and hit him on the arm.  I remember my husband saying in a frustrated tone for me to lay down and that I had already hurt our son once.  I don't remember what happened after that but when I awoke the next morning feeling very tired and hung over and very freaked out about everything in the room appearing as people coming at me it was enough to NEVER EVER take this med again.

521, 4, Insomnia since childhood,Auditory and visual hallucinations mainly. Hallucinations only occur if I do not go to sleep after taking the medication (which occured if something came up... ie-a big deadline_ family member came over_ etc.). Funny taste in mouth and throat. About the hallucinations_ for anyone interested... I have been taking sleep meds for 15 years. I went to a sleep study at 8 that showed I woke up some 25-32 times a night and never entered REM sleep. I have taken all types of sleeping meds and started AMBIEN within the past year. It works great for sleep with little weight gain_ memory loss_ or drowsiness the next day.I have had very convincing hallucinations_ however. So convincing_ I called the police on one occasion. _,Concerning the hallucinations_ I live in an appartment and can hear my neighbors moving around... which is normal in a multi-family complex. For some reason_ when taking AMBIEN_ I have had experiences where I interperet these noises to be malicious and think people are in my home. I have even thought_ and seen_ in fact_ people moving in my home. These hallucinations have only happened twice within the year_ but were so vivid and convincing I called the police.To the woman who said everyone with a side-effect must have something wrong with them; trust me_ I do not. Besides insomnia_ I am very stable as an individual. I have a bachelors degree and work in a very competitive industry as an executive.I have been at sleep medication since I was 8. I am 23 now. I have documented insomnia. Ambien has a very strange side effect... no other medication or circumstance has caused hallucinations to me_ on any level.I still take ambien_ it is the only drug that works well for me.

The Earth is angry because oil is her blood and we are draining her. Thats why we have earthquakes_ hurricanes_ etc. She's very angry. Made sense at the time....  When I take it now_ I make sure that I'm in bed.,Worked very well putting me to sleep and awakening refreshed. I'm not a recreational drug user so these side effects were very strange for me.

I have no sleep walking_ no sleep eating_ no driving_ or weird halucinations. I don't feel groggy in the morning_ feel fine during the day_ and love the feeling of a good nights sleep. Upon trying to quit I have had the most odd_ vivid dreams_ like 10 different ones throughout the night because I wake up_ then fall back asleep (repeat X 10). I cant say too many bad things about this drug because it REALLY helped me when I needed it most_ but I do sometimes get anxious if I dont have a months worth in reserve_ just in case. I do work in a pharmacy and I have only heard 1 complaint of sleepwalking (taking out the trash at 3am)other than that the only complaints I hear_ and its not many_ is that it just doesn't work for some.,F,32,1  years,5/15/2009Email,Ambien
524, 3, insomnia/anxiety,dizziness_ drowsiness_ confusion_ loss of memory,It worked good the first few times i took it_ after that i was prescribed 5mg- 4xday for anxiety because i found out i was pregnant and was taken off of lorazepam. It didn't affect me at all as far as making me drowsy after the first week_ it definately helped with my anxiety. I did notice that about 20 minutes after i took it_ i wouldn't remember anything i did after that. I'd eat_ make phone calls_ go out places_ and i wouldnt remember anything until i awoke the next day. It was a very scary thing. It makes you feel good and helps_ but it's definately not worth the side effects.,F,24,4  weeks,5/14/2009,Ambien
525, 1, insomnia,Using this medicine may very well be_ the worst decision I've ever made in my life. I used Ambien for about three years with only minor issues. These ranged from falling asleep in the bathtub to sleep eating. I quickly learned not to take a bath after taking it and the sleep eating wasn't too serious. However one night my life dramatically changed and I fear it will never be the same. To keep the story short_ I had sex with my neighbor's son. He is an eighteen year old kid_ who I had known for several years. The night it happened I had an intense headache_ so I got into bed early and had taken my usual 10mg of Ambien along with a glass of wine. Around 10:00 the boy came by to see my son_ who had gone with my husband to an auto auction. I have no recollection of what actually happened but when it finally surfaced through one of my son's other friends_ I was devastated.  ,When this first surfaced_ I was furious at him for telling such a horrible lie. But I have a very small tattoo approx. 1/2 inch in diameter that I got when I was a freshman in college. Not even my children knew I had it_ due to its size and location. So when I discovered that he knew about it_ I could think of no other way that he could have known. As distasteful it was_ it was still true. I'm so ashamed of what I've done and the heartache it has caused my family. I have even considered suicide_ just to put an end to the shame. I'm writing this with tears streaming down my face_ so even if you cant understand my situation_ please don't respond to this in a hateful way. I just thought if my sharing this could possibly help someone to not ruin so many lives_ as I have unfortunately done_ it would be worth it. Please consider the consequences before taking this medicine.,F,45,3  years,5/13/2009,Ambien
526, 1, insomnia,It was a great drug to fall asleep and I never noticed any side effects until about 7 years later with daily use and sometimes using more than the prescribed dose_ my mouth started burinng_ my teeth began to hurt (like nerve pain) and the pain is constant and chronic. I continued taking it unaware it could be the cause of such pain. Today_ I am wondering after having been off of ambien for 5 months at one time and saw no change_ could it still be in my system causing my oral_ facial pain as well as tingling and numbness in my hands and feet. Is there anyone who can answer that question for me?How long does it take to get completely out of the system and undo any potential damage?,There are other safer products found at health food stores that I use like L-tryphtophan and melatonin in combination. I still use ambien but I find that 10mg doesn't work like it used to.I take 1 1/2 -2 sometimes but I don't know how safe it is and if I am causing potential neurological problems. Can anyone answer that one for me?,F,53,7  years,5/13/2009Email,Ambien
527, 4, inability to fall asleep,ocasional headache after awakening. That may just be a hangover. Memory loss while under the drugs influence. Hope my wife did not use those anal beeds again,"I always drink a beer or 2 before taking the drug. 10mg tablet I break in 1/2 and take the 1/2 tablet and chase it down with the last drink of beer. Asleep with in 30 minutes and sleep 3 to 4 hours. I always wake up a few hours later. Some times I will drink another beer or 2 and take the other 1/2 and sleep another 3 hours_ or sometimes I am just up and ready to go the rest of the day. Am I addicted? YES. I will lay in bed for hours and can not go to sleep without it.

528, 1, Bipolar/sleep disorder/mood swings,Sleep eating gained 60 lbs. in l0 years I have been on it_ sleep driving_ memory loss_ amnesia_ buying online_ overdosed twice with NO intention of doing so_ calling people in family all hours of the night_ visits from family members and no recollection whatsoever,This drug is FDA approved but I strongly believe it should be taken off the market/perhaps a group effort with the help of a lawyer. I strongly believe it is a deadly drug with many people experiencing the same problems as I have had. People have lost their lives due to things this drug causes them to do if not under the influence of Ambien. You think you are awake_ you believe you know what you are doing; but family members tell you otherwise_ my husband had to constantly make sure food was not in my mouth nightly; everytime I got up.

529, 4, Insomnia,Drunk feeling/memory loss/eating weird foods/masturbating more then usual/texting late at night,Ok so like this drug is great; however_ it is so freakin addictive. Does it help me sleep? The answer is yes!! I just don't fancy the idea of having amnesia every night. I will lay in bed the minute I take it. Then BAM! All of a sudden I will feel so good and buzzed that I will get out of bed and do shit for like 2 hrs before I finally crash out. For instance; I would text my friends late at night. (Good thing they stay up too) Eat all kinds of weird food. Masturbate more then normal. Yeah you are probably thinking what's considered normal? Well I did it more then what I would consider normal. At least for a girl. I would try on tons of outfits so I would have new ideas what to wear to work the next day. Hmm what else....oh and if you think that's weird get this. I would blow off going out with my friends sometimes just so I can stay home and take my ambien early. Well that's a great life.

I think a lot of the problems posted here are from psychotic people who have other very deep seated problems; I don't think it is this drug causing their behavioral issues.,Who takes a sleep medicine and then drives or tries to stay up?  Why take it if that is your intent?  My worst issue is that I have sress headaches but I am also under a lot of stress from business and family illness issues.  It's difficult to know if the Ambien is the cause of my headaches.  I don't take any other meds for anything.,M,56,2  years,5/6/2009,Ambien

532, 5, counteract drug induced insomnia,Short-term memory loss beginning about 30 minutes after taking Zolpidem_ which is the generic version of Ambien_ until I fall asleep. After taking it for 8 months I am beginning to occasionally experience memory loss during the day_ difficulty concentrating_ difficulty staying focused_ and a slight overall degradation of mental ability.,This drug is wonderful for counteracting the insomnia caused by other drugs. I am taking Pegasys injections weekly to treat Hepatitis-C (HCV)_ which for me causes severe insomnia (that is not the case for everyone taking Pegasys). The only way I could remain on HCV treatment was to address what I refer to as drug induced insomnia. HCV treatment has been very successful! I might have liver cancer by now without the Zolpidem/Ambien to permit me to stay on HCV treatment. I will stop taking Zolpidem/Ambien when HCV treatment ends. I recognize that I may experience long-term consequences from taking Zolpidem/Ambien for so long_ but I need to solve one problem at a time. I'm very grateful for this drug!,M,50,8  months,5/4/2009,Ambien
533, 4, Insomnia,Memory loss_ texting people really late_ eating late_ buying stuff online_ seeing things move on the headboard...,I actually googled 20 mg ambien. I was trying to find out if it would be ok to double the dose as I still wake some during the night and didn't with cr. After coming to this site first I will not be trying that. In fact I will go for at least halving my dose every other night...and staying in bed...I take it expecting it to put me to sleep but it doesn't. I would lay in bed reading waiting on it to knock me out and it wouldn't. I would call my sons_ i texted my Pastor once at 12:30 am... go get grapes out of the fridge and eat... I would pick up my book the next day and start where the bookmark was then back up a few pages finding nothing i remembered reading till i backed up a couple of chapters...my family also teases me about how I act after taking it like I am acting high on it doing all of these weird things but as some say the being able to sleep outweighs those things when you do not sleep without it. Tho I am concerned now as others have stated here about permanant memory loss... I am 49 and have always suffered with insomnia...herbal stuff breaks my face out... tylenol pm and those things give me nightmares...i have found no other working alternative... I also take 60 mg cymbalta...I don't know what else I can do...,F,49,1  years,5/4/2009Email,Ambien
534, 4, insomnia,"Interesting history. It worked very well at first and caused me to have extremely PLEASANT dreams.   HOWEVER_ I have always had a drink bef. bed - a hangover (pun both intended_ and not) of yrs. of insomnia. Of cs._ Ambien w/ alcohol is strongly counteradvised_ but I persisted: ""I'll be ok"".   This was 11 yrs. back. It worked v. well until 3-4 yrs. ago_ then became less effective. Upped the alcohol. A few years ago my MD suggested that I cut back to 5 mg_ because of my age (67 yrs.). I did_ and things seemed ok. About that time I cut back to 1 can of beer/PM. Still pretty good_ but less able to fall asleep at will. Hm.   Recently_ however_ needing to get up earlier_ I went back to 10 mg.; then started having two cans of brew. It was only then that my wife noticed that somebody had been doing rather wierd things around the house at night. Who? I'm never able to recall a thing.

I know I'm dependent on it_ but it hasn't been a problem yet.  I do try to take 1/2 of a 10 mg. pill at least 2-3 times per week (and a full one the rest of the time).  If I take 1/2_ I will wake up more often during the night.,F,42,14  months,4/27/2009,Ambien
538, 5, insomnia,Getting up in the middle of the night to eat weird things. Some visual halucinations. Acting drunk and silly.,I have been taking 10mg ambien for about 2 years. I have had some pretty weird halucinations I thought my coat rack was mocking me one night one night I thought my carpet was bubbling up and one night I saw little rivers with little canoes in the wood grain on my kitchen counter. I don't remember these the next day but my family tells me about them (they will tease me about it the next day). I also sometimes will get up in the middle of the night to pig out and not remember it. I have found that if you take the ambien while you are already laying down it drasticaly reduces the halucinations and weird behavior. For me the benefits have outweighed the side effects by far!! Before I started taking ambien I was lucky to sleep every other night now I sleep everynight. I have not had any withdrawl symptoms if I don't take it every night. Maybee not a great idea if you live alone because of the potential for dangerous behavior_ but for severe insomnia it is a lifesaver. Just make sure you are in bed when you take it.,F,32,2  years,4/24/2009,Ambien

541, 4, severe insomnia,Memory loss at any dose_ odd behavior at higher doses,This drug is safe IF TAKEN EXACTLY AS PRESCRIBED.

I have been taking this drug for about two years now since developing severe insomnia and couldn't function without it. (I am still planning on having a sleep study done but right now can't afford the time off work.) This medication will cause memory loss even at low doses_ which isn't a problem because you should be asleep. Always go to bed right after taking it. If you don't_ you may do things you don't remember_ but generally_ these things won't really be all that odd except at higher doses_ in which case you may do things you would never do normally_ like drive down to the nearest Dairy Queen and order three large Blizzards_ or order $1_000 worth of worthless merchandise online. NEVER combine this drug with alcohol in an attempt to increase its potency. You will wake up two days later with no recollection of the previous day and spend the next several days trying to explain to people why you called them in the middle of the night.,M,27,2  years,4/20/2009,Ambien

If I stay awake_ as everyone else has mentioned_ I experience anterograde amnesia_ behavioural changes_ vivid visual hallucinations_ etc. Upon withdrawal there are unusual dreams.,Ambien is one of the most amazing medications I've ever taken. The side effects only manifest if I stay awake after taking the pill. I take 10mg a night_ which usually gets me around 4-6 hours of sleep_ which is impressive to me.

The bad for me does not outweigh the good...yet. For falling asleep_ nothing is better. However_ it is strangely addictive and psychological dependence develops in a matter of days. If you're going to use it_ use it very sparingly. If you have trouble falling asleep every night_ try alternating it with something else. You do NOT want to get hooked on this drug.

I would like to know if this particular drug causes memory loss in general--like kill off your brain cells memory loss? I have been experiencing and noticing in teh last 5-6 months that my memory as a whole seems to just be radically changed. I pride myself or should I say used to pride myself on having a great memory. Lately though I have dropped in IQ instantly.

If you take an Ambien and continue to stay awake_ walk around the house or surf the net you are bound to experience some of them. Words on the computer will start to bend_ objects in your house will seem to float up towards the ceiling. It can make you think that objects are people staring at you. It can also make you feel like the ""life of the party"" and makes you want to start cooking and eating. The real danger is when people get into their cars and want to go shopping. Driving on Ambien will get you a DUI!   I have found that Ambien CR keeps me asleep longer and have since switched.

I slept ok_ but not great... not as well as on the previous drug. However_ since I only take ambien occasionall_ I have become aware of the side affects the next day... I'm usually paranoid and anxious_ with a side of depressed... It's happened too often now to be considered coincidental.,I tried Ambien on the advice of a KIA (know it all) at my work.

571, 1, insomnia for at least 10 years,Things that should be in my memory are like_ not there. I've been BFFs with my girlz since junior high and I totally trust them with my life!!! But what happened one night made me realize anything can happen_ even when people you trust are there. One night we got in pretty late_ so I took an Ambien and jumped in the shower. Now tonight I've been reading some of what people have posted and I've gotta say to those of you who don't believe the bad stuff; I was just like you before_ but not anymore. I totally love the way it makes me sleep_ just not the scary stuff. So back to what I was saying...,I got out of the shower and to my surprise_ there were some guys at our apartment. One of my girlfriends had given one of them her cell and he called her while I was in the shower. I know what your thinking; it's after midnight_ it's a booty call_ but we were just hanging out_ talking and listening to some music. That's the last thing I remember until I woke up the next day. I ended up hooking up with one of the guys_ which is totally not like me. He was still in my bed when I woke up and I feel really bad for him_ cuz I started screaming and freaking out when I saw him. But my girlfriends came in and calmed me down. They told me that I was acting normal_ not like being drunk or anything_ when I went to my room with him. So now I have been officially off of Ambien for two weeks. It's really hard to sleep but I'll manage without the Ambien for now. At least until I get a serious boyfriend_ then I'll probably take it when he's there. Hee Hee :),F,25,2  years,2/12/2009,Ambien

No addictive effect.When I no longer needed help falling and staying asleep due to stress_ I began to take them on days that I worked swing shifts (3-11 one day_ 7-3 the next).

The problem is it can be a bit addicting.  When you first take it you will be out in less than 30 minutes.  But if you continue to take it it will start to lose its effect.

So I called her the next morning and said I don't really remember calling you or what I said_ but whatever i said to you disregard it cuz i was on Ambien. I also fooled around with my baby's dad brother. I would never do this sober. It made me even have feelings for him while I was taking this. It makes me alot nicer though. I also was emailing people and mis spelling alot of words. I also wrote in my journal and read it the next morning_ and it made no sense at all.

It worked for about 1-2 weeks and then after that did nothing but keep me up all night long. The next side affect I experinced was visuals. Things crawling in my bathroom floor_ the walls moving_ etc. This made it even harder to go to sleep. After that the worst symptom I had was the feeling I might not wake up in the morning. My chest would feel very tight and hard to breath. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE!!!! Valium works much better!,Now when I take it I dont go to bed until 3am.

I have often had the hallucinations others mention_ such as conversations going on around me when I'm in a room alone_ objects seeming to dance around...I usually take this an hour or so before bed_ because it often takes that long to kick in. I've tried many sleep meds and Ambien is the most effective for my long-term use. I don't have any hang-over effects the next day. However_ once a month or so (no rhyme or reason to the timing)_ it just doesn't seem to work with just the 10mg. dose_ so I take another half or even whole pill.

I would not always have the sleepwalking/sleepeating episodes_ maybe only 3-4 times a year? I notice that the 10mg tends to cause more sleep walking and the 5mg has no side effects at all.

I would then only take the medicine right before i went to sleep and made sure my phone was off and away so i wouldnt pick it up and call/text someone. When I did begin to get tired i heard music in my head.. I knew no one else could hear it but it was beautiful_ amazing music.. many times it was classical music but nothing I recognized.  I felt like I was on some sort of shrooms.  The feeling was comforting at night but it was scaring in the morning to not remember anything i had done an hour or so before falling asleep- much like a black out from alcohol- sometimes i could remember little parts of what i had done if someone reminded me.. Also_ I was only able to sleep 5 or 6 hours at most and was then very tired duringthe afternoon.

My boyfriend thought I was completely crazy. A few days ago I took my pill as normal. I became very aggressive_ demanding sex and acting a like fool. I went in the front yard completely naked. Went back in the house and was throwing everything in sight... After an hour of this I finally feel asleep. This is completely out of character. The next morning I woke up like nothing happened. I had no memory of any of this. After he told me I was so embarrassed about my actions. On a different occasion I washed my white clothes with a red shirt and turned everything pink. I was so puzzled the next day not remembering a thing. I thought my boyfriend did it. Another time I got up in the middle of the night and cooked noodles and the next morning I went in the kitchen and the stove was still with black noodles in the pot.

My boyfriend did have some concerns because of the things that he sees have happened on ambien that I don't remember. But I made it clear that this is the most wonderful thing in my life for sleeping_ and I will continue to use it. Because I need to sleep. People who sleep fine do not understand how difficult and exhausting life can be.To manage_ my boyfriend and I have come up with an agreement. I never take ambien when I am alone. I only take it after my boyfriend comes home from work at night. I always always tell him right after I've taken it_ so he can make sure that I don't do anything dangerous.

619, 1, Chronic Insomnia,Hunger_ lack of concentration_ severe addiction_ abuse,"10 years ago I was hospitalized for depression. I had not slept well in years and was prescribed 5mg while in the hospital. My Dr prescribed 30 tablets_ one month at a time for 3 months. I started seeing him every 3 months and was given a prescription for 30 and 2 refills for 7 years with reduced effectiveness over time. Switched to Trazadone for 2 months which made my skin crawl_ made me dizzy_ nauseus and it took a huge dose to keep me asleep_ leaving me with a tremendous ""hangover"" effect.Dr put me back on Ambien. When I first started taking Ambien_ a prescription for 30 was around $35. Over the years it sky-rocketed in price. With no medical insurance it became tough to pay for. My tolerance for Ambien grew and I slept less and less. When Ambien CR came out I switched to that. It was tough to get to sleep on CR but I slept longer. As you know if you take it_ it cost close to $200 per month without insurance. Couldn't do that long so I went back to regular Ambien. I convin",M,50,10  years,11/20/2008Email,Ambien

If I take the pill_ and don't immediately get into bed_ I have a tendency to feel very drunk/high and spacey. Once in bed_ I have experienced mild hallucinations (nothing nightmarish_ just odd subjects wander through my mind) and my body feels really weird and heavy. I find I have to remind myself that I'm in bed_ trying to sleep_ and I will feel fine in the morning. Then I'm asleep for the entire night. In the morning after taking Ambien_ I tend to feel sort of foggy for the 30-45 minutes I take to shower and get ready_ but then it clears up after that and I feel great all day.,Although there are some side effects that I experience with this drug_ I still think it works great as a sleep aid. I definitely recommend taking this drug only once you are in bed_ ready to sleep.

It has taken me 7 months but I have finally figured out that this has caused depression.  I have thought that my husband was cheating on me when he wasn't and started getting concerned every time he talked to a female.  I have NEVER been like that in my life.  I have always been confident and carefree.  In the past 7 months I have been less confident and worry about many little things that were effecting my daily life.

Now the 5 mg dose no longer overcomes my bladder spasms as effectively and I have been waking 3-4 times/night_ but I still fall asleep quickly and generally go back to sleep easily.

660, 4, insomnia,It keeps you awake if you have had ANYTHING to drink any time even during the day. It gives a good quality sleep_ but only lasts about 6 hours.,You have to use 'reverse engineering' to figure out what time to take this medication. Figure out what time you need to be up in the morning_ then count backwards 6-7 hours_ and take the pill at that time. Trust me_ six hours is all you're gonna get_ so don't take it at ten unless you want to be up at four in the morning...you'll be wide awake and feeling nicely rested though! It's too expensive I think.,F,56,10  months,9/11/2008Email,Ambien

I have no idea what happened.  Im glad I found this website because after waking up in different clothes and searching for my car keys for about 30 mins today I am going to find another sleep aid maybe back to the OTC sleep help.,,F,42,1  weeks,9/9/2008,Ambien
663, 4, unable to sleep-anxiety,groggy in the morning... but I believe that it gave me severe tenitus ( ringing in the ears)... I have stopped taking it and I think the ringing is less... anyone else with this side effect?,"In the past I have ""sleeped walked and driven""... very scary stuff.. have to get 7 1/2 - 8 hrs. I did love the sleep part... it worked!",F,56,6  months,9/6/2008,Ambien
664, 1, Could not sleep at night,Side effects became quite severe.  My body is in constant motion all night long leaving me exhausted in the morning.  I have woke up outside sitting on my deck in the middle of the night.  I have been on the telephone ordering items off the television.  I received 4 expensive books in the mail and was billed for it.  I called the telephone number on the bill and explained that I did not order the books.  They let me listen to a recorded message which_ in fact_ was my voice.  It was very scary to listen to myself and to hear me giving out my credit card number.  I wake up with food have eaten in my mouth unaware of what I am doing.  I have sent out E-mails and spoke on the telephone without being aware of it.  My husband and children say that it is very confusing to tell when I am really awake or when I am really asleep.  They also say I become argumentative when they try to redirect me to bed.  Just two nights ago I fell asleep in the bath tub with the water running.  My husband did no,I would not recommend this drug to anyone.  I will never take Ambien again.  I did not take it for the first time last night.  I am exhausted today and feel anxious.  My body feels weak and I am dizzy.  I do want you all to know that I did have three sleep studies and have been under the care of neurologists for over 15 years.  Taking Ambien wasn't a flash decision.  Please be very careful in deciding to take this drug.,F,53,7  years,9/6/2008,Ambien
665, 4, insomnia from back/neck pain,Learned quickly to disable all methods of communication prior to taking it.  Turn off the phone_ hide the car keys_ turn off the computer_ lock the doors and put away my money and GO TO BED.  I woke up in front of the TV one morning in my t-shirt and panties surrounded by Wal-Mart bags_ my purse open and $300 gone.  Did I just shop nearly nude?  No.  I had given my son money and a Christms list with no memory of having done this.  I have had lengthy telephone conversations with no ideo what was said (probably loving-love everybody on this stuff).  I have obligated myself to events I can't physically fulfill due to my chronic pain condition_ but I felt good at the time I was called upon because I had just taken my ambien.  I clean my house around 3 a.m. as it relieves my pain_ but pain is much worse the next day.  I just bought a bunch of dresses on E-Bay that aren't my size.  TAKE THIS MED AND GO TO BED or better yet GO TO BED AND TAKE THIS MED.,The round lavendar pills worked really well for me_ but then began to cause increased pain.  There was another one that was a skinny white oblong pill that made me ill-very ill.  I just tried the brand that has the 54-553 imprint on a round whtie pill and I am feeling nothing-no drowsiness & no crazy feeling.... well except feeling like I wasted my money and will be up all night.  Don't take this during the daytime and don't drink with it either.  Be responsible.  I wish the CR wasn't so expensive because it worked better for sleep_ but the kick of la la land leading to sleep wasn't there with the CR.

WELL. after i took it_ i was talking online and my laptop screen started changing. it was like i was staring through the screen into another world_ where i was walking around the side of a mountain. i couldn't even see my instant messaging boxes because they kept moving and i was just so confused and trying to concentrate on the mountain. it hurt my eyes so bad that i just threw the computer on the floor. after that_ i layed in bed and i started hearing voices (which was actually the tv) and i thought it was coming from the pants and hairbrush that were on my bed. i all of a sudden got this random idea that i was an egyptian queen  and the pants and the hairbrush",F,18,4  days,9/4/2008,Ambien
668, 3, Couldn't sleep_ on Zoloft,It appears that_ although I've only taken Ambien a few times_ last night I opened the garage door (which I always check before going to bed because of bears) and MAY have driven_ although I don't think so. I've been off a regular sleep schedule ever since we came back from Australia for 10 months. I never would have known about this except my husband asked me this morning if I opened the garage door. I said no. I didn't talk to my daughter until this evening and she said she HAD NOT opened the garage door (she's 24 so this was not a teenager trying to escape). I do remember dreaming (once I went to sleep) that I couldn't find my car...I thought it had been stolen.So_ unless there was some kind of electrical problem (and then why not open the other garage door?) I was sleepwalking.This has scared the bejeezus out of me. Ambien DOES help me sleep but it takes a long time to take effect. As of tonight_ NO MORE AMBIEN.If I'm asleep and driving a car (!!!)

Lately (2 yrs now) I am getting severe headaches and blurred vision in left eye and on left side of head near my temples & ear lobe.  Had an MRI and 2 opthamologists check me and they do not find anything other than dry eye as a possible cause.  I wonder if the Ambien CR is causing them.  I have not experienced the other effects some people claim (killing your cat_ wild sex_ nightwalking) and think these people must have serious psychologically repressed issues that are unrelated.

Dr. suggested Ambien - I took 5 mg (1/2 of a 10 mg pill) right before bed_ slept 6 to 8 hours straight and felt great the next day. Just knowing I had the ambien to rely on seemed to reduce my stress.

After checking myself into an inpatient psychiatric facility_ I was diagnosed with drug-induced psychosis.  I'm in therapy now to try to get past the event.

The ambien worked fabulous for sleep.  Could sleep through the pain and the nightmares took on a less frightening quality.  Negative side affects;definitely amnesia_ exhausted during the day_ mood swings_ trouble concentrating.  Doing things I would never do while not taking this med.  Emailing_ writing messages_ phone calls that I don't remember making.  This is after I would wake up after falling asleep.  Complete inhibition. Sex with my husband that I do not remember.  Raunchy  sex that made my husband happy_ but really started making my self esteem suffer.  I felt too drugged to argue.  I wish I were joking as I think back to all the things that happened when I took this medication.  When switching to the CR_ thinking perhaps the increased dose would help me stay asleep_ therefore not wake up and do all this stuff (which didn't happen...woke up anyway)_ aft,I always took Ambien as directed_ and didn't drink.  I think as an occasional help to sleep_ this would be ok_ but not chronic like I took it as prescribed by my pain management doctor.  I have now quit taking all Ambien as of 2 weeks ago_ and the withdrawal was agony.  Horrid night sweats_ day chills_ hallucinating_ night terrors (thought my kids and cat were dead one night)_ anxiety through the roof.  Now into the 2nd week of detoxing_ starting to feel better_ and my hair is starting to show signs of regrowth after taking mass vitamin supplements and scalp massage.

I finally went to bed_ laid there for about 15 minutes and felt very nauseated. I got up_ went downstairs into the kitchen and almost power-barfed into the sink.

I switched back to regular generic ambien and have been fine.  I recommend people also try MELATONIN as that is usually what I need to sleep.  You can safely try 1-3 mg (get at health food store) and try.  I use both together.  Also try setting aside time to ""get ready for sleep"" as when I do that_ I use less Ambien.",,,10  years,7/3/2008Email,Ambien

I immediately stopped taking Ambien and within two weeks the body odor was gone. Just to be certain that it was Ambien causing the odor_ I took it again (the next month)for seven days. The body odor returned!  I stopped taking it and haven't had any more problems.  I am glad to be rid of it (both Ambien and body odor).,,F,58,4  years,6/7/2008,Ambien
707, 5, Insomnia,None that I am aware of.  Memory (more like forgetfulness) started going with onset of early monopause...so cannot really blame it on this med. Have had great restful sleep and am dreaming for the first time in many years.  Granted_ some dreams are more vivid than others_ but_ isn't that a side effect of deep sleep?

It is intended to assist in SLEEP. Take it and close your eyes and fall asleep. I sleep for exactly 7.5 hours.  I get up once to go to the bathroom...(one of the other side effects of menopause) then I go directly back to my bed (no detours to the fridge_ or the car.) I am thankful for this medication_ and perhaps dependent on it at this point as on the odd night when I decide not to take one I fall back to the exact same (lack of) sleep pattern that led me to it...,F,50,3  months,6/5/2008,Ambien

711, 1, insomnia partly due to medications,Hideous nightmares. Anxiety bordering on panic attack if I did not fall asleep; this continued during the day.  Horrible palpitations.  Depression.  Feeling crazy.  Stopped sleeping altogether.  No hallucinations_ sleep walking or eating and not much amnesia.  Took it for about 30 days at different doses (prescribed).  Anorexia_ stomach cramps.  Went off it and felt much better in 2 days.  This is a very dangerous drug and according to NIH research_ it does little to enhance sleep (reduces sleep latency by about 13 minutes and lets you sleep tops 1/2 hour longer).  Not worth taking.,This is a potentially dangerous drug for a significant number of people_ judging by these posts and the side effects list.  It is prescribed much too casually.  I do not think it is safer than the traditional benzos  or trazodone.  Should be prescribed more strictly and for no more than 2-4 weeks.,F,52,30  days,5/29/2008,Ambien

It scared me.,I won't stop taking this medication_ I think I will just space out the days I take it.

I can usually sleep with it but I'm usually always up during the night going into the hot tub_ getting something to eat_ or the like. I wish I didn't have to take it especially with the amnesia.

I tried Rozerem and that was horrible.  It kept me awake all night like it was a benzedrene. Have tried all the others: Melatonin_ Valerian Root and two or three more that I can't remember now. Have avoided all the things that are supposed to cause it. Have done all the things that are supposed to help you sleep. Have read all the books & techniques.

The tub came alive and I was so amazed by it I apparently tried to stay under the water to investigate.  My son had to climb in and pull me out.  Eventually my son and wife had to literally carry/drag me to bed.  I could not walk.  Everything (e.g. living carpet_ moving walls_ breathing chair backs_ etc) distracted me.  I have never taken an illegal drug_ but my experience sounded very much like descriptions I have heard of LSD use.",I would never take this drug again.  Other experiences to date: Lunesta helped me sleep VERY well but apparently I had many hallucinations from it as well -- but memory loss so I relied on my wife to fill in the blanks.  I quit it due to the memory loss (not even remembering going to bed).  Switched to Rozerem.  No side effects with Rozerem but they did not help be sleep at all.  Switched to Ambien...

I was near the end of my 30-day prescription and asked the pharmacist if slow heart rate/palpitations were common. She said she had heard of people being very sensitive to Ambien because it ""slows"" your central nervous system. After 4 or 5 days off the drug_ I gradually became myself again.

I have had amnesia from the drug in the past_ but last night (according to my husband) I fell in the bathroom_ then walked out holding a tissue to my arm.  Then I opened a prescription drug container_ spilled it on the floor_ crawled under my bedsheets and fell asleep.  He got out of bed and picked up all of the pills (so our cats wouldn't get hold of them) but put them in a box by my bedside... not their container.  I woke up this morning with scratches on my left arm and a bruised nose.  I found a bloody tissue next to me in bed.  The pills were where he had left them... in a box on my night table. I was (hell_ I still am) confused and scared about what I had woken to because I have NO MEMORY of any of these events.  There is no feeling more terrifying than harming yourself and having no recollection of it.  I am aware that Ambien is not to be taken after consuming alcohol_ and,F,28,12  months,2/19/2008,Ambien

SHopping on the internet and ordering things and not remembering until the next day when something else ""triggers"" my memory.",This drug will help people fall asleep but it's scary to think that you are getting up in the middle of the night and calling people and shopping online and having sex with your spouse_ only not to really remember any of it the next day unless something triggers your memory.

I think a lot of  problems people have with this drug have to do with alcohol or other drugs.  Alcohol in the blood turns to rocket fuel about 3:00 AM_ which I'd say doesn't mix well with Ambien.

After about 2 weeks I ended up in the emergency room when after one of my bouts of confusion and wanting to die_ I tried to take a whole bottle.

It took me over 5 months to sleep normally after stopping the drug.,Very very very very dangerous to take if you have to care for others in the middle of the night_ such as children_ or a sick spouse_ or parent. This drug puts you in a coma so a person is INCAPACITATED and UNABLE to care for others for several hours after taking this dreadful medication.

763, 5, sleep problems due to back pain,Possibly a little short-term memory loss_ but very little.  Groggy on waking if on more than 7.5mg.  Fine if I keep the dose at that amount.,It has been exceedingly helpful with very few side effects.  I take 7.5 mg. immediately before bed.  Sleep well_ and wake sometimes with pain--but can go back to sleep.  Without Ambien_ I can't do that and there is to much pain break-through.  I also take a low dose of Percocet (5mg.) and 10 mg. of diazepam.  This combination has made it possible to sleep well after four back surgeries. The surgeries were successful_ but I knew that they would not totally eliminate pain--and night pain had been an ongoing problem. I don't always get eight hours--but six to six and a half is a lot better than what I got previous to Ambien. Is it addictive?  I don't care.  I have not had to increase the dose_ and I sleep so much better--so maybe the ability to sleep is addictive. You need to take the minimum amount that is effective_ take it immediately before bedtime_ and not experiment with it.,F,65,4  years,2/9/2008,Ambien

I will not increase the dose_ because I am scared abou the side effects of taking 25 mg.  I will switch back to Trazodone.  This drug is not designed for long-term use.  I would strongly advise people to reevaluate taking it_ once it begans to wear off.

767, 1, My fiancee took it for insomnia.,She had serious memory lapses_ episodes of hallucination_ heard conversations that didn't take place_ sent weird emails and made weird phone calls_ got easily confused_ and she seemed to have no attention span.  We would agree on doing something and an hour later she would seemingly have no recollection of the conversation.  She accused me (repeatedly) of leaving the house at night after she was asleep_ having an affair with another woman (the specific woman differed)_ then returning and getting back in bed with her before she woke up.  These episodes took place only on nights she took ambien.  This led to her phoning total strangers and accusing them of being involved with me (as well as several professional acquaintances--to my embarrassment).  Occasionally she would get violent for no apparent reason_ to the point of breaking things she valued.  These antics became worse over time.,At the time_ it never occurred to me that her use of ambien may have been the culprit.  I figured she was coming down with Altzheimer's and I broke off the relationship because of her crazy behavior.  Only recently did my sister suggest that there may have been a pharmacological explanation for her outlandish behavior.Now it's quite possible that ambien wasn't the culprit.  But in retrospect_ she did take it quite frequently--more evenings than not--_ and usually after a glass or two of wine (and she was a little lady_ 116 lb).  Anyway_ I wish I'd considered a possible connection earlier_ so as to at least try to rule it out. My advice: if you have a loved one using this product_ and he or she begins to act weirdly_ check out the possibility that it's the drug that is responsible. ,F,58,10  years,2/5/2008Email,Ambien

I was always telling my kids to be quiet_ and they are not loud kids.  Irritated by the phone ringing_ didn't really want to leave the house to do errands. Realized it all started when I began taking ambien.  I also had terrible achy joints and bones (fibromyalgia type pain).  I did not have bad withdrawal symptoms. If you are sleeping but feel like you are loosing it during the day_ take a close look at the ambien side effects.

My children think it is hilarious to ask me for money when I'm under the influence_ they once got me for $100 for pizza and movies!

She had just completed her PhD in Philosophy_ and was a brilliant academic_ in the prime of her life. She simply left the house one night after taking this drug_ barefoot and wearing her pyjamas_ walked to the Sydney Harbour Bridge_ and jumped to her death.

I wasn't having trouble getting to sleep so it knocked me right out but then I woke up very early around 3:30-4:00.  Although when I awoke I felt perfectly calm and relaxed unlike before so it was OK. I just laid there half asleep and enjoyed the time until my alarm went off at 5:15.

Ambien was a godsend for me_ as I would go weeks sleeping only 2-3 hours per night. I call it the smack-down sleep medicine_ as its effect can be like a sucker punch (not in a bad way-- just know that you might very suddenly fall asleep). As everyone else has said_ TAKE THIS MEDICATION WHEN YOU ARE IN BED. Do not drive. Make sure you are in a safe environment. This has also worked well for relatives. However_ make sure that any elderly relatives 1) are given HALF of a normal dose_ and 2) are not alone and are safe (can increase chance of falls). I switched to Lunesta only because it supposedly preserves the natural structure of sleep_ whereas Ambien alters this. Also_ Lunesta seems to have less morning grogginess-- but a horrible aftertaste and none of the happy feelings. When I switched_ I did not experience ANY withdrawal effects.,F,30,3  years,1/12/2008,Ambien

I am sure I have some addiction to it_ I have discussed my concerns with my doctors several times and they agree that it is OK to continue to take. I slept 2-3 hours a night before starting this med_ all of immediate family have trouble sleeping_ falling asleep and staying asleep. I was waking up every hour on the hour before Ambien. I might wake up 1 time a night now and that is because I have to go to the bathroom. I have had NO problems with this med. I take it AS DIRECTED!!!!,I get so annoyed with people giving Ambien a bad name because they are not following the directions.

I cut_ break or nibble the pills and take the minimum needed to work_ usually about 2.5 mg. I take while in bed. My rule is no oftener than 4 times a month and only if I haven't gone to sleep within an hour of going to bed.

Clearly not everyone reacts to this drug the same way.  It is possible that people who have adverse reactions may be taking too much or taking it incorrectly.

I don't want to have dreams at night.  I want to fall asleep and stay asleep_ in a deep sleep.  I'm on the verge of tears every day.  I feel like I'm losing it.

I always go straight to bed after taking it_ though once I took too long to fall asleep and saw glowing goo on my hands and when I went to write about it on my computer_ the keys were made of carved potato and the windows looked like construction paper. Deliberate attempts to induce hallucinations with ambien failed.,I take it only occasionally_ like a few times a week when I'm studying and need to sleep for finals but never for a whole month during spring break. I always take it when I take adderall. I lie in bed_ not feeling sleepy_ worried that the Ambien isn't going to work_ and then my alarm goes off and it's morning_ or I wake up after 7 hours with no strong urge to return to sleep. I feel well-rested. Ambien never fails to knock me out_ even though sometimes I need to take 2 or 3 and some alcohol to overcome all the amphetamines in my system.,F,23,4  years,12/5/2007,Ambien

This kind of incident is very frightening because it could be life threatening.,Only took it twice out of desperation over a period of about 8 months.

Seems I also got him a $250 remote control_ too!  Never have sleepwalked in my life and it's scarey to find out what you did.  What if I had been driving?!So_ I'm back to Lunesta.

I have tried Sonata (hallucinations and very unrestful and short sleep) and Lunesta (worked well_ but left me a little hung-over feeling) as well.  I have taken Ambien a couple of times per month for the past three years.  It knocks me out within 15 minutes and keeps me to sleep at least 6 hours_ and I wake up feeling refreshed as if I didn't take any sleep aid at all.

856, 1, insomnia,Thank you for this web site. I took ambien for 1 year before I realized Ambien was what was affecting me adversly.  I experienced neurological pain and damage to my feet and hands.  I spent endless hours being tested for everything from rheumatoid arthritis to neuropothy issues including MS. I have now been off ambien - which I did cold turkey - for 6 weeks.  Most of the tingling and burning in my hands and feet are starting to subside.  I also developed a slower thought process and extreme clumsiness - this too is returning after one month. Anxiety was also a side effect.  My peace was missing - stress was taking over. I have not even added up all the expenses and time I have spent on doctor visits and prescriptions.  The pain and heaviness in my legs made it difficult to walk.  My normal life was truly turned upside down.,I would strongly recommend not taking this drug. Any pain_ throbbing_ burning_ pins & needles feeling and anxiety can be side effects. These side effects are not on the pamphlet.,F,54,1  years,8/14/2007,Ambien

If taken  as directed you will fall asleep and stay asleep for about 5 to 7 hours and wake up without any ""hangover"" effect.

860, 1, Insomnia,Extremely poor quality sleep_ it didn't really cause me to feel differently_ good or bad.  I've been more sedated from taking extra xanax.  Next day_ it made me nervous and I was very hyped up.  My teeth would chatter_ and I'd get those weird shakes that weren't from being cold.  I also experienced really bad body aches that lasted for days.  I think it also excaberated my insomnia and anxiety.  I've been taking a lot of klonopin and xanax this week to combat these problems_ with some success.  I've also completely lost my appetite since taking it.,I am taking other medications (lamictal and lexapro)_ so it is possible that my experiences happened because of that.

If I don't go to bed and close my eyes shortly after taking it_ I get mild hallucinations like the walls moving in waves. The amnesia effect is the most alarming_ as I recently ordered a $500 set of self-help tapes by phone yet have no memory of it whatsoever. When the package arrived at my home I thought it was a prank. Had to explain to the company and send them back. I even made them play back the recording of the phone call where I ordered it. The call lasted 15 minutes_ was definitely me - sounding wide awake - and I don't remember ever having said a word of it. That's scary stuff.,"This is the only effective sleeping aid I've ever taken. Totally dependable_ unlike several other popular prescription sleep aids which did not work at all for me. I get no ""hangover"" or tiredness the next day. In an emergency_ it is possible for me to override the sleeping effect and stay totally awake all night_ which I've had to do a couple of times_ once when my cat was seriously injured and had to be taken to emergency_ and once when my mom was taken to emergency_ both of these incidents occurring just after I took Ambien. In those cases_ there was no amnesia effect whatsoever because I was so intent on concentrating on what was going on_ and I had to remain alert to provide information_ so with deliberate effort it is possible to stay awake and alert after taking it. I would have given Ambien a 5 rating for being so effective_ but I'm deducting one point due to the problem of occasionally doing things you don't remember and had no intention of doing.

This example scared me to death.  I took it one night and I guess my husband woke me up by snoring.  I got up and turned all the lights on in the room and set up a video camera to tape my husband snoring.  All while in a zombie state.  So the next day I decide to watch the tape to see if I can see if my eyes are open or not.  I couldn't tell but WHAT I DID SEE was me crawl back in bed_ open up the Ambien bottle and TAKE MORE PILLS !!!  So I counted my pills.  I had gotten 30 10mg pills 2 days earlier.

Its when I really need it that the side effects are most severe and I never take it unless I have an entire 8 hours to sleep. It works really well but its chemistry seems to be very unstable. Do not take it with alcohol. If you are chemically sensitive even the slightest change in diet and exercise can change ambien's effects. Most important: Turn off the computer. Hide the cell phone. Luckily I live with an immediate family member who loves me and has a sense of humor. I have taken an ambien (10mg)just before bed when I still have laundry to do but no intentions of finishing.

I prefer to have more control over my body and my mind_ even while asleep_ especially with little children in the house.  I'm certain the dosage was probably too high for me_ but I didnt even want to bother with a lower dosage.  I went to my doctor right away and got something else for my anxiety and to help me sleep.  Its definitely a good drug for sleeping and probably not dangerous if taken responsibly and with great care and education.  But it,I agree with other writers that there should be more information_ more public awareness about the potential side effects and dangers of this popular drug_ especially possible sexual side effects_ the hypnotic-hallucinogenic effects_ especially after reading other reports on this site.

I can function now during the day.  My fibromyalgia is much better when I sleep well and ambien allows me to do this.  It takes 30 min - 1 hour to work...

Supposedly one is not supposed to have withdrawal with Ambien_ but I did.  I was a wreck.  I had horrible rebound insomnia.  I could not go to work by the end of the week.  I was hallucinating.  I was sweating and shaking.  I am glad this medicine is out of my system now.  I will never_ ever_ take it again.,This drug did help me fall asleep initially_ but the effect wore off fast.

Went downstairs and took a shower ""to go to church"". This lasted for about 2.5 hours. He wanted to drive to the store- I took the keys and cell phone and hid them and stayed awake to make sure he didn't hurt himself.

959, 5, Insomnia,Same as mentioned in prevous post.,This is a very good drug in helping with insomnia.  If Lunesta is the mouse_ Ambien is the elephant when it comes to sleep aids.  REMEMBER:  If you get used to it and think you can take it before you drive home then you will be ready to go to bed DON'T.  If you get pulled over one look at your pupils and you are in jail with a DUI.  Your prescription will not save you.  Do not carry the meds with you they should stay home or safely in your overnight bag. Do not use this drug recreationally_ it is worse than alcohol and you will buy more trouble than you can imagine_ an oh yeah_ not remember it.

Your good sense goes to sleep so don't go shopping_ drive_ or stay up you can get hurt or worse_ hurt others.,Needed help to sleep because I traveled a great deal and the anti-depressants do not help in the sleep department.  Dose was 20/mg per night for sleep.  Worked great for first 8 years same dose. Mixing alcohol - big no no you get the bad dreams_ hangover etc. even with 1-2 oz. of alcohol.     Past 2 years I only net about 4 hours of sleep with this dose.  When your life changes after 10 years so should your meds_ if you still need them that is. Try lowering your dose_ sometimes less is more. TAKE IT AS DIRECTED BE IN BED AND TAKE IT.  If you take it even 20 minutes before you go to bed you can seriously hurt yourself_ start a fire_ slip and fall - your automatic sensors shut off.  DO NOT shop while on this medication or you will spend yourself into negative balances.  Your good sense has already gone to sleep even though you are not in bed.

I've taken this med ""as needed"" for years.  It really works- good sleep aid.   You definitely need to time it right or you'll be sluggish and sleepy the next day. It also causes forgetfulness the next day.  It also raises libido- but you can't remember anything about it in the morning.

I also awoke one morning and found that I'd eaten 6 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches over night.  Finding crumbs and other tell-tale signs of eating during the night became common.

I took it and my husband 'babysat' me because I was afraid of the side effects.  After I had taken it a while_ we realized that nothing bad or weird was going to happen so we relaxed the 'babysitting'.   A couple of times I took it and didnt go to sleep right away_ and ended up having sex with my husband and I had some reallly freaky hallucinations.  I have to say they were very pleasant.  One time_ I had an argument with my husband and I ended up driving off in my car.  He didnt realize I had taken it and  didnt realize  the danger.

This usually works within an hour tops.,I know there are lots of bad opinions about this stuff but I personally love it. If taken correctly and for the right reasons it works perfectly. No yucky hangover_ no bad taste in the mouth (Lunesta)_ no premature waking (Restoril). AmbienCR did not seem to work for me_ took longer to work and seemed more like Lunesta without the bad taste in the mouth.

I remember telling him about this while at the same time realizing that what I was saying sounded insane. I have done a lot of the things people have described here_ phone calls_ night walking_ shopping online_ which was horrifying because I woke up the next day and had to come up with the money to pay for everything I didn't even remember buying.

Also_ my boyfriend tells me I say mean things to him during the night of which I have no memory.  Just recently I kicked him out and woke up in the middle of the night and wondered where he was.  When I called him at his place I asked him why he left.  He said you told me to go home.  I HAD NO MEMORY OF THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION.  I am switching to something else.,F,44,2  years,1/8/2007,Ambien

I generally am awake for about an hour after taking it_ and find no hallucinations per se.  However_ I do get very unsteady when I stand up (I usually just watch tv or read until I fall asleep after taking it) and I have done many things that I don't remember at all the next day.  Other things I remember but they're really clouded.  Nothing out of the ordinary_ though_ just forget them.  My husband will say I did something and I'll go O_O I did?  Whoops.  I never go out though_ or try to do housework or anything of that nature.  And to my knowledge_ it's not made me do anything sexually I wouldn't normally do.  I have had some very vivid sexual dreams_ though - which I'm not complaining about LOL  I have noticed an increase in my masturbation habits_ however I can't honestly say it's solely from the ambien.,F,41,6  months,1/4/2007,Ambien

It's not an unpleasurable feeling_ as long as you don't have to work or deal wth the kids.,It's changed my life. I worry_ though_ that I take it when I should really be trying to establish better sleep patterns by more regular bed times and so forth. Beucase it's a pill it's too easy.

I have never before had any kind of anxiety/depression in my life and this was definitely medication-induced.So if Ambien is giving you any of these feelings (that you didn't have before) I would suggest checking with your Dr to see if these might be side effects and all you need is is a little relaxant (half an hour before bedtime) to relieve any worries about getting off to sleep.

I have been taking it for over a year_ and I noticed one day when I did not take it things were calmer in my classroom. I stopped taking it and have noticed I am much calmer around my 7th graders.,I totally experienced the calls and emails to other people_ who later told me I sounded drunk. Never thought I would Ambien dial. I also talked irrationally on a transcontential flight after taking it- so beware.,F,39,1  years,11/6/2006,Ambien
1040, 2, Insomnia,Last night I took 1 Ambien and within about 20 minutes_ I was hallucinating.  I was on the phone with a friend while it all occured.  Had I not had someone on the phone talking me through it and talking me into getting into bed_ I don't know what I would have done.  It was very scary & unexplained until I read this website.  I have taken Ambien on several occassions over the past 5 or so years and never had this happen.  Be careful.,,F,36, ,11/6/2006Email,Ambien

Then one very terrible experience when taking it earlier in the evening with one glass of wine and dinner_ when I fell asleep briefly_ woke with a jolt_ then apparently caught a taxi to my ex-partner's home and acted out_ resulting in being arrested. I am a 46 year old woman_ who has never ever done anything remotely aggressive_ never acted out in any way_ and in fact hate any confrontational experience.,I threw out this medication the next day. I am ashamed and humiliated and cannot bring myself to tell any of my friends. Fortunately_ I have spoken to medical colleagues who have related other stories about this medication - the one thing in common seems to be that it should not be taken by people who have significant levels of stress or depression as it can cause a automatism type reaction_ and that apart from the sheer embarrassment_ can lead to more serious consequences. This medication should be prescribed with much greater caution.,F,46,2  months,11/2/2006Email,Ambien

1046, 2, insomnia,Sleepwalking_ drug trip-like actions_ altered personality_ loss of  rational thought,Was on Ambien for a couple of years.  In the beginning the drug acted quickly and I was able to take as recommended_ in bed.  After several months_ drug stopped taking effect so quickly_ and I would brush teeth_ shower and do other getting ready for bed things before retiring.  Occasionally would regale roomate with one act performances of Medea_ or theories of life or other nonsensical antics.  We thought it was amusing_ until she was away for the night and I went outside and sat in our front yard talking to myself for hours.  A kind neighbor helped me back.  Went to bed several times without locking the doors.  Extremely perilous to take if you live alone_ or are in charge of children or pets.

1049, 5, insomnia,Disoriented_ dizzy_ sleepy which is not really a side effect_ but the expected result. Calling it a side effect is like saying insulin lowering your blood sugar is a side effect.,This medication is great. I am able to get to sleep quickly and sleep well_ feeling rested the next day. For the most part_ people on here do not use any common sense or take charge of their health. It's like any drug_ if you have bad side effects_ stop taking it and look at alternatives.  If you find yourself doing unsafe things_ then use some intelligence and go see your doctor.  If you keep taking this drug and you know you are reacting badly and do nothing about it_ you get what you deserve.  There are many alternatives to ambien_ so don't put it down and wreck it for those of us who use it successfully.  Again_ use your head and go see your doctor if you have bad side effects.

1050, 1, Insomnia,Not really remembering you should take it as soon as you want to go to sleep_ I took it with my dinner and a glass of wine. And that's when the trouble started. I remember missing my ex and suddenly having to call him and tell him that_ even though I hadn't talked to him for months. I left what I thought was a message on his voicemail - later looked at my phone and found I had left several. Anyway_ then I lay down in front of the tele-feeling nice and mellow. About half an hour later_ I woke with a jolt and found my hand in a chicken sandwich. I suddenly 'had to see my ex_ so although I don't remember it_ got dressed (into something I would NEVER wear normally and my knickers on backwards and inside out) and got a cab (dont remember that). But then_ the problem really started...,because I have now been charged with break and enter. I did some stupid things-not major damage_ but I sort of remember doing them but felt totally disconnected at the time and strangely calm. But worse still_ I was arrested. I am in my 40s_ and have NEVER behaved in any way like this before. I am so stressed and humiliated -I wish I had never ever been prescribed that drug. I can see it might be fun if you had someone to supervise you_ but beware playing with it on your own. The penalty can be high. I have to pay for the damage and have to pay court costs_ legal fees_ etc. And I feel so ashamed_ I can't tell anyone. And my ex doesn't know I was on medication for insomnia related to depression - he must think I am a total nutter and i can't tell him because I'm not allowed to contact him to explain.

Ambien does help considerably.  Sometimes it does take about a half hour to an hour to take effect_ but usually I fall asleep in less than a half hour (and often much sooner).  I do sometimes wake up during the night_ but am able to get back to sleep quickly.

I have taken 10mg each night for two years.  If I do not take it one night I cannot fall asleep; which is why I started it in the first place.  I still wake up maybe once but do fall back asleep.

Approximately consuming twenty five pills.  I woke up the next day in the hospital in the psychiatric ward. I do suffer from depression_ but it has never been so extreme that I would ever think of harming myself. I was completely unaware of my actions and was shocked to be in the hospital_ and embarrassed. My roommate told me I tried putting makeup on our cats and I did other unusual things. I would not recommend this drug. As ridiculous as my comment sounds_ it was true.

For example_ people say it causes amnesia_ well you are supposed to be in bed after taking the medication_ not cleaning the house.,This medication changed my whole life. Insomnia was ruining my family life_ school_ work_ it was horrible. Been on it for a little over 2 years now_ and I was able to go back to school (nursing school). Does NOT effect my memory what so ever and does not make me sleepy during the day.,F,34,2  years,8/19/2006,Ambien
1087, 2, insomnia,I originally rated this higher but have since discovered that it is the cause of significant intestinal problems. Even at 5mg my stomach feels like it is all shakey and the last time I took 10mg my whole body felt like a bowl of jello inside and my wrists were so weak I could not type. It takes about 3 days to get back to completely normal. I had suspected it but it never was that bad till I took it the other night and then the next day took my regular meds(Nexium_ Avelox and Prednisone for infection) and in a couple hours I almost had to go to ER as I thought I might be having a stroke then realized it was the Ambien. Took some Pepto and it started to subside. It is a very weird feeling as my hand don't shake just feel like everything is going at top speed but pulse rate is not high. It does make me sleep well though but will have to give it up. I never took more than twice a week.,,F,70, ,8/15/2006,Ambien

I woke up about 4 hours later_ with an empty bag of pastries ( which was new_ I know for a fact)  I had in the pantry_ in front of me. All the pastries where gone. The sofa was full of crumbles_ as well as the floor and my clothes. The kitchen counter had more crumbs_ plus traits of the fumble I had to open the bag_ which was tightly closed. For a moment_ I thought somebody was inside my home. I had no recollection whatsoever of the bulging. I also took my pc and placed it by the sofa_ but I did not write anything_ as some of the stories in this site.This has been one of the scariest and weirdiest experiences of my life_ being completely out of control of my actions and not remembering a thing.,,F,43,3  days,8/7/2006,Ambien

1091, 1, insomnia,Paranoia_ severe depression_ hallucinations.  I almost killed myself because I started fighting with my evil twin in the mirror and started choking him but it was me I was choking. Then I thought that aliens were coming out of my closet so I tried jumping out of my 3rd floor window but then it turned into a jail cell and I was stuck inside but then my fingers turned into snakes and started biting me all over. I'm in Ohio and I tried to get to Arizona for some antidote for the snakes biting me. That didn't work.,On my way to Arizona I felt like I was on the moon bouncing in low gravity. Then suddenly I was in my bathroom and Andrew Jackson (twenty dollar bill) came out of the tub and tried to eat me. I ran to my bedroom and realized that I was in touch with everyone on the planet and I could see the collective consciousness of the whole world.

My prescriber never told me that ambien worked immediatley. so because i took it a half hour before bed i experienced major diorientation and a panic attak. I had no sense of direction. I didnt know where i was_ and i was disoriented. soon after_ i could contol this feeling and i learned to like the feeling i recieved if i didnt go to bed right after taking it. i craved the disoriented ""high"" feeling. Because i would only take it within an hour before bed i got loopy and pleasurably disoriented and then put myself to bed. i eventually was tkaing 25 mg before bed.

1095, 1, Recreational,I was cooking dinner and having cocktails with my cousin Abby and her sister Sara's husband Jeff. Sara was out for the night with girlfriends and Abby and I thought we'd help Jeff put the kids to bed and hang out for the night. Jeff has chronic backpain as well as insomnia and takes Ambien as well as other pain medication regularly. After about 2 or 3 cocktails Jeff suggested that Abby and I have and Ambien with our drinks. He said it would only intensify the effects of the alcohol and that he does it all the time. Abby and I were a little wary at first_ being that neither of us used prescription drugs for fun before. Then Abby suggested that we split one. The pill was so small I figured it wouldn't do much but get me drunk quicker. Since I was already feeling buzzed I was a lot more willing than I would probably be sober. Then Jeff_ Abby_ and I went out on the back deck_ smoked some cigarettes and chatted. I remember the conversation well and it was pretty normal. Then it started to g,which I would always answer and I had missed calls as of 10 oclock_ one being from my boyfriend who I'd never refuse to pick up for. So I'm hoping I passed out shortly after being on the front porch. So after I woke up I hopped in my car and went back to Abby's where I was staying. I go to her room and she said that she was tripping out and never made it back until Sara called her to come down the street at 11:30. She said it was all pretty fuzzy to her and she wasnt much help to them.  Apparently_ Jeff and I had broken some glasses and we were found passed out on the living room carpet. Sara was pretty upset_ rightfully so. Especially since we were left responsible for the kids_ and we were anything but responsible. So after Abby told me all this_ I went to my room and went back to sleep b/c it was way too early to try to figure this all out. There's a bit more to it_ but basically_ I have no recollection of those few hours and it freaks me out.,F,25,1  days,7/20/2006,Ambien

Maybe twice a week and I take when I get into bed only. IT IS A SLEEPING PILL. I beleive that my stomach problems over the last 9 months are somewhat related to Ambien use as it started after I got out of hospital for something unrelated and they gave me Ambien for sleep abaout a year ago. since then I have had numerous tests for stomach problems and diagnosed with IBS. Seem to be symptom free now except when I take the Ambien I have minor distress.  Bad nausea originally during night  but now it is only minimal.  I need my sleep and without something I can lie there all night long awake regardless of how busy and how tired I am when I go to bed. A double edged sword.

After three days of taking Ambien she did not fall asleep_ rather began to hallucinate that there were people in her room scarring her_ including images of the devil. She also saw people doing various activities in paintings and believed that loved ones in photographs were talking to her. She suffered great anxiety trying to understand why she was the only seeing these people and became defensive and angry when we tried to console her. This was a terrible experience for her_ especially when the medication was suppose to help her get rest after trying to emotionally deal with the recurrance of her cancer.,I think people should be very careful in using this drug.

But_ like others have said_ you need to take it and get into bed right away.  It's for sleeping_ not for recreation.  I need about 15 to 20 mg of ambien to get a good night's rest.  Sometimes I'll wake up in the middle of the night and have to take another dose.  But_ I get great_ deep_ restful sleep with no hangover effect.  Just hope my body doesn't get more and more aclimated to the drug so it won't totally loose it's effectiveness.  My doctor has me on sonata right now (my first night) and it pales in comparison to ambien.  I've taken over 20 mg of the stuff over 5 hrs ago and still wide away.  I wish I had my ambien right now.

I switched to lunesta which helped me get off the ambient but gave me worse side effects. Now I am off both (thank god),My doctor gave me an open ended script for this med. I took it every night for about a year. The sever memory problems did not start until after 6 months of use. I used to chew it up to make it work faster because I started reacting slower to it.  The slower reaction time left me in bed for half an hour waiting for this stuff to work and sometimes I would get bored and get up and start cleaning or eating or having sex(under the influence) ..This drug WILL make you sleep like a baby (I slept better than I ever have in my life on this stuff) and having sex on it is great if you can remember it in the morning.

I had eaten just an hour before and had hard time sleeping_ although must admit that halucinations of the room morphing and the bed flying around (whle I was on it) was entertaining... and a bit disturbing.  Since then_ I have taken it only 5 more times in last month or so and it seems to be a consistent side effect_ but   I don't really mind the mini-trip that seems to last about an hour before I fall asleep.,Asside from the side effects immediately following taking it_ the overall functionality is great!  I wake up feeling like a million bucks... (can't say this about the illicit stuff I took as a youngster).

I was ok while I was on the medication_ maybe more irritable and angry_ but the first night after not taking Ambien_ I was a complete and utter wreck.  I have never had such strong thoughts of wanting to commit suicide in my life.  The side effects from dealing with the dependence of this medication are very uncomfortable.  Also_ every night I took the drug_ I would hallucinate before I fell asleep.  I had grand euphoric emotions and all my problems would be solved in my head.  Eventually I grew tolerant to the medication and would wake up hallucinating.  One night in particular_ I got out of bed and spoke to a friend on the phone.  The next day I spoke to that friend and had no recollection of the night before.  Dangerous drug in my opinion.

1129, 2, insomnia (trouble staying asleep),rebound insomnia,I've never had a probem FALLING asleep_ only STAYING asleep longer than 3 hours.  The first night I took Ambien CR 12.5 mg I slept 7 hrs straight (a success)_ but I noticed the next night (before taking a pill) I was really wired--lots of nervous energy--DEFINITELY coud not have fallen asleep on my own.  I took it again and was able to sleep relatively well.  Took it for a total of 5 nights with progressively lessening benefit and then tried to go without.  OMG!  First night it took me 5 hrs trying to sleep_ and then I only slept 2.5 measley hours--way worse than BEFORE I tried Ambien.  Second night w/out meds was a little better--slept 5 hrs straight.  Third night no meds got a total of 7 hrs (in 3 segments).  Still feel a little of that nervous_ toe-tapping energy.  Won't ever take Ambien again.HelenHouston_ TX,F,50,5  days,6/1/2006,Ambien
1130, 1, Insomnia,No side effects until I just wuit one day,I was taking 1/2 of 10mg for 3 months.  My dumb-a$$ doctor failed to tell me that treatment should be as needed or for a period of 7-10 days.  I got a script for 30 days PLUS 2 refills. I took it every night and one day decided I didn't need it and I had the worst withdrawal - it made Paxil withdrawal look like a walk in the part.  Parathesia_ severe anxiety_ crying jags_ involuntary movement followed for months.  Be careful with this one!,F,30,3  months,6/1/2006,Ambien
1131, 4, Chronic Insomnia- Cause Unknown,After a while I built up a tolerance.  Sometimes taking a few days off will help the medicine be more effective again.  When tolerance happens I don't fall asleep right away_ even if I am in bed trying.  Usually I keep myself in bed and watch a movie 'til I pass out.  I ALWAYS eat at bedtime now because it makes me hungry- I bring a small pile of healthy snacks into my room so I don't go crazy and eat everything in the kitchen.  Poor judgement- such as taking extra medicine I didn't need (it's guarded by a family member now).  Hallucinations- nothing too scary_ things just appear to be moving/dancing_ I know they really aren't so it doesn't bother me.  Memory loss only while under the effects_ sometimes I retain partial memories (it's like remembering a dream) and other times I completely forget things I've done or conversations.  I now feel I am dependent on Ambien_ but nothing else has worked for me- behavior changes_ natural remedies_ or other prescriptions.  Most others I've tried,Not being able to sleep was hurting all aspects of my life.  Ambien is the only medication that has worked effectively for me (I've tried natural remedies_ and almost every other sleep medication there is including drugs not designed specifically for sleep treatment).  Be aware that you can become dependent on this medication!  Try taking short breaks from it if you are taking it long term and feel it not working as well_ rather than up your dosage.  Also_ do everything you can to be in bed when you take it and stay there to avoid doing foolish things you won't remember the next day... if you share your home with others_ ask them to watch you for strange behaviors and they can help keep you out of trouble.  I dislike the side effects of Ambien and I wish my insomnia were less severe or that other medicine without these side effects would be enough... however even with all the negative aspects_ I have found ways to deal with the side effects_ and thanks to Ambien I can actually sleep!,F,23,9  months,5/27/2006,Ambien

I never remember any of these things in the morning_ and only find the evidence in my email out box_ or find out from what people tell me later.,It works really well for sleep.  I take it_ sleep soundly for 4 hours_ then wake up completely refreshed.  But if something happens to wake me up during those 4 hours_ like my daughter crying or my wife wakes me_ then I am confused_ disoriented_ and likely to discover in the morning that I did/said crazy things.,M,40,2  years,5/25/2006,Ambien

I live at the beach and have always been accustomed to riding my bike to the beach in the heat.  Today_ I experienced dizziness_ weakness in my legs and trouble breathing.  The only other time I have ever experienced these symptoms was 2 years ago when I took Wellbutrin.  When I suspected Wellbutrin was the culprit and stopped taking it_ all the symptoms disappeared within 2 weeks.  I have been taking Ambien about 3 weeks and am willing to have insomnia to no longer have hallucinations and this weakness while riding my bike.  Be careful with this drug.

1136, 5, Insomnia,You can all see my first post with the quesuenas@yahoo.com on the right of the screen for further commentary.  It should be five comments under this post.  Ben sent me an e-mail and thought everyone else should know the detail Im telling Ben.  Im www.myspace.com/carnaldesire in the first post as well.5 mg usually does the job.  10 mg is a guaranteed knock of my insomnia and that is something great to be said since you have to consider my insomnia is the type that will keep me up all night long; until Ambien came around.  The stuff is a God send unless you take it and drive.  You're looking at ending in the grave from falling asleep doing that.  While it does guarantee sleep_ its usually completely out of my system within 4 hrs.  After 4 hours_ there are no side effects at all.  The stuff hits with power and completely disappears out of your system like it was never there.  If you've ever taken diphenhydramine_ you may have noticed that tiredness and other effec,after you take Ambien because you might go into shock from all the wrong keys you hit in what you were doing.  I do NOT know what people are talking about with hallucinations.  They must be abusing Ambien.  I hear abusers inject the stuff in mega dose. I believe the effects they have by abusing it are true based on the knock out effect it has on me.  Problem is_ I'm not awake long enough to tell you about the effect.  It hits then its lights out without time to contemplate all that stuff that people are talking about.  At higher doses_ I would be out too fast to anything that wasnt there or maybe for a minute before waking up without much to remember.Important point with Ambien is that you need to take it on an empty stomach for the knock out effect.  Take it with food and you take away a fast route to sleep.  It's just like alcohol_ Cialus_ Viagra in that the effectiveness is ruined or dissipated with food.

1161, 1, My father was...I was not,The other day I heard a discussion on the radio about Ambien and things started sounding familiar. Even though the side effects discussed were serious. People were joking about it. I don't see anything funny about it. My father who passed away last year of inoperable lung cancer was given a low dose of Ambien when diagnosed. He would be up all night and sleep all day. He would put a movie the the VCR during the day (when not on Ambien) and be asleep by the time the titles at the beginning of the movie stopped and the movie started. Then he'd be up all night. About 2 years ago my father fell out of bed and hurt his head and arm. We thought he must have been having a nightmare (he'd never fallen out of bed in his adult life). Then it happened again 6 mo later and he split his head open on a bed table next to the bed...very dangerous when also on blood thinners.,I heard about hallucinations...my father thought the hospital he was in was on fire and was begging to get out of the bed and know the way out of the hospital. He could not stand anything on him...clothes_ sheets_ leg wrappings to help with circulation. In the hospital he told us to bring back a little girl who had been in to see him_ but I never left the hospital room the whole time my father was in the hospital and there never was a little girl. At home when he was dying he would mumble a lot. Sometimes a little made sense and sometimes it did not. One time I asked him what he was doing. He said praying that they do not kill his family.

1163, 1, Insomnia,THIS DRUG SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY REMOVED FROM THE MARKET! IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS! I took 10 mg of zolpidem recently and tried to commit suicide by jumping out my window. I can completely understand and associate with what others have said on here. I experienced all these things people are saying: seeing imaginary people_ obscene hallucinations_ suicidal feelings_ nausea_ extremely bizarre behaviour_ sleep-walking... all from one tablet! I have never tried to kill myself before and hope I never will again but I was CLOSE the other night. The only thing that saved me was the fact that I couldn't squeeze out my window. I was walking around my flat naked and muttering to the invisible people who were detaining me. It's now some days later and I'm still struggling to spell words and to concentrate. If you take this drug_ YOU ARE RISKING YOUR LIFE! You have been warned.,How this drug is still on the market is beyond me. The company must have reports and realise that many people are having suicidal thoughts and experiencing other disturbing behaviour from standard doses of the drug. Sure_ most people are fine with it but reading through this damning list of comments_ it's clear that what happened to me was not some fluke effect. To those who have written on here that the people who are complaining are doing something wrong_ how can you say this? I've read of at least one person who's taken their life having ingested this drug. This is serious stuff folks. I'm going to write to the company asking if they are aware of how many people have committed suicide having taken zolpidem. This is a disgrace in modern medicine.,M,25,7  days,3/12/2006,Ambien

1166, 5, Fibromyalgia/Insomnia,First let me say it's very unfair the way some people on this forum are calling others dumb and drug addicts. I've never abused drugs in my life. The side effects of Ambien_ and there are loads_ can happen even if you don't eat 1 to 2 hours before and lie down right away.  If something. Anything keeps you awake. Say an itch or hive breakout which I've had. or an upset stomach and trip to bathroom... suddenly you're on a different plane with no inhibitions WHATSOEVER. It really is quite scary. I don't find the things I've done on Ambien FUN. And yes the court cases are on their way. I can't believe it hasn't happened yet. I live alone. I can't imagine what I might do or say to another person if they were there with me when this stuff hits.,It can work for a good night's sleep but there are definite dangers with it. I've often thought If I have a child I would definitely have to stop taking it because you simply don't know what you might do on it which includes ANYTHING imaginable.,F,38,6  years,3/10/2006,Ambien

I actually take it once I'm in bed.  I will fall asleep for a short while and then get up_ either to do things I don't remember or hallucinate.  My partner has observed this for years now_ but neither of us connected it to the Ambien.  The side effect info does not place enough emphasis on these side effects.  My memory loss extends to my non-sleeping hours as well_ I'm very forgetful now_ which is frustrating_ making more irritable than the Ambien already makes me.  I take one 10mg tablet nightly.  Fortunately_ I don't go outside of the house and have never tried to get in the car.  But I have prepared food using knives_ all the while alseep and unaware.

My partner often tried to direct me back to bed_ but said I would get very agitated and angry.  I wasn't sure I believed him.

I told him that there were people in here all staring at me and angry-like. the water bottle was bending over to look at me. the laundry bags became people and the bed was shaking a lot. he said it sounded like I was on drugs. needless to say he is worried and does not want me to take this anymore. but I slept a solid 8 hours each time I took this and felt,"I laughed so much over the ""ambien date"" comment a few reviews down.

You are in a altered state of conciousness while the drug is in effect.  Any memory while on the drug will be lost in your mind.  Doesn't make me tired at all_ just somehow makes falling asleep easy.,Only works for me if I take about 40mg.  I have taken up to 60mg_ but found it to be just as effective as 40mg.

I am tapering off of ativan( only half of the pill) and I am taking half an ambien(5mg) at night. I do wake up about every 4 hours. I am afraid to take a whole ambien because I am still on ativan.

When I finally stopped  cold-turkey using Ambien I could barely sleep at all for over 2 months.  I had other horrible withdrawl symptoms which among them were: the shakes_ moaning_ horrible anxiety_ depression and constant ear-ringing.  I could barely leave my house for several months.  While I took the drug I was a whole different person-very mean and angry.  Sonata and Lunesta work in a similar way. Please think twice before using Ambien.  There are many natural alternatives to prescription sleep meds.  (Although they won't work well until Ambien is totally out of your system which can take MANY months). Hospital emergency rooms see many Ambien-addicted people. It is being sold as a street drug and people are crushing and snorting it. The only positive thing I can say about Ambien is that it must have done something to rev up my metabolism because I lost and kept off 20 pounds easily when using it.,F,40,2  years,12/6/2005,Ambien
1207, 4, insomnia due to meds/back pain,Immediate tiredness and loss of memory if I didn't go to sleep right away.  when i combined it with wellbutrin (to quit smoking) it added to depression and memory loss during daytime.  without taking wellbutrin_ it worked fine,definately helped me sleep.  i never had a problem sleeping before but am now on percoset and kadian for back problems_ which kept me awake at night (along with the back pain).  the doc started me with one 10mg a night_ but i was waking up at 3am.  the doc then said to take one 10mg at night and another 10mg at 3am (20mg in all) and it seemed to work fine.  I never felt groggy in the morning and got my 8 hours of sleep.  my insurance company would not pay for a refill (limit of 60 10mgs in 90 days) so i stopped taking it and there was no withdrawl symptoms besides back to not sleeping very well.

I want to alert people to the long-term effects I've experienced. I've taken Ambien every night for 5 years. Started out with 5 mg_ then went up to 10 mg_ now back to 5 mg. For several years I've noticed deteriorating cognitive skills - memory loss_ attention deficit_ concentration_ mental alertness_ processing information. This has concerned me_ but I have continued to take Ambien because it does put me to sleep. For the last 2 months I have experienced light-headedness and fogginess on an almost constant basis. It makes it very difficult to function day-to-day. I've had a number of tests done because I thought it was ear-related. Not so.

I never took a sleeping pill before and made sure I asked both the dr and pharmacist about the side effects. They both told me that it will cause dizziness_ drowsiness_ to make sure I have at least 8 hours to rest and that I should start feeling something in 15 - 30 mins. I wasnt sure what the effects would be so I decided that Id try taking it on a full stomach first. I knew that if anything it would take or should take longer to affect me.  I took one pill at 8pm_ and as I was swallowing the pill I thought I'd better use the restroom before it took effect. I was in the restroom for no more than 5 mins and started feeling drunk. I said to my husband_ ""I am not feeling very well_ I think I better go lay down"". It was just a few mins later_ and I was starting to feeling obscenely drunk. I turned to walk out of the room and that was the last I reme",I think it is a DANGEROUS drug_ be very cautious when taking it. Make sure you read ALL the warnings. Ask your pharmacist for the drug insert that comes with the drug so you can read all side effects associated with this drug. Make sure you have a family member or friend there to watch you and make sure you are safe. They really need to explain the side effects more with the doctors/pharmacist and then they should really explain that to the patients to make them aware of what could happen. Just because most people will not have a bad experience doesn't mean that others won't and for that they should advise you of all the effects and let you decide if it's worth taking.  I only took it one time and will never take it again_ not even a half a dose or a quarter of a dose_ nor will I try any other sleeping medications ever again.  It's really frightening to think a drug could have such an affect on people as to make them black out_ producing a drug induced amnesia.,F,37,1  days,11/3/2005,Ambien

I know I am addicted-- I would rather eat an ambien than candy or anything. When I try to stop taking the ambien_ I usually sublimate by eating more_ or drinking alcohol_ which I hate. My family and fiancee say I am more forgetful_ and that I am mean. It lowers inhibitions_ but on the good side-- it often inspires really cool business ideas-- unless I take more than 10mg.

I had definitely developed an addiction to it and couldn't fall asleep at all without it. It was_ however_ a mental addiction - and once I realized that I was falling alseep on my own b/c I'd built up a resistance to the drug_ I quit using it and I'm so glad I did! I still have a prescription for it_ but now I'll only use when I absolutely have to... and I haven't needed it for over a month. The weird/vivid dreams are gone_ and the leg cramps are gone as well.

1225, 2, insomnia,I would not recommend this drug.  When I was described this drug_ I was not told by my doctor about amnesia or hallucinations.  When I got home from the pharmacists_ I took 10mg. to see if I could get some sleep in a late afternoon nap.  I found I could not sleep and decided to go for a walk.  At some point during my walk_ the ambien must have started working because I began to feel very strange and started hallucinating.  It is only in retrospect that I can barely remember what happened because it all seems like a dream_ but I realize now it was not a dream at all.  I walked past a bookstore and there was a big poodle tied up outside to a light post.  I imagined it asking me to take a survey about my opinion of the war in Iraq.  I actually had a conversation with a dog about the war in Iraq.  The owner came out and hurried away with the dog_ but I couldn't understand why at the time.

The longer I am on it_ I'm realizing it is harder to remember what I did before I fell asleep.  Many times I pick up the phone and say things I normally wouldn't.  This is definately the truth med. I tell people things deep in my heart that I normally wouldn't.  Do not drive on this med.  You don't realize the way your acting.

Positive- it knocked me out within 20-30 minutes. I slept better than I ever have/no grogginess_ even with an avg. of only 6 hours sleep/night. Negative- I would do things that I didn't remember the next day. Nothing too extreme_ but I would have conversations with my husband that I couldn't remember_ eat uncontrollably_ trip over furniture_ etc. I learned to go to bed immediately after taking -,F,33,6  months,8/26/2005,Ambien

1242, 5, Insomnia,I've been taking Ambien for almost four weeks_ every night; starting with 10mg.  After one week_ moved to 15mg (a night).  Twice I've taken 20mg.  It generally only creates a sleepy-dreamy euphoric state until I fall asleep_ which generally takes about two hours after taking one (and a half) pills.  On one occasion_ I began to hallucinate and thought a house plant was talking to me and begging me to water/prune it.  At least...I think it was a hallucination!,For about two weeks_ my left hand (middle_ ring_ and pinky fingers) have been almost totally numb and tingly.

1243, 5, depression/stress-induced insomnia,I suffered from absolutely no harmful side effects; the,Doctors expect their patients to follow directions.  Ambien is meant to help you get back on track.  That's why its suggested dosage period is only 7-10 days.  You take it at the same time every night and establish a good sleep cycle.  Then save the rest for the really bad nights.  Everyone's body is different_ so some people's bodies will react negatively_ others positively.  So some may find physical/psychological dependence_ others may not.  Take it as directed_ not to stay awake through.  I took this years ago (on and off for a few weeks at a time_ only a couple nights a week)_ and the times my body did fight the sleep_ the most I got out of it were hilarious e-mails to my best friends and making real sure that my mom noticed how pretty the stairs were.  Like with any drug_ just be smart about it.  Ambien helped me get back on track_ and I had no problems,F,22, ,8/23/2005,Ambien

After about 3 months_ my life changed dramatically- my mood became very somber_ I was tearfull all the time and began to think about suicide.  I was groggy all day and couldn't concentrate or think clearly.  One day I just had this idea that it could be the ambien_ and as soon as I stopped taking it my suicidal thoughts went away.  I was shocked but comforted to see other posts about this reaction.  The tricky part about this effect is that it doesn't occur immediately_ so it may be hard to figure out the cause is the ambien.  I haven't told anyone in my life about these experiences_ but I thought it was really important to get this out to others who might be in a similar situation.,F,30,3  months,8/7/2005,Ambien

I am also a police officer and have seen this used as date rape.  I have seen a woman who was on ambien drive a car over a construction worker_ killing him_ and had no idea what she had done until the next day.  IT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU TO!

1258, 4, Insomnia,None until the last year_ during which I've had almost nightly  anxiety dreams (could be my life and not the Ambien). Very recently_ I've had dizziness during the night if I turn over in bed_ turn my head or get up. Again_ this may not be the Ambien but something else. The dizziness stops after I've been up about fifteen minutes in the morning.,When I first started taking Ambien_ it was a miracle!  I took 5 mg at bedtime_ fell asleep within 30 minutes_ and woke up refreshed_ just like the commercial says!  After years of use_ I typically have to take 10 mg to get to sleep. I still fall asleep quickly_ but wake up all night. It takes me awhile to wake up in the morning.  However_ I haven't found anything else that works at all.,F,54,6  years,6/13/2005,Ambien
1259, 1, Insomnia,Extremely suicidal thoughts and feelings.,This is definitely the scariest medication I have ever taken.  My doctor prescribed it for insomnia in around 1995.  I took it once a month_ and it definitely put me out of commission.  I had to be already in my bed when taking it_ because within 15 minutes_ it was impossible to walk.  I took it sporadically over the next five years_ as needed.  After moving and getting a new GP_ the guy led me to believe that it was OK to use long-term and prescribed it to me like candy.  I think he gave me a prescription for 1/day for 30 days and 5 refills.  In reality_ I didn't take it that much.  I took it probably every other day_ at one point_ for three or four months.I did start taking it more often_ but found it was very addictive.  Also_ I began to feel extremely restive and nervous.  Then it was hard for me to be around people_ I was so anxious.  I'd never felt anything like that before.  Soon I found I was having lots of suicidal thoughts and feelings and even planning how I might do myself in.  My wife started to get really freaked out_ and we wondered if it was Ambien.  I flushed what I had left down the toilet_ and immediately the suicidal stuff subsided and I began to feel like a normal and fairly happy human being again.I flushed what I had down the toilet (that was in 2001).  Just recently_ I second-guessed myself and wondered if it really was the Ambien.  I haven't had it since 2001 until this year (2005).  I took two or three spaced several days apart (my doc again gave me the 5-mo. refill :) ) and began again to have the nervous and depressed feelings I had experienced before.The doctor is freaked out about me having more than a half of a Percocet for my chronic back pain_ but he prescribes this stuff like it's a panacea or something.Please don't take this stuff.  I'd rather not sleep than go through this again.  What actually prompted me to write this_ though_ was a neighbor.  Three days ago I saw a life flight helicopter fly about 50 feet above my house and land near his.  He had just blown his brains out.  Interestingly_ he had also been taking quite a bit of Ambien at the time.,M,39,10  years,6/13/2005,Ambien
1260, 4, insomnia caused by hot flashes,Ambien is a very effective sleeping pill if used for that and only that purpose.  When I took my very first Ambien I experienced horrible_ frightening hallucinations.  I took a 10 mg. pill which my doctor prescribed.  After researching and consulting with my doctor about the drug_ I cut back to 5 mg. or less and the hallucinations and other frightening symptoms were gone.  I went to sleep_ woke up and that was that.  Since that time (one year ago)_ I can now take up to 10 mg. per night without too many negative side effects.  I'd say the one most disturbing ongoing side effect_ though_ is the memory loss that results while I am taking the pill.  The next day I have little recall of anything I might have said or done while taking this pill.,If you are taking other central nervous system depressant drugs such as pain medications or tranquilizers_ then Ambien may not be what you need.  It will sometimes compound the negative,F,50,1  years,6/10/2005,Ambien

But if I really put my mind to it_ after I take the pill_ I will stay in bed and sleep_ and it's the best sleep ever.  I have to think about staying in bed_ and not making a fool of myself as I take the pill_ and as it begins to work_ and then I stay in bed and everythings fine.,,F,58,2  months,5/24/2005,Ambien

1271, 1, sleep problems,I took Ambien off and on for five years_ mostly on.  I developed  joint pain_ muscle ache_ hives_ horrible itching in general_ some daily grogginess (I didn't feel focused)_ clumsiness (fell a few times) and then I had two urinary tract infections within three months and hadn't had any in decades.  I chalked up a lot of these symptoms to allergies and my age - I'm 63.  But_ finally I got smart and googled into,In the beginning Ambien allowed me to sleep 8 hrs. - unheard of for me.

Never feel groggy in the morning after taking it.  As a diabetic_ this little pill is a god send_ especially if I am  feeling foot pain due to my diabetes.  If I wake in the middle of the night_ I can go right back to sleep_ something I couldn't do before.

1273, 5, Fibromyalgia_ migraines_ arthritis_,Ambien works great if you take it as prescribed. Yes you need to take it and go right to bed it is fast acting and if you stay awake you can get hurt it is a halucinagic. I went through a bad time and I would take 4 10mg to start off with then by the next day all 60 would be gone. I would do the weirdest and scariest things_ cooking and forgetting the food was burning on the stove_ burning holes all in my bed_ P.J.'s_ and skin. I would imagine crazy things_ talk crazy_ fight with my Dad and actually clawed him with my nails. My parents said I acted like a drunk in a black-out. After I would take me 2 to 4 and stay awake I would spend the whole day or night being insane and would continue taking the pills till they were all gone. I have even gotten in my car and drove it a couple of times and caused a wreck. I got to like the feeling of not feeling anything that I spent all my money and used all my credit cards to buy the Ambien. I even forged prescriptions and was arrested and was put on probation. It is not a medication to play around with and it is not fun to sit and have a imaginary friend_ see things move or in double vision. The high you get might be like WOW at first but in that state you have no idea what you are going to do_ like take the whole bottle_ burn down the house or get in your car and kill yourself or someone else. So please take it right at the moment you are going to bed_ it has worked as fast as 5 minutes so just put your drink by your bed_ your 1 or 2 pills and take them right before you turn off your light. If taken right and you get at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep you will wake up refreshed with no hangover. Also you don't have withdrawls like you would from Valium. Ambien is short acting_ it does not stay in your system long_ in fact it was originally made for elderly people and was found to be a wonderful sleeping pill. So you don't get any physical withdrawls the only effect you will have to endure is not being able to sleep. The Ambien has been what is making your brain think go to sleep. but without it your brain will have to adjust and it will take time for your natural chemisty to go back to normal. If you have been on it for a long time and you want off or your doctor wants you off of it ask if you can be tapered down so it is not such a shock to your brain. I am sorry I screwed up so bad and abused it_ I do hope that my story will keep people from trying to stay awake on it and see what the high is like. The high is not worth it when you wake up in a cell and have no idea where you are and thought you were home in bed.,Ambien is a wonderful sleep medication for people who suffer from insomnia. It is even great for someone who has stress in their life and every once in awhile they need something to let them relax_ sleep and wake up ready for a new day. I no longer abuse Ambien it has been many many years since I did that. I do take Ambien every night_ I have had many surgeries and I deal with severe pain on a daily basis so Ambien lets my body and my mind relax_ sleep_ dream and not have to worry or feel pain. It is the best sleeping medication on the market and it can be used long term if you take it right. Doctors are told that you can only take it for about a week and not long term_ but I have been taking 20mg everyday for 9 years now and a lot of the women in my chronic pain group also take Ambien everyday and are doing wonderfully on it. I just wish the doctors could see how much it does for our lives and not make it so hard to get. Anyway good luck to all of you_ sweet dreams_ and please don't make the same mistakes I made.

1285, 5, Insomnia - Post Migraine,None,Highly effective_ I almost feel as if I'm pushed down into bed_ when I lay down. I have been using 5-10mg 2-3 times a week for 4-5 years. Superior to Sonata & Halcion. Doesn't seem to lose effectiveness.,M,20,5  years,2/23/2005,Ambien
1286, 3, insomina,none,I have tried many and ambien is the most powerful for getting me to sleep.  Each time I have taken it_ whether it has been 11pm or 2AM_ I fall asleep very quickly and sleep solidly for 5.5 hours_ then I awake feeling pretty aroused but still feeling like I need more sleep. I wish it would make me stay asleep for 8 hours_ but it is definitely better than any other option for really bad nights! I usually take it only once_ have taken it never more than 3 times in a row_ and always as a last resort.,F,30, ,2/19/2005,Ambien
1287, 1, insomnia,I don't take this med _ my mother does and has for several years.  She now has severe confusion_ severe memory loss_ freaks out over the littliest things_ repeats herself often_ tells the same stories or gossip often even after you tell her over and over that she has already told you that_ either angered or cries all the time_ bitter and resentful attitude_ and an altered personality.,Although this med does gives her a good nights sleep_ she has totally changed.  Before the med she was a self sufficient person_ very fun loving and giving person. She was very sharp minded at anything she set her mind to do.  Now it is a nightmare to be around her for any lenght of time.  At one time she had gotten off the med because of lack of funds to buy it for about 2 weeks and in the second week she had become her old self again. As soon as she had the $ to buy her script again and started taking it she was back to being a different person and gets worse month by month.  She comes up with stuff that never happened and never was said and she swears it did_ so by the comments I have read she must have vivid dreams and believes them.  Those of you who are taking this med and believe you are having no effect from it during your daily waking hours may ought to take the consideration of examining yourself or talking with someone close to you to see if you have changed personality wise or memory lapses and such.  I have told my mom these things that have become different about her and she denies them and says she don't care if it is true she would never stop taking Ambien.  Doctors need to read this column and take into consideration of the thing you guys are saying.  I smell a major national lawsuit against this drug in the future.  It maybe good for sleep disorders but it is a dangerous mind altering drug.  My advise is to never take the drug.,F,70, ,2/18/2005,Ambien
1288, 5, Insomnia,Groggy in the morning if I don't get at least 8 hours of sleep.,Almost every post has warned about going to bed immediately after taking this medication and they are all correct. After about a half hour I'm knocked out_ and if someone wakes me I feel like gravity stems from my bed. I often feel as if I'm on a boat and when I move to change positions I grab tightly to the edge of the bed thinking the boat is going to tip. I haven't had any amnesia (at least I don't think so) and do not worry about walking around the house or going outside_ etc. I only take it on weekends because I'm too afraid of being late for work.,F,26,1  years,2/14/2005Email,Ambien

1292, 1, insomnia,ambien did something to my nerves: I got numbness_ wierd tingling sensations in hands and especially pinky fingers_ and 24 hours later my hands started twitching!,I just took ONE ambien to try it out (got one from a family member). It worked great and I slept like a log for 6 hours only I woke up with my arm numb. Thought it was just that I'd slept on it funny but it was something different - hours and hours later my hands were still numb and tingling. When that finally went away it was replaced by muscle twitching_ which seems to be subsiding as the drug leaves my body for good. If you have any sensitivity to prescription drugs DON'T take this - it's very strong stuff. I will never take one ever again.,F,34,1  days,2/6/2005,Ambien
1293, 5, FMS/CMP_ Insomnia,absolutely none_ just sleep!,Until my hysterectomy_ I never knew this drug existed. My gyn gave this to me for one month after_ then dx'd with FMS/CMP_ it was decided that I would be on it for long term therapy. It has saved my life. 10mg nightly. It gives you sleep_ and when you have been up each night of your life while others do that sleep thing..it is a relief. Ambien is a safe medication for chronic insomnia_ especially when other afflictions are involved. The key is a doc who is not paranoid about it!!,F,40,1  days,2/5/2005Email,Ambien

1296, 1, Insomnia due to Fibromyalgia,My doctor prescribed this for me continually for 2 years straight. I did not know it was for occasional use. By the end of the two year cycle I was experiencing severe mood swings which could be characterized as MANIC/DEPRESSIVE Bipolar disorder. I found it very difficult to care for my young children. I also experienced alot of light flashes which are characteristic of retinal detachment. Shortly after stopping Ambien these symptoms went away. So far I have never been tempted to try it again,,F,42,2  years,2/1/2005,Ambien

Have to use the right dose usually half or one third tab.,Ambien has been a lifesaver for me as I take frequent (twice monthly) trips from USA to Asia and must perform clearly on arrival after these 19 hour marathons across 12 time zones. With Ambien_ I can control my sleep so that I get reliably 6-7 solid hours during the trips. And for frequent flyers_ you now what a godsend that is. However_ I try carefully to use the least dose possible and some days_ force myself to not use it_ otherwise_ I'd never get of the ambien treadmill. It has improved my health by ensuring I get adequate sleep under these conditions.  No doubt.,M,57,2  years,1/21/2005,Ambien
1300, 5, bi-polarism,this medicine put me to sleep and kept me asleep as it was supposed to but if i didn't take it and go STRAIGHT to bed_ i did things and said things that i didn't remember the next day.  including eating.  i was sleepy during the day_ but i found that if i reduced my dosage and went straight to bed i had no side effects apart from very vivid bad dreams.,i have to have sleep so i do not slip into a manic bi-polar episode and ambien was the drug that best got me to and kept me asleep.  it works very well as long as it's taken and then you go straight to bed.  make sure you have plenty of time to sleep and you'll get used to the bizarre dreams.,F,33,1  years,1/20/2005Email,Ambien

I haven't had anything weird happen. I take 10mg every night. It worked really well at first but now it isn't as effective. I occasionally stay up hours after taking it.

1312, 4, Waking during night,WARNING to anyone taking this drug.  GO TO BED RIGHT AFTER YOU TAKE IT!!!  Don't stay up.  This drug can cause extreme memory loss if it is taken and you don't go right to bed.  It works extremely quickly_ within 10-15 minutes.  I'm sure it is fine if you have someone with you_ but if you are by yourself you could possibly do something to hurt yourself or someone else and remember absolutely nothing the next day.,This is a very effective sleeping pill_ I have been taking it for several months after seeing my doctor about depression and middle-of-the-night insomnia.  When I first started taking Ambien_ I would go right to sleep_ no problems.  However_ last night I took it very early_ about 4 or 5 in the afternoon because I had a cold and wanted to get some extra sleep so I would feel better for work the next day.  I woke up this morning thinking that I had slept from about 5pm the day before to about 8am this morning.  After I talked to my mom_ I realized that wasn't the case.  According to her_ I had a bowl of soup_ and also some other food after that.  I had a conversation with my family_ but I can tell you nothing about it.  At some point I took a shower and washed my hair_ but this morning my hair had dried and I could not remember if I had washed it or not.  I woke up in clothes that I don't remember changing into_ and I also found something on one of my pillows and on some of my clothes that I could not identify (I later figured out it was the soup that I don't remember eating.)  None of the stuff that I did bothers me; what bothers me is that I don't remember doing ANY of it.  I tried my best this morning to rack my brain and remember eating_ and I just can't.  I woke up this morning thinking that I hadn't eaten anything last night_ and that I had been asleep for a very long time_ which just wasn't the case.  It is scary to think that if someone wasn't watching you_ you could probably get out in a car and drive and really hurt yourself or someone else and have absolutely no memory of it the next day.  I am not knocking Ambien in any way_ I think it is great for insomnia_ but it is much more powerful than people think.  Just be careful!!!  Happy sleeping!,F,25,4  days,11/30/2004,Ambien
1313, 5, sleep problems,I cracked up reading these comments_ as I too can relate to many of the side effects.  Sounds pretty weird_ but can really happen.  Not so much after the first few times.  But it does seem like like I have an invisable friend.  I always get happy after it kicks in_ and that alone can make a person want to continue to take it_ AND I sleep well. If I awaken_I can go back to sleep easily.  I found myself looking forward to the nights that I allow myself to take a pill.  DO NOT take a pill if you think you might make love that night. Oh Boy.  Big mistake.,My doctor fights me on renewing my script as she is real serious about it being addictive_ and I believe it can be_ so I do not take it more than three times a week_ and always break a pill in half.  You should climb right into bed afterwards_ and allow plenty of time for sleep.  My husband has found me in other rooms of the house if I don't lie down right away. And I wouldn't take it if I was alone.  Afraid I will wind up in the pool or naked in my car.   Just be careful.....,F,59,1  days,11/23/2004,Ambien

He then gave me a little bit more when I was released from the hospital.  I used it every once in a while until it ran out_ and I never bothered getting any more.  It was great for helping me fall asleep_ but if I took it any time after 9pm I would either have to sleep really late the next day or I would be tired just about the whole day.,M,29,2  weeks,9/30/2004,Ambien

I would abuse others verbally_ which is not my nature--The latest and scariest was 2 nights ago when I took the med_ went to bed at 9:00 p.m. and next I knew I was in my wrecked car surrounded by paramedics--I was arrested for DUI--I DO NOT DRINK!!! and only have wine for cooking (not cooking wine_ regular wine) in my house (besides my husband's beer_ but I hate that and would never drink it_ tho maybe I did--I surely drank something)  Apparently I got up and from my BAC had 3-4 glasses of wine--or several beers or something---there was a wine bottle in the trash the next a.m. at 4 o'clock after my husband picked me up from jail and brought me home--It appears that I had gone out for cigarettes  I DO NOT SMOKE!!!  There was a pack of non-filter Camels (!!!!!)in my car_ unopened_ brand new--I had $200 cash in my pocket_ no ID_ no purse--I do not remember going anywhere!!!  Thank God I did not have an accident in traffic or hurt someone else or myself-- I came home and threw these pills away!!!!1  Now I have to contend with all the problems associated with a drunk driving charge.

1335, 1, depression-related insomnia,psychosis_ suicidal tendancies_ memory loss_ aggressive behaviour,This drug is called Stilnoct in Europe_ and I took it for a couple of weeks about 7 years ago. It caused the worst experiences of my life_ including complete personality shifts in which I abused family and friends with no recollection of events afterwards. There are 4 days of my life which I absolutely cannot account for. Under the influence of the drug (ie after going to bed and to sleep)_ I got up and drank litres of straight vodka_ was admitted to hospital and attempted suicide twice. It is absolutely terrifying to have no memory of most of these events.

But I know from previous experience that if I get into bed now_ I will fall asleep like a log.,Do not use unless you have to if your problem is moderate.  I only use Ambien as a safeguard if it's like 2:00 AM and I still can't sleep.  Don't spend too much time enjoying the euphoria_ or you might find yourself staying up all night.

1350, 5, paxil caused very shallow sleeping,none,ads say should be only taken 7 - 10 days but doctor figures I will need it for as long as I am on Paxil_  insurance pays for it and it does the trick,M,31,4  months,5/11/2004,Ambien
1351, 4, shoulder pain w/ sleeplessness,none while taking it. Bad nightmares and could not sleep at all when I stopped taking it.,Slept really well_ no drowsiness the next day. No problem until I stopped taking it.,F,38,10  days,5/11/2004,Ambien
1352, 5, initial onset insomnia,Amnesia_ only if I hadn't gotten at least 3 hours of sleep in the first hour of waking or so. Also_ may not remember activities right before falling asleep_ although I seemed to function cognitively fine. NOT a good idea to engage in sexual behaviors after taking Ambien_ for obvious reasons.,Works quickly_ and usually only take half a 10mg. tablet is sufficient_ unless I am really anxious about having to get up early and I am clock watching_ ect. It has been a godsend!!!,F,37,10  years,5/10/2004,Ambien
1353, 5, delayed sleep-onset insomnia,Next-day nausea_ headache_ diarrhea if taken too late at night. Hallucinations and paranoia initially_ passes after a couple of times of taking it.,FABULOUS for delayed-sleep-onset insomnia. It can put me to sleep no matter how anxious I am. Works great if you have 8 hours to sleep after taking it. Forgiving even if you have a bit of alcohol with it. Initially causes paranoia and hallucinations_ so be prepared. That passes after you're used to it. I recommend 5mg rather than 10mg.,F,35,7  years,5/9/2004,Ambien
1354, 5, Insomnia due to Wellbutrin,No side effects,It works great. Sometimes I only take half a pill. No grogginess in morning at all.  I only use as needed though as I've heard it is habit forming.,M,36,2  months,4/12/2004,Ambien
1355, 3, Sleep Deprevation,Mild hallucinations_ nothing else.,About 30 minutes into this while laying in bed I start noticing some odd cloud like formations floating around my room and they seem to be trying to communicate with me. I finally fell asleep after 1 hour  and slept 4 hours straight but woke up feeling wide awake and had trouble getting back to sleep. Gonna try 5mg tonight before bed and if I wake up will take another 5mg. Don't take more than 10mg a day so this may solve problem. sorry to post so soon after one night but don't think your going crazy if you see things for awhile in bed ;),M,36,1  days,4/9/2004,Ambien

1358, 4, insomnia,Addictive_ in that sleeping is even more difficult when the drug is not taken.  Vivid_ frightening nightmares when medication is stopped.  If I don't sleep within 30 minutes after taking Ambien_ I (reportedly) function normally_ but have no memory of anything I say or do while it's in my system.,,M,51,2  years,2/6/2004,Ambien

1360, 5, sleep problems,when awakened by loud noises once and got up_ I was extremely dizzy_ disoriented_ laughed almost uncontrollably_ and hallucinated (bedspread and rugs appeared to be levitating).,now I take only 1/2_ and take it very sporadically_ only when absolutely necessary.  Never more than 4 nights in a row.,F,53,5  months,12/12/2003,Ambien
1361, 3, Insomnia,None,It does help me get to sleep_ but the sleep is only good for about 4 hours and I'm awake again. Taking a plain Tylenol along with the Ambien will usually get me an extra hour or two of sleep. 6 hours sleep via the above is about the best I've been able to do since 1994. Every now and then I go into a two hour cycle: sleep two hours_ awake two hours_ sleep two hours_ awake ... that's when I resort to the Ambien and if necessary the Ambien/plain Tylenol combination for a couple of nights. Taking Ambien every night for slightly better than two weeks didn't produce any better results_ just the 4 hours_ so I only take it on occasion now as mentioned above.,F,61,44  times,11/30/2003,Ambien
