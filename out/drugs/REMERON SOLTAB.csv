0, 5, Psychosis_ Insomnia,Apathy_ high triglyceride levels_ vivid dreams_ prolonged nighttime erection.,I started taking this after suffering a psychosis caused by an antibiotic (clarithromycin). Remeron is the only medicine that allowed me to regain an almost natural sleep. It put a stop to the paranoia_ the auditory hallucinations and the general anxiety. In retrospect it probably saved my life. I started with 15 MG at bedtime. The side effects will hit you first (deep sleep_ vivid dreams_ general apathy) but most of them go away after a couple of months. The general apathy is the most annoying side effect but I'd rather have that than the confused restless state I was in prior to taking Remeron. I'm not out of the wood yet but at least I see a light at the end of the tunnel. Another side effect is that my triglyceride levels have trebled so I have to take another drug to control that (I take something called Artechol_ which is some kind of natural statin_ it works pretty well without side effects).,M,43,2  years15 MG 1X D,6/15/2016EmailHistory,Remeron soltab

2, 2, Depression,I was never disappointed in the drug until I stopped taking it.  It has some severe withdrawal symptoms.  I stopped taking it because my GP more or less told me to; some recent blood tests indicated my liver was under strain and he thinks remeron is the likely culprit.  I do not drink or take other drugs_ so I think he is likely right.  Anyhow_ since I stopped taking it_ I only sleep one REM cycle and then wake up wired at 3-4 in the morning.  It's making for some pretty weird days.  I also have a constant headache.  The withdrawal symptons only strengthen my resolve to stop taking it.  I don't think I am actually depressed or in danger of reverting to some unstable state.  I was teenager that was getting into trouble when I started taking it.  I was an unstable teenage_ but 15 years later I'm a pretty stable person_ I don't think I need this medication and am sorry I took it for so long_ but quitting it is going to be much harder than I thought.  People need their sleep.,,M,34,15  years7.5 1X D,3/9/2012Email,Remeron soltab
3, 1, Depression/anxiety,Not 100% sure how long i was taking it_ meds have ruined my memory a bit.  Vivid/erradic/relistic dreams_ stopped taking it a year or so ago (i think) and still have the problem. Makes waking up incredibly hard_ as if it's hard to adjust to this reality after spending so much time in another_ wake up with unclear mind_ no concentration etc,I can't make a judgment if you should take it_ but i will say i deeply regret ever having touched this medicine_ ruined my life ever since taking it,M,23,2  months15mg(1tab) 1X D,12/22/2011Email,Remeron soltab

11, 5, Depression_ anxiety_ insomnia,"not just restless legs -I called it ""restless body"" Cannot take the medicine at bedtime as directed. Although I do feel very sleepy after taking it_ I cannot rest because of the irresitble muscle urges in my abdomninal muscles and legs. Makes me quite sleepy for about 1 hour after taking. Increased appetite- have gained about 10 pounds in 3 months.","I was prescribed this drug after a period of suicidal ideation (probably from high dose of Neurontin_ which I started taking for pain.) It took a while for remeron to kick in with me but I feel almost back to my normal self. i still do experience pain_ but it is not as intense and I don't ""care about it"" or obsess on it the way I did before. So remeron has helped me cut back on my pain medication significantly. I also do not need any sleeping aide or tranquilizer any more. I am very satisfied with Remeron. I take one in the morning (which my doc thinks is weird) and one while I'm fixing dinner. cannot take at bedtime due to the AWFUL restless ""everything"" it gives me.",F,51,90  days15 mg 2X D,5/13/2010,Remeron soltab
