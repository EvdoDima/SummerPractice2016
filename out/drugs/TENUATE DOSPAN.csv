3, 5, Weight loss,None at first_ but later got headaches,I have taken tenuate on an off for several years. i had no side effects for years and weight just fell off steadily_ but the last time I started back on it_ I experienced headaches. I still feel like tenuate is the easiest_ quickest way to lose weight_ but the weight will return once you stop taking it if you aren't careful about what you eat.

9, 4, Weight loss for daughters wedding,No side effects but also no energy,Trying to loose 30-40 lbs before daughters wedding In Oct. Really praying these things work. Won't get on the scale unless my cloths seem to get more loose. I've alway enjoyed  a very healthy/conscious meal and I usually eat 1-2 meals a day. Problem is_ I've had surgeries_ neck and spine surgeries (5) and I couldn't do an exercise if you held a gun to my head. Any other suggestions on how I can ensure weight loss even though I can hardly move sometimes. Like I said_ I've only been on them for a week_ I'm just worried they won't work for me and my daughters wedding is the most important thing in the world to me.,F,49,1  weeks25 mg 3X D,3/19/2014Email,Tenuate dospan

11, 2, Weight Loss,I've taken these pills on and off for 15 years. I began taking them at my jerk doctor's advice when I was 21 years old. A short time later I ended up with bulimia. This drug taught me to like hunger pangs. This drug caused mood swings that worsen as I stopped then began taking it_ pain and swelling down my left arm_ confusion_ mild hallucinations (corner of your eye phenomenon)_ depression_ anxiety_ and more recently heart palpitations that can last for months. I am not a fan of doctors who so eagerly give these drugs to patients. The weight loss is temporary. The eating disorders are longer lasting and potentially more dangerous to your health.,Beware of diet pills. While tenuate dospan has been around for a long time_ the last thing you want to do is become part of a trial for some that have resulted in death (Phen fen_ Meridia).,F,36,15  years75 MG 1X D,2/14/2014Email,Tenuate dospan

14, 4, weight loss,Increased energy & focus (but no exhileration)_ decreased appetite. First few days was about psychological hunger & habits when not actually hungry. Last few days have been about no hunger feelings. Take early as possible (6-7am) & a very light breakfast....an apple at lunch & a child portion of food in evening (which is more than enough)  with masses of water in between has resulted in 5lb weight loss in 1wk.  I have not exercised so I should imagine this will be more if I do. Craved chocolate in the evenings but overcame this. Easter lunch was the biggest hurdle where I had traditional veggies piled high. I have had diarrhoea (manageable) throughout week & today the veggie binge has given me tummy ache that is related to the runs. I was 16s 7lb on 25/03/2013 & on 31/3/13 I weighed 16s 2lb. In an estimated projection_it will take 12weeks to lose 4 stone & get down to my former weight of 12s 6lbs.Although this isnt as superskinny_it is a weight where I look & feel amazing. Im gonna do it. Good luck guys x,,F,32,1  weeks25mg x3 da,4/1/2013Email,Tenuate dospan

This encouraged me to go to the gym and start walking.  I can't wait to weigh myself again.   Work colleagues asked me if I had lost weight after three days!  I eat less and  I am able to think about what I want to eat and when.  My sweet tooth has gone and I haven't drank Coke for 11 days_ which is a record for me.  I tried some chocolate yesterday and it tasted bitter.  I worry that when I cease taking the drug the pounds will pile back on.  I need to learn how to eat more healthier.

55, 5, Weight Loss,At first a little lightheaded and very thirsty_ but this disappeared after about a couple of weeks. Occasional restlessness.,After being diagnosed with hypothyroidism_ I felt depressed because of all the weight I had gained.  I went to the doctor's office to see about participating in a weight loss program.  The doctor prescribed tenuate as it would not interact with my synthroid medication.  I went to the doctor's office once a month to have my blood pressure monitored and have had no adverse affects.  I have now been on Tenuate for 5 months and have lost 30 pounds.  I was placed on a 1200 calorie diet and am eating healthy again.  Tenuate really suppresses my appetite and has curbed my cravings for sugar.  I feel so much better about myself and know that I couldn't have done it without the help of tenuate.  Let me tell you_ if you have a thyroid problem_ it is next to impossible to lose weight!

I stopped taking them because I realised the potential addiction.,My doctor prescribed 3 tablets a day_ which was impossible for me to tolerate. Just half a tab was enough to stem my appetite and give me energy_ but I think they should be re-introduced for weight loss_ providing careful examinations are given to patients first. I took this medication during the 80's until they were withdrawn.,F,51,6  days,7/5/2006,Tenuate dospan
58, 3, weight loss,dry mouth_ little depression_ dehydrated from lack of water intake_ slowly losing weight,i have been taking tenuate for 3mnths now and have lost 6kgs_while it has helped with my eating habits and cravings_ it also helps me feel more alive in the early hours of the morning when i start work.On the other hand if sit down too long i start feeling depressed_ it doesnt give u an excellrated energy boost and if u dont drink enough water u get server dehydrated symptoms and constipation.The comments i get about my weight loss give me a boost and i have even dropped a dress size_but u know u haven't put the hard effort in to lose the weight and keep it off.,F,23,3  months,3/26/2006,Tenuate dospan

71, 5, To lose weight,I felt much more motivated to stick to my diet.,I was prescribed this in the early 80s and lost a little over 30 pounds. I was considered borderline diabetic and told to lose weight. I took the medicine and watched what I ate. I considered it very successful. I put the weight back on several years later when I quit being careful what I ate. I've thought about using it again and went to the internet to see if it had any bad side effects.,M,,2  months,10/31/2004,Tenuate dospan
