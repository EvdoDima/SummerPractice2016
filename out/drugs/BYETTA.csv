6, 4, Diabetic 2,A little constipation. Feeling full earlier than normal when eating.,Dropped insulin to start Byetta. Appears to have really stabilised BSLs - rarely above 10 and fasting about 8. Looking forward to 10 units when Endo gives green light. Hope to stay off insulin. Downside was going from 1 injection to 2 per day. No other real issues + no weight loss or gain. Positive experience so far.,M,49,8  days5 2X D,7/23/2013Email,Byetta
7, 2, Diabetes 2,It somewhat controls appetite however the pain in my legs is not worth the appetite control. I didn't realize it was from the byetta and I went to multiple docs trying to figure out the problem. Then my dad said maybe its that medicine ur on so I stopped it and the pain started to go away.

9, 4, diabetes type 2,Nausea for the first couple of months as we ramped up my dosage.  Not as bad as morning sickness from pregnancies.  It went away.  I have other symptoms_ but really_ I'm going through menopause and some family trauma.  I don't feel as though I can blame Byetta for my body that is struggling.,I noticed a big difference in how full I felt from the beginning.  It helped tremendously with my blood sugar.  Now my A1C is in the 5.4  range_ before about 6.2  I have dropped 20 lbs.  There are times it feels less effective_ so I go off of it for 3/4 days_ then start again.

No nausea even at the start.,In tandem with a couple of major changes to how I worked my diet which has given me much more control in splitting up calories per day and a much more varied diet_ Byetta has led to me losing 6 stone over 7 months after 30 years of failure.

12, 1, Type II Diabetes,My husband started taking Byetta and was in heaven because he lost 40 lbs that insulin put on him. He plateaud and went crazy trying to lose more weight. He eats all junk food and high fat _ high carb meals and then starves himself and eats Adkins Bars and shakes. He has lost all his friends_ he is acting abnormal_ has an obcession with weight loss. He is almost 49 and I am afraid he will kill himself on Byetta! He litterally has lost his mind! All he thinks about is weight loss_ shaving all the hair off his body and buying new clothes_ from 38_ to 36 to 34 inch waist and says he is going to keep losing weight. His hair is thinning on his head. he is out of control with spending money and running us into debt. I called his doctor and told the office nurse he was eating all junk food and playing a dangerous game with this drug and the dim wit told him he could lose 16 more pounds! He is killing himself and ruining our lives_ marriage and hurting our children.,It makes people lose their minds!!!,M,49,1.5  years 2X D,8/18/2012Email,Byetta

I also had daily heartburn and nausea and kept antacids closeby. A month ago i went to 10mg since blood sugar #s were going up and am having a much better experience. I've figured out that if I don't each much in quantity at a meal_ I have no heartburn/nausea and great #s.

16, 4, Diabetes II,Get lethargic if I eat too many carbs_ but now that I figured that out_ I have more energy than the last 6 months.  My stomach sometimes gets a little jumpy_ but none of the naseau which is the most typical side effect.  I have had several bouts of diarhea_ which can be linked directly to eating too many carbs/too high fat carbs for dinner.  Appetite has been interesting.  I go through long periods of not being hungry at all_ then instantly hungry.  Then a little bit of food_ and I am full again.  Blood sugars in a more controlled range (was averaging 200_ down to 150 in first week).  Have periods of intense warmth_ usually after eating.  Slight increase in rosacea_ but I had that prior to this drug already.  Well worth a shot twice a day for these kinds of results.

The smell and taste right when i take the injection bothers me.,It's hard to deal with at times_ and i resent the fact that im 18 and have to do this but it could be worse because It definitely beats Metformin. I can tell when i don't eat right. I'm definitely getting used to what it does to my body. It's nothing i can't live with. It's been the best medicine i've tried for my PCOS (and i've tried metformin_ glumetza_ and actos) even though i get sick 8 out of 10 times i take it_ over all im happy with it.,F,18,2  months10mcg 2X D,3/28/2011Email,Byetta

41, 5, PCOS,The number one side effect that I had instantly was feeling tired_ weak_sicl to my stomach and at times vomitting without warning.I did notice that my sense of smell went to the roof. I could smell things that noone else could. Almost like a pregnant woman.  When I first started Byetta in Feb of this year the first two to three weeks were horrible. I talked to my GYN and said to take tums and if needed take Zofran for my stomach. After the medicine got used to my body_ the side effects went away and was able to eat an hour prior to a meal_ without problems. If you go off your dose for a while_ you experience the side effects all over again. That's mainly why I took so long to get back in the groove of things.,Since February of 2010 I have lost 70lbs. I have PCOS and the Byetta helps a lot with my body making too much insulin. And since I have been taking Byetta I noticed I haven't had as much woman problems. The weight factor is awesome_ just another perk. But I love the way the medicine works with my PCOS. I love Byetta! (Once the side effects are gone by week 3),F,23, 10 mg 2X D,11/3/2010,Byetta

60, 3, Type 2,Nausea_ sever vomiting_ sleepiness.,As a long term user of Byetta I have tried just about everything in terms of controlling the side effects. With respect to nausea/vomiting_ I have found eating a low carb (i.e._ less than 30 carbs per meal) diet works best. I have eaten bacon_ eggs and cheese (i.e._ high fat) for breakfast many times without any impact_ so fat doesn't seem to be a problem for me. However_ if I eat more than 30 or so carbs the nausea starts. One key point that I have noticed is to minimize the swings in my high - low glucose readings. All in all_ follow a typical Type 2 diabetic diet regime_ low carb....and things seem to fall in place.I have not found any correlation with respect to the extreme sleepiness I get some mornings. I thought it may have been low glucose levels_ so I tested and typically am in the 140 - 160 range when it happens. Still trying to figure it out.,M,52,4  years10 mcg 2X D,5/8/2010Email,Byetta

After 1 month_ I went to 10 mcg and was okay for a few months--but after a couple of months starting vomiting about once every week and a half.  It would be just one session_ but 4-6 episodes for that session.  There were some things that I couldn't eat--cured meats_ beef--just the thought of them made me feel sick.  I asked my doctor to switch me back to 5 mcg_ and the nausea is gone. I have lost about 20 lbs on Byetta_ but lost about 20 before starting.  My A1C went from 8.7 to 6.6 in less than one year_ so I was very happy with that.,While Byetta is not perfect_ I feel that it helps me stay in control and gives me hope and help for weight loss and healthy eating.

106, 4, Diabetes Type II,Nausea_ shakey_ excessive sweating_ dizziness_ hot flashes.  Initially started on 5 mcg 2X day_ after 1 week went up to 10 mcg 2x day.  5 mcg side effects were tolerable_ but 10 mcg 2x day are remarkably more severe...am figuring out that eating immediately afterward dosing lessens side effects dramatically.  Have lost appetite_ losing weight_ bs levels are dropping dramatically.  Just have to get used to side effects.  Very scary at first_ as I thought I was having panic/anxiety attacks.  DO NOT drive after dosing without eating....you will get dizzy within 30 minutes.,,M,49,3  weeks,6/14/2009Email,Byetta
107, 5, Type II Diabetes,The main problem is the nausea.  I've tried adjusting my times and found that eating directly after taking the injection helps.  I experimenting with different foods just now_ firstly cutting out dairy.  Does anyone have suggestions for breakfast as toast_ cereal and fruit are no good....,My BM's are fantastic.....my consultant suggested that I reduce the byetta to combat the nausea but i'd rather stick it out and look at what i eat instead.

I went from having BS routinely in the 300's (and often in the 400 range) to now having my diabetes completely under control.  My fasting BS is always at the 90ish mark and NEVER do I have a BS over 150 -- even after eating.  I do have low BS from time to time which was a new experience for me -- last night I had a 44.  AND THE WEIGHT LOSS?!?!? Wow!  I have been taking Byetta for about 9 months and lost 50 pounds -- I have a total weight loss for the last year of 67 pounds. Would I recommend Byetta?

This time I'm back to the 5 pen and it seems somewhat better. Still have some nausea_ but not as violent. My appetite is gone which is a wonderful thing. The weightloss is almost worth being sick. I will continue with the 5 pen_ but in a month my doctor wants me to go back to the 10. I'm not crazy about the idea_ but I will give it a try. My BG is pretty good right now and have lost 5 pounds in 7 days. I have to force myself to drink water because I'm never thirsty. Not good.

I was also on Lantus insulin AM/PM and Novolog with meals along with the Byetta and 1500 mg of metformin in PM.  No benefits from Byetta for me; I am VERY disappointed.

Later that night I had diarrhea. I have lost about 20 lbs (FROM 160 TO 139) since I started without any real effort on my part ( I hate to excersise and only do it sporadically). Byetta has reduced my crazy hunger attacks and now I can wait for regular meal times.

I have went from 275 pounds to 195 and I am still losing slowly.  have totally changed my eating habits because I just don't feel hungry.

It controls my appetite.  The pills_ metphormin_ and glimpride have made me gain weight and be bloated.

151, 5, Type Two Diabetes,The only side effect that I experience is the nausea.  I have learned to take the Byetta shot_ eat_ and then take my other meds.  It just seemed to cut down on the nausea so much when I seperated the shot and the pills with my meal.,It has helped me to better control my A1C.  It is 5.7 with the Byetta 10 twice a day and 2 metformin 1000 XR per day.  As my weight went down the metformin was reduced to 500 twice a day. I have went from 236 lbs to 196 lbs (40 pounds lost) at this point.  I had trouble getting my insurance company to ok this for me and was off of it for 4 months...just on metformin...and I was hungry all the time and gained some weight back along with my A1C being 7.4!  Now I am back  on Byetta/metformin and I have energy and feel so much better.  I am a little concerned about the pancreatitis possibility.  Would like more info on that.  I had a grandmother_ father_ and brother all with diabetes.  Thanks to Byetta for giving diabetics a new lease on life.  Had my eye exam this week and eyes were very healthy_ BP is under control.

152, 4, pre-diabetic and weight loss,I guess I've been one of the lucky ones.  I've had almost all of the symptoms mentioned but none were severe.  I started with the nausea which I still have but not as bad or as often and the stomach cramps and upset bowels at least once or twice a week.  I've also had the rapid heart rate although not much.  I have times when I burp alot and usually foul smelling.  On the other hand_ I've lost 64 lbs. and don't crave food like I used to.  I don't have that nervous_ got-to-eat-something feeling anymore.  My portions are smaller because I know when I've had enough.  If I eat more than that_ I feel awful.  I lost quickly at first but have slowed down now. My doctor has encouraged exercise which would speed the weight loss up but I haven't done much of it.  My blood sugar stays pretty much around 100 unless I eat the wrong foods.,I take Byetta along with Glucophage.  Together they have worked wonders for me.  I have been extremely overweight since I was pregnant 15 years ago.  I knew immediately after giving birth that something had changed in my body.  I had always been overweight but never as severely as I am now.  Dieting was always difficult but I could do it.  After pregnancy_ it was impossible no matter what I tried.

I can't chew sugarless gum anymore either.  Greatly decreased appetite.  All my life I woke up feeling starved but now I don't even feel hungry when I wake up.  ,About once a week I skip an evening dose_ and really don't see much change in my sugar levels with just that one missed dose.  Recently I forgot my Byetta at the cabin and was without it for a week_ and had to really work like crazy on diet and exercise to keep my sugars from going nuts_ so do appreciate the Byetta after having gone through that.,F,55,4  months,8/13/2008,Byetta

161, 2, Diabetes Type 2,"Vomiting.  Constant_ almost debilitating_ nausea even when it did not lead to actual vomiting.  I had to be meticulous with my food intake.  Take the Byetta shot_ immediately eat a tiny amount_ not to exceed 2 tablespoons.  One hour later eat a small meal. I spent all my time planning around eating.Once I did start vomiting_ it continued intermittently for 30 to   60 minutes often followed by chills and lack of energy which sent me to bed for a nap.Weight loss.  I loved the weight loss and wish I had been able to continue with the Byetta.  It was a wonderful appetite suppressant as well as making food taste a bit ""off"" so that I could not turn to food for comfort.  Wish I could have continued taking it but I just could not handle feeling sick 20 hours a day.",The subQ shots were painless.  The weightloss led to improved blood pressure levels.  I would go back to this med in a minute if they could improve it/lessen the nausea effect.,F,60,9  months,7/10/2008,Byetta

So far_ that's been the remedy_ but_ my goodness_ it was HORRIBLE!!,I've only been on Byetta for only a few weeks_ so I havent experienced the weight loss (though I'm really looking forward to it LOL).

174, 3, Type II diabetes; weight loss,I experience nausea on a pretty regular basis.  I have tried waiting an hour to eat_ and eating within 10-15 minutes_ and have the same nausea no matter the time waiting.  I HAVE lost about 15 pounds since beginning Byetta.  Lately_ the nausea has led to vomiting 1-2 times a week when it is severe.  I have noticed extreme chills after taking my Byetta too_ especially with the evening meal.  I usually have to take a hot bath in order to get warmed up.  Now that I think about it_ it is usually these severe chilled episodes that lead to the extreme nausea and vomiting.  Has anyone else experienced this side effect?  I am also taking Metformin 1000 mg twice a day.,All in all_ I am pleased with the results of weight loss and lower sugars.  I have noticed blood sugars are at their lowest (90 or so range) about an hour after taking the Byetta.

I still have to exercise and watch what I eat_ but my A1C readings have dropped about 4 points on average. The last reading went up about .7_ but it is related to job loss stress I believe.

194, 5, Type II Diabetes,Weight loss big time! Slight nausea at first_ but it leveled off_ then went away completely. I do not get hungry as before. I do notice a slight low-sugar headache in the evenings (maybe once a week)_ but that's solved by a sip of juice.,"Been on it 2 years now and love it. Weight is staying off. If you feel any nausea_ then eat right away instead of waiting. Also_ if I take my shot and then I don't eat within an hour_ I get to feeling slightly nauseated_ so don't wait too long after the shot. This allowed me to get off Actos which made me gain huge amounts of weight and the swelling was horrible. My doctor knew Actos was ""hurting me"" but he said that was the only thing that would help at the time. When Byetta came out he immediately took me off the Actos. What a relief! Swelling went down_ lost weight_ and BS rates are normalized. Lower A1C too - 5.9 last test.",F,59,2  years,6/4/2007,Byetta

196, 5, Type 2 Diabetes,I have been on Byetta now for 8 months now. For me it has worked great. I have lost about 30 pounds and am near my target for blood sugar and wieght. My readings are between 90 and 140 with an average of 119_ depending on what I eat and how much exercise I get. I did experience some nausea and rapid heart beat as described by others but it was minor. I do not experience the extreem sugar highs and lows that I did with Glucotrol. Avandia did not work_ and I take Metformin as well. Once you are used to it and to giving yourself an injection you should do fine. I never believed I could give myself an injection but this is so painless and easy. I did experience a little bit of bruising from the injections and discovered that I was pinching myself too tight during the injection. Hope this helps.,You do not have to keep Byetta refrigerated any more_ you just have to keep it cool. I do keep it in the refrigerator when I can but I travel a lot so it is a good thing that they found a way around that.,M,57,8  months,5/28/2007,Byetta
