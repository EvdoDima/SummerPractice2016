The second month_ no spotting but I cannot handle the bathroom issues and stomach pains that have become almost debilitating.

23, 1, To stop constant bleeding,Nausea_ heavy bleeding_ cramping,I was put on birth control pills to stop the constant (light to moderate) bleeding I'd been having for two years_ but since I have no insurance_ I had to go with a generic brand instead of my usual Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo (which actually worked). First week of pills_ I was just a little nauseous_ but didn't bleed. The second and third weeks_ I started bleeding again like I had been before taking the pills_ and the fourth week when I was supposed to get a period_ I started bleeding very heavily for days and days_ soaking through super-absorbency tampons about every 2 hours and bleeding all down my legs and onto the floor after standing up. I also developed cramps so bad that I couldn't sleep. I never had symptoms this bad even when I was still having a naturally-occurring period. I am not going back on these pills when they not only didn't cure the original problem_ but made it worse.,F,28,1  monthsN/A 1X D,11/25/2015Email,Sprintec

26, 2, Birth Control to not get pregnant,I started taking this pill to not get pregnant. I started on a Thursday 3 weeks before my period and it seemed great. Then came time for my period to start and it did like 3 days later which I assumed was because I was taking active pills. Well it has been 15 days and I still have normal bleeding and no signs that my period is going to stop. I started my active pills already and went into week two of the second pack of active pills and like I said no signs of stopping. I decided yesterday to stop taking the pills hoping that it will help. I did not see these reviews before starting this pill and I'm only on this one because it was covered by my insurance but it just doesn't seem worth it.

35, 1, Irregular periods,This pill is total shit....it was prescribe to me to regulate my periods and while it did do that_ the side effects were horrendous.

I barely left my house and was afraid to drive for the remainder of the week.I had subsequent panic attacks and severe anxiety for the rest of that week along with chest pains and heart palpitations. At one point my anxiety levels were so high I thought I would vomit. I was so scared that I would drop dead any minute from a heart attack. This drug made me a severely anxious emotional irrational mess of a human being. and many of the side effects have lingered for the past five months....I am now seeing an anxiety counselor and at one point spent 24 hours hooked up to a heart monitor because I've been having heart palpitations ever since that wk back in March.

Both lasted 7 days each_ and both were heavy. I called my doctor and I was told it takes 3 months for your body to get use to it. My breath were very tender in the second month (which I was told was normal also). The third month I felt a little better and my period was shorter and lighter. I am tired all of the time. I can sleep for 8 hours a night_ take a 2 hour nap during the day_ and fall asleep by 9:30 at night. I have been extremely moody over EVERYTHING!! AND I never got cramps until this one.

When that happened I'd usually get ovarian cysts and have to go to the hospital once they ruptured. That or wicked cramps. Other than that it's a great pill.

At first it was ok_ little bit of breakthrough bleeding_ cramps etc but totally normal. Then I started getting moody and I thought oh maybe it's just stress. This past weekend confirmed that it was the pill. I got irritable mean and depressed over nothing and nearly snapped at my boyfriend numerous times which obviously pissed him off. Constantly have had the feeling of wanting to cry the past few days as well and have felt ridiculous anxiety. Needless to say I have already had my doctor call in a new script for a pill that has had zero complaints in their office (multiple gynos there) about mood swings and irritability and depression_ so hopefully this will be the winner.,,F,24,2  months,2/2/2015,Sprintec

Having periods not regulate is the issue for me I'll have mine for about a month then I'll only not have it for no more than a week and I'll have my period all over again. I don't know if I'm the only one with that problem but I'm looking into getting something different because I can't catch a break. I'm horrible about taking pills on time but you have to with birth control so if you miss a day you just double the next day.,,F,23,9  months1X D,1/8/2015Email,Sprintec
65, 2, Birth Control,I was giving this pill because it was a low Dose. The first month i started getting really bad cystic acne around my jaw line and chin. Pro active works thank god. My Period came 2 days early_ no problems with that. The 2nd month came around and I became a whole different person. Horrible mood swings_ my bf doesnt know how to deal with me anymore. Every thing sets me off now. I'm super violent also. Takes me forever to fall asleep_ I'm super Anxious  and my heart feels like its gonna come out of my chest. Alot of muscle pains.

67, 2, For Birth Control Purposes,Acne_ dryness in vaginal area_ spotting throughout time between periods_ occasional yeast infections.,My gyno switched me to Sprintec for cost/convenience purposes. I had been taking it for the past 3 or 4 years and had these odd symptoms I hadn't really experienced in the past; such as acne_ dryness_ and infections. I put the pieces together and realized Sprintec was the cause as I am incredibly healthy_ clean_ and not acne prone. I spoke about it with my gyno_ and she verified that these are all common side effects.,F,25,3  years30 mg,12/2/2014,Sprintec

I have no appetite_ I usually get sick and pass out_ because I only eat when I'm hungry_ but when I eat it makes me even sicker_ vomiting and all. I've been getting really sudden headaches_ even if I've been sitting in silence_ or been asleep. My depression has gotten worse_ but I haven't been holding onto water weight like my doctor warned me might happen.

73, 3, Regulation of period,Was put on Sprintec to regulate my cycles and it did work for that_ but the side effects weren't worth it to me.  I ended up going off the medication about a week ago and am already seeing an improvement in all effected areas.   While on this medication i experienced violent mood swings_ constipation_ insomnia_  terrifyingly vivid nightmares_ weight gain_ drastically increased appitite_  bloating_ cystic acne_ fatigue_ and very heavy periods.  They were so heavy in fact that they only lasted about 2 to 3 days.  I didn't dare leave the house for fear of an accident and they left me completely sapped of any energy whatsoever.  I wouldn't NOT recommend this medication to anyone just because everyone is differnet and what works for some may not work for others.  Some people experience no side effects at all.

My breast are also very tender. I am going to finish my last pack and get switched to something else. The feeling in my stomach is unbearable and very uncomfortable.

My OB gave me this pill to regulate my 7-day period (i've been bleeding for 4 days now) and to stop some cramping in which I thought was associated with endometriosus. So far_ its ok. Eating is normal_ sex drive is normal_ no break outs or pimples_ no headaches or mood swings - thank you Jesus! But I've only been on it for a short while.

85, 1, Shorten periods/Prevent Pregnancy,The beginning of it up to 10 months of the pill I felt okay. I don't want to say I felt perfect because then I'd be lying. I had slight mood swings but I thought that was just normal_ I was fatigued but I thought that was just normal_ my breasts were extremely tender; if you tried to poke it I would cry. I got hot flashes but it was like every other month. When 11 months hit it started to get worse_ I was having really bad nightmares_ night sweats_ I would cry at the drop of the hat_ I was completely sensitive physically emotionally. My life became a emotional roller coaster. I did not know what to do; I had people tell me to stop taking it because they had the same side effects but I didn't listen. I've been on it for 1 year and 8 months. It is worst thing ever. I am very mean_ always crying_ hot flashes galore (3 to 5 in a row; once a week)_ tender breast_ throwing up_ wacky appetites (one day I'm hungry the next I'm not)_ fatigued 100%_ FEEL LIKE I LOST CONTROL OF MYSELF!

It has made me eat more which I don't like because I'm self conscious about my weight. My only complaints are the cramps and mood swings! It has increased my sex drive a lot.

ZERO sex drive....my husband thinks I hate him.  Very moody at times.  I feel weak and tired as well.  I switched to this pill because it was cheap ($9 USD). I guess I will be switching back.

Would not recommend sprintec to anyone.,,F,24,4  months,3/7/2014Email,Sprintec
108, 2, Birth control,I got on this three years ago right before my wedding. I had never been on any birth control. I had shorter periods_ less cramping and the timing was always perfect.  I just got off it and my husband asked me why I was so happy these days. I realized that it completely changed my mood. I was snappy and easily irritated.  I was always near my period. It was like terrible PMS. I never had this before the pill. I knew it messed with my levels . I really don't think I'm ever going back on the pill. It's not worth it at all!! I wish I would have realized it sooner . I just didn't realize it was as bad as it was until I got off of it. Also I had the awful headaches that I even talked to my eye doctor about .

111, 3, birth control_ acne,I switched to sprintec after hearing about increased blood clot risk with Yasmin. I tried ortho-tri-cyclin and it made me crazy hormonal. On sprintec I have less acne but I still have flare ups more around my period. My sex drive is almost nothing_ to the point I find it disgusting and it is hurting my relationship. I have a history of depression and got seriously depressed and suicidal with anxiety attacks last year_ which I have been able to overcome for the most part by changing my thinking patterns and recognizing when I am about to go down thatsspiral so I can try and prevent it. I have always had light periods_ and on this pill I have cramps for about 30 mins every 3-4 months. My period lasts for 4 days. I don't take the white pills since they are just filler pills and I use a phone alarm to remember to take it. I like that the combination pill has a longer period during which you're still good if you take it late in the day. I have been researching other bc methods such as mirena_ paragard_ skyla_ and Nexplanon and have decided they seem worse with side effects than this pill.

I feel like I take 2 benadryl at night.  It was nice at first bc it helped me sleep_  but its torture to wake up in the morning_  and I am groggy all day like I had taken a sleeping pill.

Now that I've had sex_ I am not pregnant_ so it definitely works on that part_ which is the most important part_ and I had the same experience with the previous pills_ and I put up with the effects because longterm it's doing the job it's suppose to do! I'm hoping it's the same experience with my previous one and these effects will go away in about a year_ if not I'll definitely look into a different brand.

I want to stop taking this pill but at the same time I am wondering if all this will go away the longer I take it,,F,27,8  days 1X D,4/21/2013Email,Sprintec

131, 1, birth control,Moody/irritable/angry outbursts. I was just switched to this pill because ortho tri cyclen had begun causing mood swings. (Was on ortho tri cyclen for several years without side effects. Mood swings started when I was 29). This pill made me feel sad and angry by the third day and kept getting worse. I would have taken time to see if it got better but I kept yelling at my 3 year old and knew  it was hormonal. Not putting him through that.,,F,30,8  days,3/3/2013,Sprintec

133, 3, birth control,weight gain large appitite and skin irritations that turned into rashes,The only problem i had was the weight gain and skin irritations... When i started taking it i weighed 130. Now i weigh 150... i was suddenly hungry all the time and when it came the time of the month for my normal cycle. i would become very itchy over my entire body.. However the skin rashes didnt start until i decided to stop using the pill...When i stop using the pill my cycle didnt come on for 6 months... i would have severe skin irritations and rashes instead. it has been a year since i stopped taking this birth control n my cycle is still irregular... No more skin irritations at this point though,F,21,3  months 1X D,12/15/2012Email,Sprintec
134, 5, heavy/irregular cycle&birth control,Anxiety during menstrual cycle when combined with caffeine,I have been taking this for about 7 months now and I have not had any major problems. I found if I have caffeine during my cycle (white pills) I am prone to anxiety attacks_ but cutting out caffeine starting 24 hours before (when I take the last blue pill) has stopped these anxiety attacks from happening all together. I am able to have my morning coffee the rest of the time with no side effects_ and can start having caffeine again once my cycle finishes_ regardless of what day of my medication I am on (white -vs- blue pills). Otherwise I have not experienced any negative side effects. My PMS symptoms are almost non-existent after the 3rd month_ and my heavy and irregular cycles became regular and manageable by the 2nd month. As far a effectiveness: I'm active (monogamously_ with tolerable regularity) and happy to say NOT a mommy or mommy to be! Overall: Great experience so far_ highly effective for my needs. No negative side effects.,F,23,7  months1 tab 1X D,12/7/2012Email,Sprintec

138, 3, Prevent pregnancy,Weight gain,This pill has worked pretty well for me except for the rapid weight gain. I've gained about 10 lbs with in the first 2 months of using it even though I have been dieting and exercising_ had to buy clothes next size up which is depressing when I've been the same size for quite some time. Looking to go back to ortho cyclen which worked well for me before the pharmacy switched me to generic.,F,25,6  months 1X D,7/15/2012Email,Sprintec
139, 1, prevent pregnancy,I experienced horrible mood swings_ felt depressed and found myself crying constantly for no reason. I was constantly snapping at my kids over little things. I only took it for 3 months then stopped. Since I've stopped taking it I have had 3 periods that last about 5 days each and were about 5 days apart. Now I have constant cramps all the time and my hips and lower back are always aching_ not to mention the constant bloating feeling.  This was my first time to ever to use birth control and will never use it again I just want my body back!,,F,28,1  days30,6/18/2012Email,Sprintec
140, 1, prevent pregnancy,I was taking ortho tri cyclin but I tried this 1 instead because it was less expensive. both were very horrible.  I was tired all the time and I had horrible mood swings horrible ones. I was constantly fighting with everyone_ everyone annoyed me_ I was fighting with them for no reason. I would be outraged at the smallest things. I remember crying all the time and my boyfriend would always ask me whats  wrong and I would tell 'em I didn't know. my family started to think I was highly depressed and I need to go see someone or get on medication. I knew it wasn't me and I knew it was the pills so I stopped taking them and I changed 100 percent. I would never ever ever get on these pills no matter what! any pills that gradually give you more and more estrogen each day does not work with me.,,F,31,6  years,6/5/2012,Sprintec
141, 2, ,Migraines_ breakthrough bleeding_ spotting_ large blood clots during menstrual cycle_ nipple discharge_ shooting pains in breasts_ bloating_ fatigue,I had my gyno switch me from Cryselle to Sprintec primarily because I think Cryselle made me cranky and easily irritated. After being on Sprintec (generic Mononessa) for 31⁄2 months_ I have experienced awful and frequent migraines_ uncomfortable bloating_ fatigue_ shooting pains in my breasts_ nipple discharge_ and worst-of-all_ I've been spotting/breakthrough bleeding every single day for the last 2 months. I haven't been able to have intercourse since switching to Sprintec. For the first month_ my face broke out in whiteheads all over. I also found blood clots the size of whole-shelled peanuts in my pad during my period. Needless to say_ it was scary. The only thing positive I can say about Sprintec is that it DID help improve my mood slightly. I've asked my gyno to switch back to Cryselle or Nuvaring.,F,26,120  days 1X D,6/1/2012Email,Sprintec
142, 2, birth control,terrible itchy skin_ developed into a rash and then blister type itchy sores,I switched to Sprintec from Apri because I needed more estrogen. I feel terrific on Sprintec! My energy is up_ I dont constantly feel hungry my appetite is normal_ I am sleeping well_ I dont have to force myself to do things (on Apri I had to force myself to everything including getting out of bed!) However I just cant take the itching. I tried to stick it out because I feel sooooo much better but the skin issue is just too much.,F,43,30  days 1X D,4/17/2012,Sprintec

145, 5, birth control_ endometriosis,Nausea_ slightly more depressed moods,"I was switched to this from Apri because I needed a higher estrogen dose. So far it's been fine_ except that for the first few pills fo each pack I get really bad nausea (it's getting better each month_ though.) I have less acne and my periods are less painful. My moods are more ""down"" when I'm on birth control_ but that always happens to me regardless of which formulation. On Apri I had really bad breast tenderness and swelling but get neither on this pill (very strange for me!)_ and I wouldn't actually count that as a positive since I rather appreciated the swelling. Overall this pill has been good for me. My apetite and weight have remained static aside from a couple pounds of water weight occasionally. If you have weight gain it's not ""because of the pill_"" it's because you're eating too much! You have to be smarter than your apetite_ ladies.",F,22,4  months1 1X D,12/11/2011,Sprintec
146, 2, Birth Control,Weight gain_ bloating_ constipation_ breast enlargement. Also some acne in the beginning.,I began taking this medication on the recommendation of my doctor. It was priced very manageably_ but you get exactly what you pay for. It made me gain A LOT of weight.,F,19,2  months.25/.035 1X D,9/19/2011Email,Sprintec
147, 1, severe cramps,Constant hunger_ food cravings_ and HUGE weight gain.  Moody_ irritable_ depressed.  Very painful breasts.  Bloating.  Nausea and heartburn.,Thank God I found this site!   I have been eating every thing in sight_ although after taking the pill in the evening_ I felt like I had swallowed burning tar.  Dr. said it would help with cramps--cramps are slightly less_ but the pain in my back from having a bloated stomach makes up for any cramp relief.  Nothing fits...in the middle of a hot summer I am squeezed into my clothes--I literally have only four items that still fit and NO money to buy larger clothes.  Have gone from 111 to 125. Am miserable!,F,46,3  months 1X D,8/17/2011Email,Sprintec
148, 3, Contraceptive,Irregular periods,I have 2 periods a month on this dumb pill and get cramping and spotting every single month. I was more regular when I wasn't on the pill. I'm taking it because I don't want to get pregnant. My plan is to switch pills because I hate getting 2 periods a month and after all this time (2 years)_ my periods have not adjusted to the hormone level. As far as I know_ I'm not getting other side effects from this pill though.,F,28,2  years 1X D,11/30/2010,Sprintec
149, 5, contraceptive,I started to get acid reflux within a few days_ but other than that this has been perfect.  I used to take another kind that I experienced severe symptoms with where I was sick and sore every single day. So far this has been great and the switch has made a world of a difference.,Short and light periods a huge plus.,F,29,2  months 1X D,11/22/2010,Sprintec
150, 4, birth control_ perimenopause,If I miss a pill_ I start spotting almost immediately and of course I get back on schedule the next day_ but I will spot until the end of the cycle.  Also I have much more of a withdrawal period than I did on lower dose birth control pills.  If you take this_ don't forget a dose!!!!,It's cheap and it seems to work well for me for birth control and to control my perimenopause symptoms.  But during my withdrawal period week_ I will have night sweats and a lot of bleeding_ which sucks.,F,37,1  years 1X D,11/4/2010,Sprintec
151, 5, Painful menstal cycle_ Bad PMS_,I have had no side effects.,I have not taken any birth control for at least 8 years.  I previously took birth control to help me have regular periods and less pain.  I am not sure why I stopped taking birth control.  Recently_ I decided to ask for birth control again.  The pain has been bad_ the pms has been very bad.  I was really really tired of suffering.  I was afraid to take the birth control because I try to avoid prescription medication as much as possible.  It took me 3 months after being prescribed to take the medicine.  I never had problems in the past_ but I know my body has probably changed over the years.  I have been on the pill for 35 days and I have had no side effects at all.  My pms_ and cramping and pain are barely there.  I had just one period so far_ so I hope this month I have even less pain.  I am very happy with sprintec and recommend it to anyone.  Anyone over 35 should be a non-smoker if they want birth control.,F,38,35  days.250/.035 1X D,9/12/2010Email,Sprintec
152, 2, menstrual fluctuations,increasing nausea_ grouchiness_ foot/knee pain_ burning tongue,I've always had problems taking birth control pills so I was expecting some nausea when I started taking this one_ but thought the nausea would be better than the horrible periods I was experiencing. I was totally unprepared for how bad it was. And it continuously got worse. At first it was only for about an hour after taking the pill_ then it became an all day thing. Later on I started noticing that my tongue would swell and burn HORRIBLY. Didn't think it was related for the longest time. Then I started noticing problems with my feet hurting or knees sore even though I hadn't done anything to cause this. Again_ didn't think it was related. Started doing research on the tongue issue (because it became so bad that un-ketchuped fries burned like crazy) and found that tongue burning was a big side effect of a Folic acid and/or B-12 deficiency--which I later found was also a big side effect of taking birth control pills in a lot of people. One thing caused another and so forth. I started taking a multi-vitamin every day (after about 3 months on the pill) and my tongue is MUCH better_ plus I don't suffer from the joint/knee pain any more or the nausea that I usually experience with the pill. The pill was horrible_ but manageable with the right supplements.,F,35,3  months 1X D,4/27/2010Email,Sprintec
