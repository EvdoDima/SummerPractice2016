0, 1, glaucoma,such severe stinging & burning_ it nearly put me off eye drops for good,dr switched me to another similar drop called azarga. much much more comfortable.,M,58,4  weeks,2/1/2010,Cosopt
1, 5, Open-angle glaucoma,Slight stinging/irritabilty in eyes shortly after administering.,I was taking Timoptic 1x/day and was switched to Cosopt 2x/day to try to get eye pressures lower than with the Timoptic.  I am doing MUCH better on the Cosopt than I was on the Timoptic_ as the beta-blocker ingredient seems to be less potent.  I am a runner_ and switching to Cosopt has helped me to be able to run faster and more effortlessly than when I was on the Timoptic. And so far my pressures are closer to where my eye doctor wants them to be.,F,47,9  months,3/24/2008,Cosopt
2, 1, open angle glaucoma,Stinging upon administration of drops_ red_ itchy eyes_ slight headache_ allergic eyes,I took timoptic_ one of the ingredients in cosopt_ for 20 years without problems.  But my pressure was creeping up around 25-27_ so dr. tried adding the eye diuretic.  It was uncomfortable for me and didn't lower the pressure at all.  I do have sensitive eyes_ though_ apparently.  Timoptic alone (or generic timolol) never bothered me.,F,58,1  months,11/17/2007,Cosopt
3, 2, glaucoma,faint-feeling_chest pain_palpitations_dyspnea etc(mostly cardiac/respiratory symptoms),not a good experience with this drug..prescribed two times a day but only tolerable once a day and I skip a day if symptomatic. ...awful but doc would not change it. i wondered if preservatives were at fault but doc shot that down.,F,60,2  years,9/15/2007,Cosopt
4, 1, glaucoma,I developed corneal decompensation.  I was unable to read_ watch TV_ drive or do any of the things I usually do. This lasted for several months.,,F,75,4  weeks,2/18/2007Email,Cosopt
