1, 1, Anxiety,Clonazepam ruined my mother's life and absolutely cause dementia and Alzheimer's she is off it in as a new person but the damage it has done I could kill her doctor for what she has done telling me that 10 a day was just fine if that's what she needs to go to sleep I knew she was taking too many I asked about it all the time finally psychotic was led to the hospital where is psychiatrist said your mother has dementia caused by clonazepam.

2, 1, Chronic anxiety disorder,Yes_ this medication works. It works very well for chronic anxiety disorder and  sudden onsets of severe panic attacks. Knowing what I know now_ I wish with all my being it had never ever been prescribed to me_ and without the absurd nonchalance dozens of practitioners have portrayed. I'm 32 and have been prescribed clonazopam for 14 years. Ive been in situations where my health insurance is in transition and I must go off the medication abruptly-- this is when I realized how deep I was. Weeks upon weeks of non stop physical_ emotional_ and psychological withdrawal effects that are like hell. Words cannot accurately describe just how awful it is.,This_ again_ has been my experience during withdrawal as a long term clonazopam patient. All skin_ especially the face_ becomes numb. Vision gets fuzzy and difficult to see clearly. Panic attacks become extremely exasperated_ frequent and debilitating. Severe irritability. Worst of all: a terrifying disconnection between your mind and body; as if you're an onlooker watching and feeling this horrible thing happen to you_ but not actually feeling connected to any of it-- that one is tough to explain. All of this... It can lasts months_ maybe more. That's right. Not just some one week hump to overcome. After finding how awful the withdrawal is I've been attempting to ween very very slowly down from 3 2mg doses per day to eventually zero_ hopefully. After six months of gradually decreases in dose I'm now at 2- 1mg doses per day and I'm not sure how or if I can go much less than that. No doctors I've had have been of any help. The ween down was my idea and the rate of it was also my idea based on experience. It sure would be nice to meet a doctor that truly had knowledge of this withdrawal syndrome and took it a bit more seriously. I am confident that the medication is no longer treating my anxiety disorder_ but simply preventing withdrawal from the meds themselves. And there don't seem to be any good alternatives. It's a long road ahead_ please think it over and over with someone knowledgeable before being so quick to embrace this miracle drug. The truth is that most of us ac,F,32,10  years6 mg/ day,6/10/2016Email,Clonazepam

I keep thinking my mom is in the other room but she has been gone almost 20 years. Woke up this morning wasn't sure where I was. I'm really scared of this med now but dr said to stay on it. Never understood when people said they felt like zombies but that is what I feel. I also have the feeling I can take more_ didn't have that when I took xanax.

6, 5, Depression and Anxiety,None,I am so thankful that I listened to my MD to take this in tandem with Mirtazapine (Rememron).  I have had ZERO side effects and I'm not burning in benzo hell as some would have you believe.  It relaxes me for sleeping and works very well for deep anxiety.  Make sure you give it time.

7, 5, anxiety,for a benzo it has very little to no side effects. was used to remove me from Xanax. I noticed no transition switching cold turkey and actually felt better.,Klonopin is a great benzo having taken several that had terrible side effects. it is a very mild drug and really works so well you don't notice it.

8, 4, Neck Tremor,Mostly off-balance feeling when I first started along with joint aches.,After months of taking it I don't have any side effects_ It does reduce my neck tremor so I'm happy with the medication. It doesn't work 100 percent but its close. If I don't take the medication for a few days to take a break from it I will then feel  dizzy or like I'm off balance when walking along with a heavy spacy head.

10, 3, Anxiety and unable to sleep,Tired_ no energy_ headache and itching and headache at higher dose_ skin stings as in hurts like aches and pains in the body sometimes_ and horrible cold and hot sweats also hard to eat at times like a full feeling_ UTI that I have never had and lots of ear infections and memory issues most of the side effects started the longer I was on it. It also no longer helps me sleep unless I go way up and sorry i'm just not doing that. If you don't have to take these drugs for something very serious then I would subject not talking them at all as it can and it will eventually ruin you life.,At first this worked great and I was very relaxed_ and was able to sleep like a baby however_ I slowly started to feel like I didn't want to do anything but stay home and started to neglect the things I needed to accomplish during the day. I wish I never started it as this drug creeps up on your system very slow and before you realize it if you do at all that is as it kind of gives you a I don't give a care feeling. I took myself down off of it slowly as I was put on it 3 times a day at .05 and then I went down on it to 10 with in 6 months as I stated to see thanks to my kids that I had no energy at all and no desire to do anything. so stayed on this for a long time then in the last year have gone up and down on it for 10 to .05 and now staying at .05 and doing my best to get off of it!!

I am very worried about addiction_ but to be honest_ living your life in constant panic attacks_to the point you have no quality of life- well it's a risk i am willing to take.

23, 4, anxiety,At first_ I did not experience any side effects that I knew of. I had not read about the side effects. I have inherited arthritis and I've had two back surgeries on my lower back. My knees often hurt and occasionally my ankles but I credited all off that to getting older. Boy_ was I wrong. I just had a good friend die recently_ I am in the process of selling things and getting ready to move_ and I'm doing a lot of work which hurts my back_ plus I have allergies.I was taking a couple more pills than I should have because of the stress_but when I was taking it before it seemed pretty mild. It is not! It took me about 3 days to figure out why I was walking like a 95 year old woman_ My ankles hurt severely_ and my entire body had aches and pains. Then I looked up the side effects for the very first time. I could not believe it. I suffered from every single side effect. I cut down my dose immediately_ and already the next day half of the pain was gone.I am almost hopeful that my back is going to start feeling better_ because after two surgeries it still gave me problems. Side effects include muscle aches and joint pain. As soon as I taper off_ I will never take this again.,,F,58,1  years.05 x 3,5/6/2015,Clonazepam

31, 2, Anxiety,I have been having panic attacks_ social anxiety_ and hypochondria for several years. Was on Lexapro and Alprazolam for breakthrough anxiety. I gained 30 lbs on the Lexapro although it worked well so I decided to come off of it and I've already lost 7lbs in about 2 weeks. Anyway_ Dr prescribed Clonozepam since it supposedly lasts longer than Alprazolam. I took it and felt nothing unusual but it did not even touch my anxiety. After two hours_ I started flushing_ sweating_ and throwing up. I could not sleep that night and when I finally did fall asleep around 7:30am_ I had hellish nightmares and kept waking up. The entire next day I felt like I had a bad hangover and a headache that wouldn't quit. I do not recommend this medicine.

I did have occasional panic and insomnia.  After many years_ I began having problems passing urine.  With a quick search_ Clonazepam came up.  I am using catheters_ getting infection after infection_ and am trying to get off the drug.  I have researched the Ashton Manuel_ and am trying the Valium crossover.  It's been a nightmare_ and I haven't even completed the crossover!  Please_ stay away from Benzodiazepines!  I'm a medical professional_ and didn't do my homework.

35, 1, anxiety,was on 4mg per day which didn't help me that much but affected my cognitive abilities which i wasn't aware of until told by others_ slurred speech_ seemed drunk_ driving badly_ not able to function well ie looking after myself_ cleaning up etc. Like a zombie.,Tapering off 10% per week as per doctors instructions and Ashton Manual(online)  Went from 4mg to 1mg with very stong but bearable alternating withdrawal symptoms including_ being totally wiped out-sleeping 16hrs_ slight panic attacks/adrenalin rushes_ very high anxiety_ dilated pupils_ itchy skin_ sweating_ unable to remember dates/mixing up appointments etc. Very wound up and uncomfortable but with times of feeling ok so i was able to reduce the dosage. I got to around 1mg then i got hit with symptoms so unbearable that i have stopped at this dose_ i felt like i had decended into hell; depression_ burning skin(when starting to sweat)_ feelings of terror_ feelings of helplessness_ not wanting to get out of bed_ difficulty doing every day tasks_ suicidal idealation (would rather be dead at times).  Knowing it is only going to get worse for months makes it all worse.  Feeling trapped.  I would not have taken this medicine if i knew that the withdrawal symptoms would be worse than the anxiety it was supposed to control.  Everyone is different some people have no withdrawal symptoms and use it for years but this how it has affected me.  Will be seeing doctor on weekly basis and try to work something out.,M,36,1.5  years1mg 1X D,5/19/2014Email,Clonazepam
36, 5, Anxiety_ PTSD_ Insomnia,I've not experienced any negative side effects while taking the drug it is difficult to stop taking,Clonazepam has essentially cured my insomnia (along with trazodone)and has made dealing with PTSD and anxiety a lot easier.  I took .5 mg 1x a day for about 2 yrs (took 1 extra per day during extreme times)then about a year ago I lowered the dose to .25 mg 1x per day with no problem.  My new doctor wants to get me off the clonazepam and she suggested I take the pill only every other day but so far that has not been doable for me_ I don't sleep w/o it and the next day I can't really function. The clonazepam also helps with pain associated with a herniated disc in my neck and loss of disc in spine_ I do not take any other drugs for pain nor anything else.,F,57,3  years.25 mg 1X D,3/26/2014,Clonazepam

38, 2, Myoclonic Jerks,Drowziness_ depression_ trouble with sleeping_ problems with co-ordination_ memory loss_ 'brain fog'_ confusion_ poor attention_ DEPENDENCE,I have Clonazepam at such as high dose because I have a rare Neurological Movement disorder called 'Myoclonic-Dystonia'. Sure_ Clonazepam alleviates the twitching and muscle spasms... until I get more tolerance and have to take more. Started taking Clonazepam about a year and a half ago- initially I  started on 2 mg a day :/ If anybody is offered this drug should really question it_ especially it is being indicated for long-term use. I didn't question enough and now I have such a strong dependence and ever increasing tolerance_ there are plans to up me to the max dose (20 mg). This drug has made me an addict_ I sometimes try to try to take less but the withdrawal is HELL.

39, 4, Panic/anxiety/depression/bipolar 2,None really,Clonazepam works for my panic attacks/anxiety and helps me to sleep. If I lose sleep I become hypomanic. I have had GAD since I was a child and am now 71 years old. I stopped drinking alcohol 24 years ago_ since it was not a medication_ and it only made my mental disorder worse.  I can't take any antidepressants beyond beginning doses because they induce hypomania.So I take the clonazepam  when I have episodes that bring me extreme panic or anxiety_ or when my insomnia gets worse.Typically I take between three quarters and one and a half milligrams at night only for sleep.When my panic or anxiety kicks up because of situational things_ I am increased to a total of 2 1/2 mg per day.  At present I am on that protocol. It has been the first time in almost 5 years that I have needed to take regular clonazepam  during the day to break up the anxiety_ panic part of my disorder.  While I don't like taking it_ it is the only thing that helps me. If I tried to cut back to soon the episode only gets worse.Normally_ I take only the bedtime dose. From time to time the psychiatrist is in support of my tapering_ which I have to do very slowly. Then I may get down to 1 mg at night for several months.Many people here talk about the severe withdrawal reactions. In my case the doctor and I both agree_ that when I get down too low_ it is not withdrawal_ but my primary bipolar to that kicks in _ which includes panic anxiety insomnia and depression.Right now_ I seem to have episode,F,,16  years1-1&1⁄2 1X D,1/22/2014Email,Clonazepam

42, 1, Dystonic cerebral palsy,insomnia_ depression_ anxiety_ suicidal thoughts,I was first prescribed this when i was about 16_ so then i thought it was a wonder drug because it controlled my tremors and muscle tightness...at least i thought.  What it really did was put me in such a fog that i didn't notice my tremors.  After about a year we raised the dosage from twice_ to three times a day. That's when all hell broke loose with the side effects.  I strongly urge you to try different alternatives and really do some research on this drug before making the decision to take it.,M,18,2  years1 MG 3X D,12/17/2013,Clonazepam
43, 1, For anxiety,rage_ derealization_ depersonalization_ suicidal thoughts and urges_ depression,Within an hour or less of taking this drug I would get extremely depressed and lethargic to the point my husband had to help feed and bathe me. I started having rages FOR NO REASON out of nowhere and then suicidal thoughts and even urges_ again for no reason. This drug as well as others in its class (benzodiazepines) should be limited to short-term (2-4 week) use. Beyond that_ the user could develop a tolerance where more of the drug is needed to reduce anxiety/insomnia. Users also get interdose withdrawal from the drug and feel the need to take more of the drug before the next dose to calm down. Before you know it_ your brain is dependent on it. Withdrawals from this drug are Hellish and last longer (YEARS in some cases) than withdrawal than from street drugs. Cold turkey withdrawal from this drug made all the above side effects much worse and I'm still healing from its effects 18 months later.,F,36,10  weeks0.125 3X D,4/8/2013,Clonazepam

It doesn't last for long though_ it goes away and you begin to just feel calm_ maybe a bit drowsy still.,It definitely helps when I'm feeling the onset of major anxiety or a panic attack and I need help calming myself down. It's not a cure_ I use it along with therapy and tools to help myself relieve my anxiety and panic.

48, 5, Generalized Anxiety Disorder,Sleepy_ clumsy_ slight headaches_ euphoria.,I have never had serious anxiety issues until about seven months ago. For whatever reason my anxiety steadily increased to the point where I had this incredible daily fear that I had something physically wrong and I was dying. I never used to go to the doctor for anything (years i didn't go to the doctor) and suddenly I was calling every week to set up an appointment with an ailment I was sure was life threatening. I convinced my doctor to give me a referral to a cardiologist because of personal fears that something was going on with my heart. I met with an endocronologist over fears that my glands were not functioning correctly and I had an inbalance. I visited the ER thinking I was having a heart attack_ and I had two seperate severe panic attacks. I had numerous blood tests. 2 EKG's_ an echocardiogram_ chest x-rays for lung cancer. I honestly had fears that I had cancer_ an irregular heart beat_ liver failure_ kidney failure_ bone cancer_ deep vein thrombosis_ pancreatitis_ diabetes_ irritable bowel syndrome_ and the list goes on and on. All completely ridiculous_ but my fear was completely real and I couldn't escape it.After finally realizing these daily fears and my constant anxiety wasn't rational or normal I attempted to control it through diet_ excercise and meditation. Months of failed attempts to make anything better I finally set-up another appointment with my doctor to discuss my anxiety issues.

I had no idea how my life was going to change_ for the worst. The detox center had me go cold turkey and so three days later all hell broke loose. When i say all hell_ I literally mean it. The next 2yrs were pure HELL. I was in and out of hopitals the situation got so bad_ I had rather someone take my legs off as long as I was better. I am traumatized from the hell I had to live. Till this day when I talk about I still cry like a baby. So plz if u decide to come off any benzos_ do it in a way that u feel comfortable. First talk to ur Dr. and make sure its done very slowly.

It is a life-saver.,This medicine is a mini miracle for me. I have had no problems with it at all. I know some are complaining about withdrawal symptoms but_from what I have heard that only happens to people who take higher dosages. I have never really experienced any of that.

However_ I am getting rather tired of the itching. Has anyone had this side effect?,Panic ruins your life. My tolerance has not increased over 10 years. Same dosage for 10 years.

My anxiety was making me feel as though my heart was pounding so fast_ it was going to bust right through my chest.  The first time I took my Clonazepam_ I had relief.  I am still have to care about things and be concerned about them_ but I do not feel drowsy or anything like that.  It has just taken the fear away and that horrible feeling like my heart is going to bust right out of my chest.  I don't take it everyday and when I do take it_ I only take 1/2 of my .5mg dose.  My prescription says to take 1/2 to 1 tablet a day_ as needed.  Unlike Buspar_ I do not have to take it every day (and the Buspar_ like I said before_ didn't help me.  I gave it a chance and I think because my doctor actually listened and gave me something that I was trying to give it a fair chance_ to no avail.).

It has taken me almost 3 years to decrease from 3mg to .5mg..  I am trying to get by on .25 and can't seem to totally discontinue.  The diagnoses as found in my medical records is: OCD_ Dissociative Identity Disorder_ MPD_ Bipolar Disorder_ Major Depressive Disorder_ Depression_ Anxiety_ Mixed State (psychiatry)_ Dysphoric Manic State_ Dissociative Disorder_ Borderline Personality Disorder_ Delusional Disorder_ Paranoia Disorder_ Major Affective Disorder_ Depression with Psychosis plus_ Psychomotor Retardation.  Because of the prescribed drugs_ I developed very difficult medical issues such as Gerd_ Sleep Apnea_ and Incontinence. The FDA needs to be aware of comments made on Ask a Patient_ perhaps people could get the help they need instead of being thrown into the legal drug system.  Good news: although drugged_ I awakened in mid 2007 with a clear mind_ researched the drugs_ began my decent and am alive once more.  I reluctantly take one medication_ a .25 clonazepam and it is still horrendous and very controlling.  I want to be totally free of clonazepam_ life has passed me by (over 30 years gone).

This stuff should only ever be given to uncontrollable maniacs IMO_ any other use does not justify the side effects. I am still Bi-Polar_ but treat it now with Lamotrigine (75mg a day). They only gave me the Clonazepam to help me relax on an evening if I felt anxious and to help me sleep well.

When that happened_ I would take .25 mg and would usually fall back to sleep within 20-30 minutes and wake up at my regular time feeling refreshed.  No residual effects.I never got dependent on it as I almost never needed it on the weekends and after about 2 months I was comfortable with the new job and had no trouble sleeping even without the drug.

97, 1, Taking clonazepam for sleeping,I took clonazemam for sleeping for about 10 years. It helped me sleep better and to get to sleep but I would never take this drug again. I was in the hospital for a kidney transplant and I had told the Dr's that I wanted to quit taking the drug. I found out later that they stopped it all at once at the time of the operation. Three days later in the hospital my legs started twiching and this strange tingling started to move up my whole body. I was shaking and trying to dig the hair out of my head. I could not stop the anxiety atack. They finally decided that it was because of not taking clonazepam. They started me back on it and I was better within an hour. This must be the most addicting pill out there. Am slowly trying to stop taking it now.,,M,70,10  years.5 mg 1X D,2/1/2011,Clonazepam
98, 1, anxiety and bi-polar disorder,this drug is incredibly addictive. my boyfriend and i have both been on it. i took it for 6 months and he's been takng it for around 6 years.we r both bi-polar. it's like poking an angry bull. i stopped taking it as i kept adding more and more pills per day because i didn't think it was working. however my boyfriend sometimes doesn't know when t stop. his speech is slurred and he is constantly forgetting what's going on and trips over things. this is prescibed by a doctor who supposedly curred his opiate addiction with suboxin. i guess i should be happy he doesn't crush it and shoot it ontop of heroin anymore....my bosses husband died from his klonopin addiction. he was 45. do we really need a drug this addictive being given to people with anxiety who may be suicidal??? you'd think our advanced medical industry could come up with something better. side effects: loneliness_ stupidity_ physical pain_ addiction_ sedation_ and death.,i wasn't always such a bitch.,F,29,6  years2mg 2X D,1/23/2011,Clonazepam

100, 5, Restless Leg Syn.,none except I sleep really good for the first time in 5 years,I read all the horror stories and wonder if I should continue but getting a good nights sleep with no side effects (groggy or depressed etc) I think its a wonder pill.  I have tried other things for the RLS that just don't work.   I used to laugh about people with RLS thinking it was a made up symptom...its not.  Anyway_ I can tell when I will not be sleeping well and take the pill 30 min. before bed.  Sleep great_ and wake up refreshed.  I would never take it during the day though.

101, 5, insomnia_ possible bi-polar,IMPORTANT: This medication will sometimes_ often-times take you into a deep sleep where you may have very vivid dreams; for me_ this happens rarely_ but are very realistic.,"IMPORTANT: reports of addiction may be true.  I have found that I can choose one or two tablets to sleep_ and my choice is usually correct. I have tried coming off Clonazepam several times and what I find is that I am not ""addicted"" to them_ but return to the exact_ same situation I had before starting...racing mind_ inability to stop having ""conversations"" over and over_ mentally ""re-doing"" all my mistakes and how I should have done different.  So_ in a way_ I am ""addicted"" in that I cannot sleep without them_ but I have no withdrawal symptoms as others have listed here.  NOTE:  I have tried taking them in the day for continued ""stabilization"" and find they make me very drowsy; I would caution those prescribed Clonazepam for daytime use to be aware of drowsiness.As to the bi-polar issue_ I am much less volatile than before BUT I do not take any other medication.  It is possible that I could be more ""normal"" with other medication included_ but_ overall_ I am satisfied with my personality.  It is_ for me_ Less Medication Is Better Medication.Hope this helped someone.",M,60,3  years1 mg 2X D,12/26/2010,Clonazepam
102, 1, Anxiety attack,Headache_ feeling of not caring about anything_ heart palpitations_ dizziness_ fuzzy thinking_ bad dreams.  After 16 days the effects of the drug was worse than the original attack.  It took me 30 days to wean off of it,The withdrawals were horrific and worse than the original attack.  I was on such a low dose but I still had to cut that little pill in half_ then a quarter_ then an 8th and then finally off.  The withrdrawals continued even after the 8th.  Withdrawals were severe headache_ anxiety worse than before_ ringing in my ears (which I had not had before)_ cold sweats_ heart palpitations_ nausea_ blurry vision.  I am still suffering from the vision difference but not every day now ( I have been off it now for 3 weeks).  I am having the cold sweats every once in a while still and a few anxiety moments which I am using prayer and reading God's word to get through.  I know there will be an end to this soon and I will be back to normal.  I will never take another mind altering drug for as long as I live!!!,F,48,46  days.5 2X D,12/17/2010Email,Clonazepam
103, 4, For Agoraphobia and disambiguation,- The only main side-effect I have noticed is that if you are a very active person and work out and such_ It cause some disturbances for the stomach_ due to its strong muscle relaxant properties. As well as skeletal muscle relaxation. And maybe dry mouth and yawning. Initially tho_ it was hard to even walk on 1.25 Mg_ but after about a month or so_ It goes away people! Especially if used every day_ at the same time and not abused. I have successfully tapered from 6mg_ in 2mg 3x daily to just the 1.25mg.,Clonazepam has a very long half-life compared to other potent Nitro benzos such as Xanax_ Nitrazepam_ and Temazepam. So for all of the people complaining about feeling slugish the next day when waking up or sleeping through the next day_ you all should switch from this medication. CLONAZEPAM SHOULD NEVER! EVER be prescribed for sleeping. There are much better benzo choices for insomnia. Take temazepam as a prime example_ and if your doctor refuses to switch you to that_ Try Bromazepam_ or even Xanax_ they all have short half-lives_ meaning they leave your system with in the day.So you go to sleep at 9-10 pm_ you take a temazepam (30 mg = 1 mg clonazepam)_ maybe you feel sluggish at around 8 a.m when you wake up. Drink a cup of tea or small cup of coffee and you wont AT ALL feel sluggish for the rest of the day. And I take this medication in the morning when I wake up... Because like I mentioned before it helps my mood and helps my anger to a great extent!,M,23,5  years1.25 1X D,12/12/2010Email,Clonazepam

Once I was even found lying face down on the shore of a lake_ near death from injuries I had inflicted upon myself whilst sleeping. Now I take 1-2mg before bed and I'm asleep within 15 minutes and don't suffer from any of the previous sleep issues.

I always believe in the minimum amount of medication to do the job. For me I simply broke the .5 in half. I stayed with .25mg daily for 6 months_ and keep a 30 day supply around for those few times I need it. This has been a miracle drug for me. A 30 day supply usually lasts me about a year or more.

128, 1, anxiety and panic disorder,My experience w/ clonazepam began about 10 yrs ago.  To make a long story short_ I became addicted. It led to polysubstance addiction - to alcohol_ oxycontin and crack cocaine. My boyfriend of 7 yrs is also addicted. He has overdosed 8 times_ 4 times in ICU. Yet the Texas MHMR still prescribes it to him if he goes to a new MHMR location.  This last time_ it started 1/4/10. He stole my car_ hocked all my tools_ spent $650 on crack w/ me_ went to jail for DWI_ then back to Tx.rehab at Homeward Bound. He left the rest of the Klonopin w/ me while he sat in jail. It caused me to blow my 9 mos total sobriety_ total my car_ ended up with a closed head injury_ cervical sprain_ which then led to severe diverticulitis and acute asthma from laying around taking clonazepam.  THIS IS A VERY VERY DANGEROUS DRUG. IT IS QUITE INOCUOUS AT FIRST - SEEMS LIKE JUST A MILD TRANQUILIZER.  THIS DRUG LEADS TO SERIOUS AND POLY ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR WHICH WILL KILL YOU.

There is an obvious addictive factor to it. I experience great anxiety and panic attacks if I go off it cold turkey like that. By the 5th day I am totally desperate! I don't like that. I do like it better than Ativan or Xanax. It does help me fall asleep when taken with my 12.5 mg Ambien. I also take 75 mg/day of Effexor XR and find that my depression_ anxiety_ and insomnia are kept at a minimum. I do NOT like being so dependent on Clonazepam but it's better than feeling panicky and anxious 24/7. FYI-recently tried Seroquel for insomnia instead at 150 mg/day.

130, 4, RLS,0.5 mg/day with really very few side affects. Perhaps a lowering of libido_ but this is not conclusively caused by the Clonazepam.,Allows me to function whereas I previously was unable to cope with the lack of sleep caused by RLS. I sometimes take 1.0 mg/day (before bedtime) if the RLS is bad. I feel drowsy and a little disorientated in the morning after taking the higher dose_ but this goes within a short time after waking. Have been taking Clonazepam for 20 years and haven't noticed a need to increase the dosage. I have been quite regimented with this aspect however and deliberately control the dose. If I don't take Conazepam_ then I cannot sleep (an obvious chemical dependence). I feel this is a small price to pay for a greatly enhanced quality of life.I dont think it stops or cures the RLS. Rather I think it allows me to get into a heavy enough sleep to not be disturbed by the RLS.,M,56,20  years,1/5/2010Email,Clonazepam

136, 1, Anxiety,Withdrawal!!! Tremors_ Migraine Headaches_ Depression_ Panic Attacks. Terrible!!!,I was prescribed this drug for panic attacks when my mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer last year.  My doc started me on .5 mg 3x a day and by Christmas she had raised it to 1 mg 3x a day.  I started having dissociative events_ I was numb to the grief when my mother died.  I had depression that worsened each month because I refused to up my dose any more.  I did not know I had developed a tolerance and started having withdrawal symptoms.  First I slowly withdrew from my husband and children_ & I started having migraine headaches daily. I could barely make it through my work each day.  I had tremors_ myclonic jerking_ suicidal thoughts_ painful joints and muscles_ and fever.  I finally looked up clonazepam withdrawal symptoms on the internet and I suddenly realized that these symptoms had crept up on me slowly each day until I was barely functioning.  My doctor had started me on gabapentin and I noticed that I was able to cut back my dose of clonazepam.  I have tapered it slowly over the last 2 months by myself_ my doctor does not believe it is addicting so she has not helped.  I have taken Magnesium and the Gabapentin to help.  I am now in day 5 of complete withdrawal and I am very miserable.  I had to completely take work off.  I have run fevers_ experiences dreadful insomnia_ and terrible tremors.  I wish had not trusted my doctor when she said it was not addicting.  Don't ever take this drug daily for more handful of weeks.  addiction is far worse,F,33,13  months,9/16/2009,Clonazepam
137, 5, Anxiety_ Panic Attacks_ Agoraphobia,Like others here have said_ the first 15-20 minutes after 1 0.5mg clonazepam is ingested_ I feel tired and even yawn a good bit but another 10-20 minutes later that wears off and I feel very relaxed and can actually take time to slow down and think about things that need to be done instead of panicking and stumbling over every errand or task.  Before this medication_ I would find my anxiety levels were heightened in public situations such as the grocery store or a busy shopping mall...without the medication_ my heart would race_ palms would sweat_ pupils would dilate and I knew this because I felt them enlarge...and inside I was simply freaking out.  Before I go ANYWHERE that involves large crowds and more noises than one can register and interpret_ I take 1 0.5mg typically early in the day or 30mins to an hour before going out...and once I arrive to my destination_ it has kicked in and I feel like I can conquer the world.  It relaxes me to the point I don't get that rushed feeling_ so,"If taken only when I need it and not daily_ it works wonders.  I have suffered from depression_ anxiety_ and post-traumatic stress disorder since I was a toddler.  I had adhd in preteen-junior high years and never went to a doctor for a diagnosis...so I self-medicated with an array of drugs...everything from ecstasy to lsd to prescription drugs that friends got and didnt want to take(paxil_ adderal_ etc)...eventually quit all the drugs and tried taking an anti-depressant but quickly stopped it because I was emotionally detached and that just wasn't for me because I'm the type of person that loves to socialize and have ""real talk""...love to laugh and make others laugh...I just unfortunately went through hell growing up so that's why I chose to experiment with drugs and I'm sure doing that at such an early age screwed up my developing brain...so now I just have anxiety...the depression comes and goes but it's never debilitating like it was when I was younger.  The clonazepam is a life-saver for my anxiety.  I do still have panic attacks if I'm in a car for a long period of time_ but letting the window down to get fresh air seems to help better than popping another clono.",F,22,4  months,8/12/2009,Clonazepam

It's taken me more than a month to get off it.  I've had panic attacks_ tremors_ paranoia_ dizziness_ muscle cramps_ and my insomnia is at it's worse.  I was never told about all the side affects or it's ability to hook you in.  If you go to a doctor_ make sure you do the blood work to assure your diagnosis and treatment is correct.  I am going to an internist but I am unsure about going the drug route. I will try other routes with prayer. This is NOT a good drug for long term use.,F,62,3  years,8/5/2009,Clonazepam

I'm the type of person that can do in 6 hours what takes someone else 8.At night unfortunately my mind doesn't stop the wheels turning.I have no problem going to sleep_ but it manifests itself in nightmares where I end up physically kicking and screaming in reaction to things I see in my dreams or even in my bedroom.  I even carry on a conversation with the g/f if she tries to calm me down.I usually don't remember this although if she reminds me the next morning it does come back to me a lot of times and then I can remember doing it.One dr gave me seroquel even though I not a depressant in any way shape or form. I took it and it paralyzes you. I guess that physically stops you from moving and acting out_ but in the morning I was so tired I couldn't move and I am the type of person that gets out of bed 1 sec after the alarm rings.Also after quitting the seroquel I can very much understand how it makes people suicidal. Luckily I am not a depressant and knew it wa,Anyway on those nights sometimes the nightmares come back so I don't know what I am going to do if I build up a tolerance to this stuff.So far really no major side effects. I'm was irritable before because I don't get the right type of sleep so still being irritable now is just the same effect but caused for a different reason.Probably a little short term memory loss_ but not enough to be detrimental.Me mellowed out is just taking me down to how a normal persons minds functions. I can see how these other people that have anxiety and stuff are having more severe side effects because thier mind isn't racing so stopping their synapses from firing is putting them in a more vegetative state. My problem is more antsy_ lets get stuff done_ always thinking 10 steps ahead type problem though and not being able to turn that off.

It was such a treat to go to bed and not wake up until morning!  My only complaint is that you have to keep increasing the dose as your body adjusts to it so this led to needing more and more.

I started off on .5mg_ then to 1mg_ but they were not helping with the anxiety. So I went to 2mg_ and it helped with the anxiety somewhat_ but made me very drowsy during the day. Just wasn't worth feeling tired and sedated all day_ as I also suffer from depression. I also had a high tendency to forget things easily_ especially in the short-term. I decided to stop taking this med and now have to deal with the withdrawal symptoms.,Trying to come off this med_ the biggest withdrawal symptom is being unable to sleep. I was only on this med for a couple of months_ and at a relatively low dosage (2mg)_ and I already developed a strong physical dependence on it just to simply go to sleep! Another notable withdrawal symptom is mood changes and becoming easily agitated. I would not recommend this med_ along with any benzo_ unless it is absolutely necessary and the side-effects (severe drowsiness_ being tired and having no energy) are worth it. For me it wasn't. Just trying to come off of it is a big problem. I recently switched to Busparine_ which is known to be less effective than benzos_ but do not come with the bad side-effects and withdrawal symptoms associated with benzos.

Would like to be able to discontinue the medication eventually_ since it is addictive_ but my brain/body are not ready yet.,F,47,6  months,4/29/2008,Clonazepam
181, 1, Myoclonus,Doc said I had Myoclonus nothing serious_ so he prescribe me 0.5mg of Clonazepam. I took it for 20 days then I didn't take on the 21st night and woke up in the middle of the night to drink some water and had the first seizure of my life_ went to the hospital. The ER docs said it was the withdrawal from the drug. The Neurologist next day said it wasn't. So told me to wean off_ took one more night 0.5 and the next 0.25mg on the 3rd night the one I didn't take the drug_ I had another seizure! Went to the hospital and the ER doc said the same thing_ withdrawal. Now the neurologist wants to give me another drug,. But I'm not thinking anything any more. I was healthy until I use this drug. Did some research online found that side effects and withdrawal side effects_ even though they are rare_ of the drug can be seizures! The doc never told me that! But in 10min I found what my seizure problem was! Not that I'm an expert but it was easy to track down after the second seizure. I wouldn't recommend this thing to my worst enemy. And now I will always do some research before I take any medication so I will know the side effects right up front. It's very important that we understand that medications are nothing more then DRUGS_ they are just legal. I was never a med fan_ now even more. I don't know how I'm going to stop taking it but I'm gonna wean off. I hope I don't have any more seizures but_ I'm willing to have them_ I just don't want other drugs in my body right now. I want to be healthy like I was 25 days ago. Good luck to you all and feel free to email me if you have the same problem.,M,26,24  days,4/25/2008Email,Clonazepam
182, 5, General anxiety,impulse control,I have never really taken any prescriptions but huge amounts of work related stress eventually made me seek some help.  Work had reached a point where it dominated my life and thoughts 24/7.  This prescription has been a god-send.  I used to fret about doing things and now I just do them (I consider this good_ take it as you will).  I have energy to do what I want to do and it helps me sleep when I need to do so.  It has given me much more confidence in work and social situations and has significantly improved my quality of life already by putting the comparatively little pains in life in perspective.  I'm slightly concerned about the apparent addictive nature_ but that's a risk I'm prepared to accept based on the huge upside it's providing my total life.,M,27,7  days,4/21/2008,Clonazepam
183, 1, Anxiety_ Panic Disorder,Initally it made me drowsy_ but that effect quickly wore off. After taking it for some time_ it started making me space out; which is completely unlike me. It sometimes even made me have heart palpitations; and I've been through several tests and I'm completely healthy_ so I'm assuming the palpitations came from this medication.,I wouldn't recommend this mediciation. It is overly prescribed and so many people are unaware of how habit forming it can be. Once you take it for some time it gets hard not to take it_ and you have to slowly stop taking it or else to get adverse reactions such as increased anxiety. After some time it didn't even help out the anxiety_ which it is suppose to do. Again_ I wouldn't recommend this medication; Always keep in mind the problems that this medication and other Benzo's cause.,F,20,45  days,4/12/2008,Clonazepam
184, 5, Generalized Anxiety Disorder,None really.  Feel great actually.,I've have issues w/ GAD/depression and chronic insomnia since age 19.  I have tried the whole gamut of Psych Drugs: Lexapro_ Prozac_ Zoloft_ Effexor_ etc...  All those SSRIs work great for a short period of time_ then all you have is side effects (especially the sexual SE's) and feeling tired all the time.  Finally after years and years my shrink put me on 0.5mg clonazepam daily_ to be divided into 1/2 tab dosing twice daily.  I actually just take it once daily_ after work_ and have a slightly addictive personality/history--yet I've never taken more than the prescribed dose in taking it for 3 years.  Nor ever had to raise the dose.  I do take w/ 300mgXL wellbutrin daily.  It's really mellowed out my anxiety_ which was crippling; I'm actually in a functioning monogamous relationship for the first time in my life. The thought of being dependent on a drug for life sucks. But the thought of driving yourself insane with anxiety is even worse I think.  I really don't feel high on the drug an,M,30,3  years,4/3/2008,Clonazepam

186, 5, anxiety / stress / worry,It makes me very sleepy initially_ but after an hour or so the drowsiness calms down and it leaves me feeling relaxed. Things that i'd freak out about during the day don't bother me half as much. I just let it slide - take things easy. I feel normal at last :) Sometimes_ I feel like a zombie_ sort of lose concentration for a brief moment but I don't mind because it's better than being a bundle of nerves and full of anger as I was before.,I take one tablet of 0.5 mg in the morning before work. The doctor perscribed twice daily_ but once daily does the trick for me. Plus_ I usually don't take it on weekends - i'm trying to use only a miminal amount for my own safety. Please do not take more than you need as it can be habit forming. Please try to make changes in your life that will help you relax in addition to this medication. Clonazepam is not a cure; it's a temporary escape from your problems. God bless...,F,27,14  days,3/31/2008Email,Clonazepam

188, 1, Anxiety_ insomnia,Extreme rebound anxiety and insomnia_ agitation_ loss of appetite_ nauseau_ diarrhea_ muscle spasms and tremors_ cognitive distortion_ depersonalization_ suicidal ideation.,This drug was touted as mild and non-habit-forming by the prescribing doctor. SHE LIED. It was hell while I was on it and even worse hell to come off of. Even though I tapered off over an 8-month period by having the drug compounded_ I still have some sfx (mostly physical) at 7-1/2 months off.

189, 4, Anxiety/phobia/panic attacks,Mainly i experienced a dazed_ zombie like effect with difficulty focusing or concentrating.  I also noticed I was getting more headaches and had a loss of appetite. I also tended to stumble while walking and had a hard time speaking.  Makes you extremely groggy. Noticed I forgot a lot of things and was more absentminded_ but it helped get my mind off what I was anxious about.,Despite the effects this drug does help with anxiety and the symptoms are better than the pain of anxiety.  I would recommend not to take more than two .5 tablets per day.  It helped me sleep and calmed me down after a severe break up.  My doctor put me on it as a precaution due to past experience with panic and generalized anxiety/ depression with no results from Zoloft. I would recommend to only take it as needed unless it is being used for some other physical reason.,F,22,1  weeks,3/11/2008,Clonazepam

At night_ my mind starts to wander_ which is where I find this drug VERY useful. It puts me in a ""happy"" place_ I really could care less about any negative things in my life. It really has helped me get past a terrible recent break-up_ and it helps me to sleep.Also_ some people say it makes them a ""zombie""_ but for me its the exact opposite.

She cannot prioritize things_ and has no emotions.,I found this website in frustration over what the so called expert doctors seem to prescribe this drug like candy.   I have read a lot of bad stuff about this drug and cannot believe they say start taking this and come back and see me in a month.  My Fiance is taking .05 mg 3 times a day.  Now she is failing in school_ our relationship is strained_ and all of her friends and relatives keep telling her to get off the meds because she walks & talks like she is a half zombie or on drugs.   And this is supposed to add to her quality of life ?   With all of the stories I've read about the addiction and side effects_ I only hope that because she has been taking it for about two months that serious damage has not been done.   She is supposed to contact the doctor today about getting off of Clonazepam_ she was suppoed to call him for the last two days but could not remember that we talked about it.Take my warning_ do not get on this drug or let anyone you love get on it_ it could destroy,M,53,2  months,2/20/2008,Clonazepam

194, 1, Social phobia/social anxiety,Hard not to get addicted to this drug due to its long half-life. The withdrawal was really_ really bad. Took more risks (and fell twice). Got too tough against other people.,What a hard lesson: Felt some anxiety and a very low sex drive when being on Sertraline 200 mg. Had been using it for about four years. Got prescribed oxazepam and felt great. Decided to try Klonopin (clonazepam). Was not knowing the side-effects. Worked well for one month or so back in april 2007. After about a month I had to increase the dose to get the same effect. More and more. By the end of june I understood something was wrong. Had gotten a bit too impulsive in relationships and was really tough. At work I did some mistakes and did not really care. In august the increase of dose was so high I became like a drug addict. Then read about the withdrawal symptoms. Decided to stop in oktober (took a vacation from work). Stuck on an about 6 mg of Klonopin during september/october was a really bad feeling. That vacation was the worst experience of my entire life. But that is another story.

I have taken Klonopin for years and I really thought that it was a great drug. But after a number of years I have continued to develope more and more problems from this drug. If you think its not dangerous and that it's not harming your body....try quitting! You will get a real dose of reality and what this drug is really all about. It's been the worse experience of my life and I continue to suffer from the side effects of taking Klonopin. I have since turned to holistic medicine and yoga and meditation. I have discovered that you can actually learn to overcome panic attacks instead of just suppressing them with a drug. The withdrawl symptoms are worse than coming off of heroine!

I took alprozelam for over 10 years and never developed any apparent dependence. I had no major withdrawal symptoms when I stopped it. I have had severe panic disorder since childhood and would not function at all without clonazepam. I began taking .5 mg 3X a day when my panic attacks returned full force. It provides much more even control throughout the day than the other med_ and without the adverse affect on my hormones.

I started with only 1-.5mg tab_ but grew tolerant of it and had to increase to 2 tabs at night and then to 3. I keep the extra tab only if I need it. I do feel dependant on this medication. Trying to taper off is horrible. My problem is due to a chemical imbalance. I also take Prozac 10 mg. twice a day. Have also tried to cut this down to 1-10 mg/day_ but felt ""lightheaded"" after a few weeks_ so had to go back to 2 tabs. I really don't know how I would feel if I stopped completely. I am a Registered Nurse.  Hate medication_ but better than those panic attacks. Also had Claustrophobia assoc. with these attacks.

It is more difficult to stop taking this then it is to quit smoking. I haven't had a panic attack since I have been on the drug_ but I recommend for others with this disorder to quit smoking and drinking. Exorcise 5 to 6 times a week 30 min. a day_ try yoga_ meditate and eat healthy and get enough sleep. Eliminate as all stress that you can from your life. This drug just covers up the symptoms of a larger problem.

Dosage was originally 1mg in the evening (around 7pm). This has been increased to 2mg in the evening likely due to long term tolerance of the drug. I have not experienced side effects until recently_ after taking the drug for 5 years. I have trouble remembering what I did the previous day_ or last week etc.  Short term memory is struggling. I then decided I would stop taking the drug.  It has been 2 weeks since I stopped cold turkey.  I wouldn't recommend stopping like this.  The withdrawal is severe.  This came as a bit of a shock to me as I didn't realise I was addicted.  The relief this drug gave me from RLS was good_ but as others have said - it is not a cure - just a good chemical 'mask'.

By taking only 1mg per day (night actually) I have no side effects whatsoever!  It is so much gentler than Ambien_ Lunesta_ Sonata and Rozerem and has no hangover effect.  In fact_ I never even notice any effect from this pill at all -- I am just able to get to sleep when I want.,M,34,6  months,9/3/2007,Clonazepam

223, 1, INSOMNIA,At first it works but as you continue your body becomes immune and you have to up your dose. When I have been out of it Horrible side effects. Feel very sick and out of control.,I have been taking this drug for 7 years. I have been to the ER twice because I thought I was having a heart attack. I was throwing up and would have body jerks. These are withdrawel symptoms. I take 4 mg. at bedtime. I want off this drug but am so scared of the horrible feeling's . My advice to you all is DO NOT GET ON THIS DRUG PERIOD!! It is highly addictive and very hard to get off of it. I do not know what to do. The Doctors offer no help! Anyone out there with any suggestions please help and contact me. I am truly scared.,F,46,7  years,8/16/2007Email,Clonazepam

I couldn't even think or work. I am tired of taking the medicine. This drug is something that really just covers up your problems. So what I am doing is solving my problems and tapering off the medicine and exercising. It's working but it's going to take I figure around 6 months to get totally off.

I take .5mg as needed up to 1.5 a/day tapered down from 2.5/mg. If I have a good sleep I will wake up feeling fine but if I take the medication in the morning I go on a spiral downwards for the rest of the day untill I am completly burntout.

231, 4, Anxiety/Panic Attacks,Sorry_ had to write again because I saw some of my comments were cut off. Here is the most important part...On a recent visit to my doctor I was informed that prolonged use of Clonazepam (such as mine 7+ years)_ can result in PERMANENT short-term memory loss. So_ as I mentioned_ please use this medication with caution and at all costs_ avoid long term use.,,M,34,8  years,6/11/2007Email,Clonazepam
232, 4, Anxiety/Panic Attacks,I have been taking Clonazepam for 7+ years now. I started at 2mg a day and now I'm currently at 0.5mg a day in AM.I have to say since I have been taking it for such a prolonged period of time I am experiencing many side effects from the medication. In particular for the past year or two as I am attempting to taper off the medication.I have experienced headaches_ dizziness_ vomitting_ sleeplessness (insomnia)_ extreme itching with no rash_ extreme sweating during sleep_ nightmares_ increased sex drive_ abnormal eye movements and twitching_ glassy eyed appearance_ slurred speech_ tremor_ vertigo_ confusion_ nervousness_ irratibility_ shortness of breath_ heart palpitations_ dry mouth_ increased appetite_ sore gums_ muscle weakness_ muscle pains_ fever.This is all over a period of 7+ years using the medication. I will say over the past year I've experienced the strongest side effects due to the fact I'm trying to taper off of it after taking it for such a long time.On a rece,I was suffering from anxiety and panic attacks. My only strong comment is use Clonazepam for what you need it for_ but avoid taking it for too long. It is addictive. I'm in a situation now where I really don't need the medication to function but I'm dealing with severe withdrawal symptoms.I've read some of the other posts for those that suffered or continue to suffer from anxiety/panic attacks. The medication is to help us function_ but ultimately we need to work on our issues in conjunction with the medication. If you suffer from anxiety or panic of going to speak infront of people_ or crowded buses_ or crowded shopping malls (as I did at one point)_ its very important to remember that we also need to work on other aspects of our lives to fix this_ not just rely on medication. Its confidence_ self-esteem issues that need to be addressed_ not just pop a pill and forget about the underlying issues.I've struggled for over a decade to address all the issues needed to be addressed.

233, 5, general anxiety/social anxiety,acidic taste in mouth_ lower sex drive (could be other med though)much more passive than usual,Developed a serious anxiety disorder 5 years ago. Was on/off meds for about three years. Was finally presrcibed Citalopram and it worked wonders for me. About 90% better. However_ approximately one day a week_ I would feel awful. Drained_ irritable_ exausted_ just miserable all around. Referred to them as a fooey head day and forewarned all the people around me if I was experiencing one so they would not take my actions seriously that day. If I was having a good day I would tend to overdue it to compensate for the possibility of having a fooey head day the following day. Was prescribed Clonezapam to chase this and has it ever worked! I take a half a .5MG pill whenever I experience a fooey head day_ which is about once a week_ two tops_ and the difference is incredible. I can focus_ I have steady amounts of energy_ I am pleasant_ can deal with customers without feeling a panic attack coming on_ and sleep wonderfully when I go to bed.

235, 5, extreme anxiety_ panic attacks,Prescribed 2mg 3x day_ 4 1/2 years_ but take .5 - 1 mg only when needed: overly anxious or agitated. For the more severe panic attacks_ 2mgs. will calm me down in 15-20 mins. One mg. before a known anxiety/agitation-provoking situation (eg_ staff meetings) works. Not addicting for me. Often go several days/week without taking it or thinking about it. It's short acting and is out of your system fairly quickly. It's a way different benzo. I could see possible addiction problems with valium because it has such a longer half life. Dependent on clonazepan only in the sense that it works. Changed my quality of life.,side effect - a little tiredness_ but not enough to interfere with activity if taken only when on edge,F,45,4  years,5/22/2007,Clonazepam

I'm now at 1 to 1 1/2mgs. 3 or more times daily.  I know I am addicted_ though not in the normal sense of the word.  The medication is made this way.  It is difficult since it is the only thing keeping me alive right now.  I HATE medication.  I want to do without.  Even knowing yoga_ meditation_ working out 4-5 days/week_ I know this won't work.  I tried.  I have to believe I will make it. (Done venting)Big sigh..It works.  My tolerance level has increased_ so I also had to increase the dosage.

237, 5, panic attacks_ epileptic seizures,Calmness_ Indifference_ Drowsiness_ Impairment of mental function: slowed thinking; vagueness and very precise enunciation during conversation.,I've been prescribed clonazepam for five months now. It helps with my panic attacks; works a trick in 15 mins. I find .25mg adequate. I am supposed to be taking clonazepam (.5mg) daily but i don't want to be dependent on a drug used to treat what is in my opinion a very unbecoming condition for a man of 18. I sometimes use .5mg before bed to help me sleep - it always does_ though i find i wake earlier after a very deep sleep. I think sustained use of the drug might cause dependency and withdrawal symptoms. Occasional abuse of clonazepam hasn't caused dependency or tolerance: once after I woke in the morning I ingested 1.5mg with three fingers of brandy. I had a 'second' sleep within 20 mins and didn't wake til 9pm.,M,18,5  months,5/3/2007,Clonazepam

Such as being scared of going in crowded places.. mall_ movies_ school.. or being being alone causes me panic.  However_ I have to say this pill has done a miracle and I don't suggest to take the pill on a daily basis. Daily exercise will help you over come anxiety and panic attacks.

It's been 5 days now and thank god_ it's not happening anymore_ or at least not as severe.

Family_ friends_ coworkers all noticed an immediate turnaround.  5mg 2-3 once daily a week does wonders to keep me relaxed_ no addition issues with that dose.  Replaced many other drugs that I had been taking due to side effects of a very anxious personality.,M,35,2  years,8/10/2006,Clonazepam
268, 5, anxiety,None,This is the only medication that has wiped out all of my anxiety.  I only take it as needed maybe once or twice a week.  I have tried Lexapro_ but it only worked a little.

I have yet to experience any dependency with this drug_ I go on streaks where I take it for a few weeks but then forget for several days.  It's not like the Effexor where I panic if I know I might be more than 24 hours without a dose.  The combination seems to be working allright.  Things are certainly better than they used to be.,M,27,7  months,6/16/2006,Clonazepam

I felt better instantly on Klonpin. Though I believe it to be addictive_ and I certainly wat off. Ive gone from 1mg per day to .5 a day_ and remain faily stable for the most part. An attempt to go to .25 hasnt worked well for me just yet_ and I just visited the hospital last week because the Klonopin couldnt get my heart rate down. Clearly I have some work to do in therapy_ so I can manage these attacks on my own and without having Klonopin in my bag. I SO look forward to that day.

277, 5, OCD,This drug has been a God send when having to battle chronic OCD/anxiety that has threatened to rule my life. Efexor is the only antidepressant to help my depression. I have tried all (and I literally do mean 'ALL' other anti depressants/combo's_ etc over the years). I feel extremely condident when I take clonazepam but I always pay for it later on. Apart from the tiredness_ memory loss an hour afterwards I get horrible cravings for cigarettes and alcohol. I don't drink or smoke normally. Although it has been a wonder drug for my OCD (I've had it since I was 6). I really want to get off Clonazepam or replace it with something else (I've tried Xanax but to no avail). If anyone else out there has 'cravings' for alcohol_ cigarettes I would grately appreciate it if they could email me their experiences. Many thanks,I take between 2-6mg a day_ depending on how bad my OCD is on the day. Also I would never have got through Uni (despite side effects) without it.,M,39,17  days,1/31/2006Email,Clonazepam
278, 5, Anxiety Disorder,I started taking this along with Effexor_ for combination anxiety & Depression_ so I'm not sure which side effect is attributed to which drug but - I had no appetite for weeks and lost 20 lbs_ and at this point the only side effect I have is tiredness.,Lifesaver!  I spent my entire life struggling with anxiety disorder and for the first time_ I almost never feel any panic.  I'm a full functioning member of society who never worries about panic attacks anymore.  I take 2mg a day_ every morning and weigh 106 lbs. (I suffered from some SERIOUS anxiety).,F,28,1.5  years,1/6/2006,Clonazepam

I no longer have panic attacks and find in my high stress job_ I am calm cool and collected.  This also has my moods balanced_ I no longer take any anti depressants and feel pretty positive about things.  I used to have suicide thoughts before taking this and I no longer do.  I don't think it's a miracle drug_ but it certainly helped me.  I am careful to not take too much as I heard it was addictive.  Having a great doctor helps too :),M,42,3  months,12/11/2005,Clonazepam
280, 5, ,I find this drug makes me lose my balance during the first few hours after I take it_ so I only take it at night.  It has a long half-life (~18 hours) so I don't really need to take it more than once a day.  I take 1.5 mg/day.,I tried SSRIs and other antidepressants_ to no avail_ and usually with the side effect of increased panic attacks.  I also tried valium_ xanax_ and ativan. Then along came clonazepam.  I wasn't depressed_ just had panic attacks_ and this has given me my life back.  I was able to go out and get a job_ and I have been able to travel numerous times across the country.  I don't worry about addiction_ because I struggled unsuccessfully for so many years to find help for panic attacks_ and now that I have found this medication_ I plan to take it always.  If for some reason during the day I start to have panic_ I take .5 mg ativan_ which works for a short duration and does not make me lose my balance.  ,F,53,12  years,10/24/2005,Clonazepam
281, 4, Anxiety,It is adictive but far easier to kick than cigaretts. It is the only thing that has helped with anxiety.

287, 3, Panic/anxiety attacks,I was prescribed 1mg to be taken 2 times daily as needed. As I was having negative side effects from paxil (hated it).  I weaned myself off of paxil against against my docotors advice (however I am working with a therapist who urges me to get off the meds) and went down to .5 mg of clonazepam and felt only slight withdrawl symptoms from the paxil.  I then tried to weak myself off the clonazepam further...thinking its only .5 mg's - i experienced 2 major panic attacks in one day.  I would really like to not be on anything at all but this seems to help keep the panic at bay.,,F,31,4  months,5/13/2005Email,Clonazepam

This included sleeping pills_ paxil_ ativan and even lithium (dont't go there if you can at all avoid it - very strange stuff!). It was difficult_ but I managed_ with great pride! However_ several months ago_ I began to experience severe panic attacks_ while driving no less.  As you can imagine_ this puts quite a limitation on your life - how in the heck do you get to work?  This would not do... so with great hesitation_ I requested relief from my doctor.  He prescribed the .5mg Clonazepam three times daily.  It is working like a charm and I feel confident and human once again.  He is trying other medication for me too_ like Paxil (NO)_ and now Celexa (NOT PLAYING THAT GAME AGAIN!) His concern is that I will become addicted to the Clonazepam.  I figure_ at my age and at the minimal dosage I take... who cares... as long as I continue to feel good and comfortable! It has truly changed my life for the better!,F,43,2  months,4/29/2005,Clonazepam

One tiny example _ inumerable others. Gradually became depressed. Lost any and all motivation to do ANYTHING! WhenI reported this to my Dr. at the time_ he sais he'd never heard of such side effects and increased my dose!! I'm weaning myself off the last 2 mgs. I was on 8mgs. daily for over 7 years!
