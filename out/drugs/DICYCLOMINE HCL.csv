0, 5, diarrhea_ crippling stomach cramps every morning,Tired_ but may be due to other things. Constipation_ so I lower the dose if necessary.,I used to wake up every morning with extremely painful cramps. Now_ taking one or 2 of these in the middle of the night prevents the extremely painful cramps that I had every day when I woke up in the morning. It is a miracle drug. This drug is both preventative_ and effective during an attack. Thank you whoever invented it!!!! No more fear about what will happen in the morning when I wake up!!!!!!,F,60,6  weeksas needed,7/23/2015,Dicyclomine hcl

2, 1, IBS,I had the worst pain one could ever imagine. I take Cymbalta for Fibromyalgia.  After 3 days had to quit it or would have lived at the ER for pain management.  Took two days to get it out of my system.  The drug may be ok for someone not on Cymbalta by my experience was horrible.,,F,,3  days10mg 1X D,5/6/2012Email,Dicyclomine hcl
3, 5, Stomach cramps due to gasses,Sometimes a little sleepe.,I take this medicine because I have a slow digestive process. For that reason I suffer from stomach cramps due to high level of gasses.

5, 4, IBS,Extreme cloudiness/dizziness. I can't take this medicine during the day because I become so out of it. But when the stomach cramps are really bad_ this medicine works wonders. I just need to be able to lay down!,Definitely helped the stomach cramps. I only take it when nothing else is working though since it makes me so foggy.,F,29,2  months,7/8/2008,Dicyclomine hcl
6, 5, Gastritis,Intense Graphic Nightmares (I could beat Stephen King if I wrote this stuff down)_ Drowsiness. With all that said this drug if the only drug that works for me.  The PPI and H2 blocker drugs did absolutely nothing but aggrevate my stomach and made things only 1000% worse. This Dicyclomine on the other hand is akin to a magical pill for me and probably saved my life! I couldn't eat for months if it wasn't for this drug! God bless the creators!!!!!,,M,32,1  months,12/19/2007,Dicyclomine hcl
