2, 2, Ménière's Desease,Lowering Potassium!! Jittery_ headaches_ Rheumatoid flares_ high liver enzymes_ vision problems,I am already on 20meq potassium 4 times per day. Doc said this was the pill that would help me from having vertigo attacks and also bring Potassium levels up. Started with good Potassium readings of 4.7 which have steadily dropped to 3.3 and a whole load of problems besides those mentioned above. My regular Phys. Says the Maxizide is the culprit of Potassium and other electrolytes going down_ liver problems_ and other side effects. It is now 5 days since  my lower dose of 1/2 pill (37.5-25) has been started. My potassium is going back up_ but my Rheumatoid flares that began with the higher dose is getting worse. I am to look for fluid retention_ but so far there has been none. My hands_ however are getting very stiff. I have more blood work next week. I am afraid lowering the Maxzide is going to start my vertigo attacks again_ but I can't live with lowering electrolytes and the other effects I was having.

8, 5, PMS then High Blood Pressure,None,This was a great medicaiton for me.  It was first prescribed for PMS in 1986.  I have been a diabetic since 1961 and as I got older and my blood pressure stayed stable my physician(s) left me on that medication.  I have now changed physicians and he has abruptly taken me off of Maxzide and I am not doing as well.  Before my blood pressure stayed in the 120/60 range and now it is in the 140/70 range.  My new physician continues to prescribe other blood pressure medications for me_ but so far nothing is working.  My new physician told me that Maxzide can be damaging to the kidneys_ and I did find information that supported that on the internet.  However_ the first physician that prescribed this for me was an endrocrinologist_ treating me for diabetes.  I don't believe that he would have prescribed a medication that would damage my kidneys more that diabetes would.  At this point my kidneys are fine.  Twenty-five years taking Maxzide and no kidney damage_ thus far!  Surely_ if Maxzide were doing to damage my kidneys it would have done so before now.,F,48,25  years75/50 2X D,1/9/2012Email,Maxzide

I was taken to the hospital ER and almost died there. The product contains sulfa drugs and I wasnt told it did because the detailing sales person who pushes this drug in the doctors offices and wines and dines the doctors to prescribe it forgets to inform him of this compound that could kill someone if they are allergic.

34, 1, Essential hypertension,"Muscle aches and cramps_ kidney stones_ renal (kidney) insufficiency.  Although I was prescribed this drug in 1994_ literature was not included with the precaution ""Possible exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus"".  I took this drug from 1994 through most of 2003 and at one point_ under the direction of a world-renowned rheumatologist_ was on 72 different tablets a day - all to combat the lupus brought on by the Maxzide.  In 2003 an alert FNP advised me of this literature and I was taken off the Maxzide immediately.  During the time I was on the Maxzide I sometimes prayed to die the pain was so great and I feel as though I lost nine years of my daughters' growing up_ their most important childhood years.  I am left with renal insufficiency_ kidney stones and an impaired immune system.
