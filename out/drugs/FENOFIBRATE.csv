0, 1, Triglyceride Reduction,"Painful symptoms in my right knee and my left knee. It took about 4 days for intense pain to subside and yet I still cannot walk without the felling of weakness and tenderness in the left knee joint_ tendons and or the meniscus areas of my left knee. Left knee now ""clicks"" and at times fails to function properly for confident walking.","Started taking this medication on 12-13-14_ within 3 days I stated to feel pain in my left knee_ after 7 Days of taking this medication_ (Fenofibrate_ 48mgs)_ I had to have crutch assistance just to be able to get around. Left Knee Pain was very intense and mobility was nil. I quit taking the medication immediately once my right knee started to develop the similar painful symptoms and a decrease in mobility as my left knee. I felt this was very unusual as I had not taken part in any activity or incurred any injury that would justify this type of pain and immobility. My concern and curiosity caused me to check for similar testimonies on various medical websites. My concerns were substantiated. I quit the medication immediately. Once I quit taking the medication_ the painful symptoms in my right knee went away by the end of the day_ but my left knee took about 4 days longer for pain to subside and yet I still cannot walk without the felling of weakness and tenderness in the left knee joint_ tendons and or the meniscus areas of my left knee. Left knee now ""clicks"" and at times fails to function properly for confident walking.",M,58,7  days48 mg 1X D,12/29/2014Email,Fenofibrate

2, 1, Not sure,Horrible respiratory distress.  Could not inhale oxygen into my lungs. Pain in shoulders and neck. Finally traced back to only change (by new doctor).  Quit taking immediately.  It has been 7 days off the stuff and I am so weak and exhausted I can barely walk thru the house.  Of course can't sleep well because of inability to inhale.  I hate this stuff and wouldn't recommend.  I just keep praying the symptoms will go away soon.,,F,59,15  days160 mg 1X D,5/21/2010,Fenofibrate
