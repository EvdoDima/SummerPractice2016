0, 5, Traveler's Diarrhea,I took Imodium during a severe bout of TD in Indonesia after eating some home-cooked food and unwashed fruit (getting sick was my own fault). I usually opt for natural remedies_ but after 48 hours of constant bathroom trips_ I needed to try something else. I figured my body had flushed out quite a good amount of stuff in 48 hours_ and towards the end I had extreme gas discomfort as well as occasional liquid stool. The combination was explosive -- not pretty. My entire digestive tract felt like it was quivering when I tried to eat so that even eating plain white rice was painful and I couldn't finish a small bowl.When it got to the point that I couldn't sleep because I had to get up every 5-10 minutes_ I tried just one Imodium pill (I am a petite female so often start with a half dose and find it's often enough). Symptoms subsided within 15 minutes and I was able to fall into a much needed deep sleep. The body best repairs itself while sleeping_ and the immune system doe,I should mention that during this time I also took large amounts of probiotics to replenish good bacteria that was lost during the 48 hours of TD. This likely also helped speed up recovery. IMPORTANT WARNING: Never take Imodium if there is blood or mucus in your stool. This could mean your TD is caused by a parasite rather than bacteria or virus_ and trapping a parasite in your system could literally kill you. So be very careful and self-aware when self-medicating. Imodium is like a light sedative for your digestive muscles. Instead of treating what's inside the gut (like Pepto Bismol and others)_ it slows down the muscles of your digestive tract so they move much more slowly and (in my case) stop spasming. This is why taking too much can be risky -- the toxins inside your gut aren't addressed and just sit there a while until your muscles calm down enough can push them out in one solid piece. Probiotics can help fight bad bacteria. Again_ just be careful to assess there's no blood in your TD before considering Imodium. Good luck and feel better soon!,F,33,1  daysOne tablet 1X D,3/5/2016,Imodium

10, 1, Intestinal virus/diarrhea,I was sick with an intestinal virus that caused fever and diarrhea. An NP recommended Imodium which I took on Sunday afternoon. I've been exhausted_ increasingly nauseous_ have a low constant abdominal pain_ and I am unable to have a bowel movement since then (now Tuesday morning).

12, 1, Travel,very bad stomach cramping and unable to have any bowel movements for 2 days now. It completely shut down my colon but now I am having very bad stomach pain. I would rather have kept the diarreah. I would not reccomend this at all as it is always best to just let your system empty out naturally.,Definitely stops diarreah or the feeling of having to go to the bathroom_ but it also does the opposite by eliminating any sort of bowel movement- not just the dirreah.,F,31,2  days,1/24/2010,Imodium

16, 4, severe IBS,dizziness_ fatigue,I have suffered from IBS for almost 9 years now. I used to take Lotronex until my new doctor advised me that it is not worth the potential risks of it. Instead_ he told me to take Imodium every day if need be. So for the past 7 months I take an insane amount of Imodium a week. However_ I have built a serious tolerance to it. I now need to take 18-20 pills before going out to a social event (in the past i need 8-12 to do the job). It does the job_ but I feel like it is unhealthy to take up to 50 per week. Also_ because I have such a severe IBS case I never become constipated. I usually have a bowel movement within a day or two.,F,25,7  months,11/17/2007,Imodium
17, 3, IBS-Diarrhea Triggered By Anxiety,Mild fatigue,I began taking Imodium because I get diarrhea whenever I'm in a social situation_ even if it is something as simple as taking a five minute trip with a close family member. At first_ the Imodium worked like a charm. Over the course of a few months_ however_ I built up a tolerance to it and it completely lost its effectiveness. Bear in mind that I had to take it every day.,M,22,4  months,8/13/2007,Imodium
