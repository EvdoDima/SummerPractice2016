0, 3, Breathing issues,I am more easily irritable than usual. I maybe wouldn't have known it was the drug at first as I usually feel there are legitimate triggers to set me off_ but I find that since I've been on QVAR it takes a lot less to ruin my mood_ sometimes things that should be really trivial.,The benefits are quite good. I used to need a puff of ventolin at least once a day to overcome feelings of breathlessness_ but since being on QVAR I have had to fall back on Ventolin 0 times.,M,49,30  days40mcg 2X D,8/17/2016Email,Qvar 80
1, 1, persistent asthma cough,It took me almost two weeks to realize that QVar is the cause of my 11 year old's frightening bronchspasms and complete apnea_ whether asleep or awake.  3-4 times a day she has an episode where after one or two coughs her throat completely constricts and she simply cannot breathe.  We have been through hell!  I also couldn't understand a sudden severe change in her mood and she has been talking about suicide and today opened the car door on the high way and told me later she wanted to jump out.  Do not give this medicine to your children!!!!,I am now afraid about weaning her off.  What can be worse than this?,F,11,2  weeks1 puff 2x,8/14/2016Email,Qvar 80

3, 1, Asthma,Headaches_ neck pain_ spasms_ the worst were in my throat it felt like my throat was closing_ high blood pressure_ anxiety_ itching_ dizziness_ and sore throat.,This is the worst medicine I have ever experienced. I went to my doctor for my thyroid and she put me on medicine for that and she also said I needed to get on qvar for my asthma. I went to the doctors countless of times trying to figure out what was wrong with me and come to find out it was the qvar all along. I have been off it for 3 days now and I'm still having a horrible time. I suggest no one ever touch this medicine it's been a nightmare for me.,F,25,3  weeks80,5/29/2016Email,Qvar 80

9, 5, Asthma,,There has been no other inhaled steroid that has helped me as much as Qvar_and I have tried many. It took a few weeks to really see a difference in my symptoms_ however it was well worth the wait. Qvar is not a rescue inhaler_ as I still use mine to open up during an asthma attack. However_ it has cut down on my use of them dramatically as my asthma is now better controlled. _ Any new inflammations in my lungs_ which trigger my asthma_ have diminished greatly_ I am diligent with mouth rinsing as per instructions to avoid thrush_ which I had once in all the years I have taken it which could or could not be related. Qvar has helped me immensely. I also take Singulair. Everyone is different_ as you need to find what helps you. But for me it's Qvar and Singulair that did the trick!,F,59,6  yearsQvar80,2/6/2016,Qvar 80
10, 1, Allergies induced Asthma,Our 7 year old has allergies to mostly Dogs and Cats_ lately due to pneumonia he was exposed to a German Shephard which induced an asthma attack in him and he ended up in the hospital. After that we went to seek help from Allergist_ after admitting some tests he prescribed QVAR_ saying it's better than SingulAir. About 2 weeks into his treatment_ nightmares starting to surface. He'd wake up screaming and scared_ also complained of leg pain_ his appetite seemed to suffer too. Reading previously about SingulAir_ these side-effects seemed familiar_ so we decided to take him off it as last 2 nights were sleepless. He has been off it for a day now_ last night was awful_ he would have night Terrors_ Hallucination_ tremors and shaking_ waking up in the morning not remembering anything. How dare they prescribe stuff like that to children_ which where I read mostly have these side effects_ they aren't doctors_ they're butchers_ lining up their own pockets.,We told the doctor it was allergies induced and most of the times he's fine_ he still went ahead and prescribed this awful drug. I hope the side-effects from withdrawal go away quick as I can't watch my child suffer from it like this and instead going to keep his away from animals_ keep the house clean_ change the diet and seek some natural way of helping him go through this.

Dr.,Prescribed Qvar because my doctor felt that because I cough occasionally (lying down_ hiking) he felt it was not under control.Recently got sick_ severe coughing pursued_ Qvar did not help.I was just told yesterday I have a mass in my lung. Additional testing is necessary. It may be nothing_ may be something. First chest x'ray after one year and I wonder if it has anything to due with using Qvar?I stopped taking Qvar for two weeks now. After seeing a different MD_ he agreed that I may only need a recue inhaler when I exercising/hike.

19, 1, asthma triggered by severe cold,Lost sense of smell after using QVAR. During one use_ I started coughing mid-puff and accidentally inhaled QVAR into my nose and sinuses. I experienced a terrible burning in my nose and face (in sinuses). I blew my nose several times to try and lessen the symptoms_ then went and got fresh air to breath as much as possible to flush it out. I never used the product again and from that day I have had a reduced sense of smell. My doctor said it was not possible to be related to QVAR use and didn't report to manufacturer.,"Whenever I get a bad cold_ it frequently ends up with breathing difficulties with symptoms like asthma. Doctor told me to use QVAR 2 x day whenever I started to get a cold and then use an albuterol ""rescue"" inhaler less frequently. After using QVAR about a week I had a terrible experience with one inhalation when I started to choke/cough and it ended up in my nose. No documentation says this has loss of smell as a side effect so doctor said it was all my imagination and he prescribed me a nasal spray which I didn't use. (How many times do male doctors tell women that? He's no longer my doctor.)",F,52,8  days80 2X D,6/28/2015Email,Qvar 80

21, 1, asthma,My son didn't need this. I told the doctor I didn't believe he had asthma_ he would have a little wheezing only when he was very sick. They made me doubt myself and give my son this medicine_ telling me that it would help his asthma completely disappear if his lungs got healthy before they are fully developed by the age of 12. I trusted them_ now 14 months_ two weeks and two days later_ I realize he's got something called a Buffalo neck and he's developing a moon face. I thought he looked different but thought it was just a growing stage. My beautiful son_ who I believe was never asthmatic because he could swim was active and running etc. with no problems_ is now overweight_ has sunken eyes_ his cheeks are fat and he's got a lump on the back of his neck. Looking at most of the people they didn't use this junk medicine for more than a few months and I stupidly let my son use it for so long. This has caused more damage and I worry about my son's mood swings and his speech is hoarse. It turns out this doesn't even help with wheezing and my son has grown only a half inch in six months. Who can I sue for this stupid medication ruining my son's health? Will this all go away and can I stop this immediately without any additional problems? I'm so upset.This drug does more damage and doctors should know better than to give it out without telling us the side effects. The doctor kept telling me that taking him off is wrong but I should have listened instead to my maternal instincts.,,M,10,1  years40mcg,5/25/2015Email,Qvar 80

31, 1, asthma,"It seemed to help at first. Then I caught a cold at Christmas. I had a hard time breathing. Rescue inhaler or nebulizer didn't even help. I could see the Qvar wasn't helping anymore. Saw the dr. on call. Bronchitis. Given antibiotics. He refused to give me Prednisone for just a week_ but then suggested a cortisone shot_ AFTER my telling him I had a bad reaction to that last year...Do they even listen? I refused it this time. He increased the Qvar_ said it should work after antibiotic starts to work. (Didn't) I am also itching_ all over_ after the increased dose. And I have been told recently that I am developing cataracts. Already have had sore throats_ hoarseness and headaches from other steroid inhalers that didn't help.I don't like taking these steroids ALL of the time!! I have taken other steroid inhalers for at least 10 years. And now the rest of my body is paying for it_ all because doctors are quick to give us this stuff without really thinking about side effects_ and cost!! It is outrageous!!!The old CFC inhalers worked much better_ a couple times a month. Now because of a ""supposd threat""_ we're stuck with the HFA inhalers_ which DON'T work nearly as well. CDC says_ well_ take a deeper breath. When we are having asthma attacks_ we CAN'T take a deeper breath!!!!Ignorant people making laws to please a few_ taking our EFFECTIVE MEDICINES AWAY_ AND charging us obscene amounts for second_ or third rate meds that have worse side effects.",FRUSTRATED??? You bet I am!! I have already started to taper off this one. When it is gone_ I am done! I resent the idea that doctors get us started on these with mild asthma_ then our systems get dependent on them. I sure hope I can have a quality life without them_ just using Singulair tablets_ nebulizer and ProAir when needed.

37, 2, Asthma,Rating this for my 14 yr old daughter.  She was not taking her medication regularly for more than 6 months.  I was always on her to take it.  She would tell me she feels worse or sick when she takes it.  I would argue that she needs to take it steadily in order to truly tell if it works for her.  She has been taking it steadily for the past 2 months and she is throwing up pretty much every other night.  Now that I see she is taking it_ I know it is the QVAR 80.  She is very nauseous even on the nights she does not throw up.  We have an appointment with her Allergist_ but I am definitely going to call him.  She has also experienced lots of heartburn and itching too_ which I didn't realize was a possible side effect until I looked it up today.,,F,14,1  years2x 2X D,8/14/2014,Qvar 80
38, 1, Mild Asthma,Have never been on any long-term prescription in my entire life so was unhappy to have the experience of an initial short bout of dizziness after two weeks of use but then severe dizziness_ including Vertigo_ after 30 days of use and to the point of nauseousness and vomiting. The total time of being incapacitated was 4-5 days. Went off the medication 3 weeks ago and this week I am still experiencing the side effects of dizziness_ going on for 3 days now..,The sad part is that upon my specific inquiry to the physician as to the safety of this medicine_ she said there are no problems with this medication.  That was a hint right there! Will try an allergist next as my reaction is considered a serious allergic reaction to the medicine and I don't intend on using an inhaler in the future.,F,57,1  months2 puffs 2X D,5/22/2014Email,Qvar 80

Itchiness is listed as a serious side effect_ but the doctor doesn't believe it is the drug. I do though.

40, 1, Asthma,After taking theophylline for 30 years or so I gave this a try and it worked very well controlling my asthma symptoms. Soon after I begin taking it I started to experience pain in my upper arms. I am a contractor and at first I chalked it up to work. In December however I was off work the entire month yet the pain persisted. When I went to bed at night the pain would sometimes become severe. The pain in my left arm has mostly abated but the right arm ( I am right handed) has become worse than ever_ bordering on excruciating at times. I decided to stop using the qvar and the pain has since subsided. The pain was from the top of my shoulder and down through my arm to my elbow_ and felt as it pulsed all the way through to the bone.

46, 1, virus-induced asthma,Sobbing_Irritability_Weeping_Inconsolable crying for 4 days,My 22 month old was prescribed QVAR 40 as an alternative to Flovent. After reading the terrbile side effects of Flovent_ I was happy to try QVAR instead. I gave my son 2 puffs of QVAR once a day_ each morning for only FOUR DAYS. Starting the first day_ his behavior was clearly different. My son is such an easy-going_ always happy boy. He almost never cries. Even when he is teething all of his molars and has a bad cold_ he hardly complains. The first day on QVAR_ he cried all day long. He was so easily upset_ very irritable. I had never seen him so WEEPY. He was just crying ALL DAY LONG_ inconsolable. I have never seen anything like it. We continued QVAR for a few more days to see if this crying would improve_ but it did not. My son WEEPED_ crying for FOUR DAYS. The QVAR was the only change in his routine_ so this was clearly an effect of the drug. NOT ACCEPTABLE. I will never give him this medecine ever again.,M,1.5,4  days40 mcg 2X D,3/27/2012Email,Qvar 80

I have terrible asthma and have for 12 years and tried various medications. This drug helped the asthma but made me otherwise unable to function.  I was terrified until the drug ran its course for that dose and I went back to normal.  I have dediced to get off all inhaled steriods because I have experienced side effects with all of them; thrush_ weight gain_ vertigo_ migraines.
