1, 1, Hepatitis C,stroke level high b/p_ suicidal thoughts_ tinnitus_ vertigo. Non stop thoughts racing. Neck pain_ joint pain_ everything pain! I was aggressive then sink to a deep dark place. Scary_ it was the worst med I have ever taken.,"My labs were within range_ in recovery 33 years_ no alcohol no drugs. My hep C was probably acquired at least 33 yrs ago. Reluctant to open a hornets nest as I was feeling fine. This med was almost FORCED on me_ I begged the doc not to put me on it_ they made me feel like if I didn't take it the doc wouldn't see me again. Just the pressure alone told  me it was a red flag. I am sensitive to meds_ doc PROMISED NO~ZERO sides. Teaching hospital I was told NO SIDE effects that also left an odd feeling you can't predict who will feel what. Three days into it I know I couldn't tolerate it_ my b/p that was stable was 190/120 when I arrived at the docs office. I was scared out of my mind_ lost touch with reality_ felt really suicidal_ and NO I am NOT suicidal. I would go from rage to a deep dark place all within a few hours. I had non stop tinnitus_ migraine with aura and my neck felt and still does like it was in a vice. Every joint hurt_ it was the worst med I was ever on and I have tried a few. Doctor was not being honest when she said just like the company does when you call their hotline_ ""you are the first one to report_ or no one else every reported"" NOT true. Now about a year after the med has been on the mkt people are feeling like me_ duped_ lied to. We were not told the side effects and they are POST treatment. Many of serious sides like I do. I went off in 2 weeks the only way I could stay on was to be hospitalized I told the doc and I meant it. Now off",F,63,14  days90/400 1X D,7/12/2016,Harvoni
