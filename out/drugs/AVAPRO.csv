Always tired no matter how much I slept. i was okay at first_ symptoms didn't show up until about 3 months after I started on meds.,Pay close attention to your body and read all warnings.

4, 1, high blood pressure,I never felt like I was depressed until alot of these comments I read describing their mood were exactly the way I feel & be everyday. Extremely cold feet_ skin irritation_  voice sounds hoarse with dry mouth_ bp up & down its never stable it's still high_ dark kneck. My doctor now trying to say I have diabetes but he told me I don't have to really check my blood sugar. I've been begging to be taken off these pills b/c of my symptoms. I've been complaining since day one. I'm so upset with myself. I'm getting a referral to a hypertension specialist.,They are trying to hide the fact that this medication causes diabetes symptoms. ,F,38,1  years150/12.5,3/30/2016,Avapro

6, 2, HPN,After 4weeks red blood spots started to appear on the outer of my upper arms and then on my lower legs and feet. They got progressively darker & bigger. My Dr thought it could have been the asprin I was taking daily_ but after stopping that for 4 days did not change the condition. It got worse & was now appearing on my chest. I looked up as much info on Avapro side effects. There it was - ? rash with raised purple spots and flat red areas caused by inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis). So I will stop taking Avapro immediately now that Ive read this. I also had an increase in muscle cramps during this period_ including a number of areas of the body that I had never had cramp in before.

12, 3, Hypertension,"I am wondering after reading the comments on this site if I too have an issue with Avapro.I have been taking this drug since Cardiac Bypass surgery in 1994 and have developed the symptoms of 'Inclusion Body Myositis'. I am wondering if those symptoms have been caused by the Avapro. I have lost massive amounts of muscle strength in my lower torso and find it near impossible to get up off the floor with any ease.I have the Headaches_ the Dry Throat_ the Sore Neck_ the extreme malaise_ etc..etc. etc.I am also aware that I am a person that reacts to the ""Not many people experience these symptoms"" part of the information about any given Med. I will talk this through with my Doctor with a view to experimenting with my Avapro dose and repost a report some time in the future. What has really made things worse is the addition of an extra med into my regime(and NO it is not that med as I have isolated it already. It is as if a switch has been turned that intensifies all of my 'usual",It would be good if there was a rating added that allowed a person to indicate that their satisfaction level wasn't conclusive as yet.,M,67,20  years300 1X D,1/27/2015Email,Avapro

I don't understand why my breathing is greatly improved to where I don't need my advair_ but I'm not complaining. Will slowly build to proper dose and keep watch on my blood pressure. I'm sensitive to many drugs_ so it's not easy to find one that works for me. Personally_ I think that doctors go with the ordinary dosage and alot of times it's too much.
