Always tired no matter how much I slept. i was okay at first_ symptoms didn't show up until about 3 months after I started on meds.,Pay close attention to your body and read all warnings.

4, 1, high blood pressure,I never felt like I was depressed until alot of these comments I read describing their mood were exactly the way I feel & be everyday. Extremely cold feet_ skin irritation_  voice sounds hoarse with dry mouth_ bp up & down its never stable it's still high_ dark kneck. My doctor now trying to say I have diabetes but he told me I don't have to really check my blood sugar. I've been begging to be taken off these pills b/c of my symptoms. I've been complaining since day one. I'm so upset with myself. I'm getting a referral to a hypertension specialist.,They are trying to hide the fact that this medication causes diabetes symptoms. ,F,38,1  years150/12.5,3/30/2016,Avapro

6, 2, HPN,After 4weeks red blood spots started to appear on the outer of my upper arms and then on my lower legs and feet. They got progressively darker & bigger. My Dr thought it could have been the asprin I was taking daily_ but after stopping that for 4 days did not change the condition. It got worse & was now appearing on my chest. I looked up as much info on Avapro side effects. There it was - Â• rash with raised purple spots and flat red areas caused by inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis). So I will stop taking Avapro immediately now that Ive read this. I also had an increase in muscle cramps during this period_ including a number of areas of the body that I had never had cramp in before.

12, 3, Hypertension,"I am wondering after reading the comments on this site if I too have an issue with Avapro.I have been taking this drug since Cardiac Bypass surgery in 1994 and have developed the symptoms of 'Inclusion Body Myositis'. I am wondering if those symptoms have been caused by the Avapro. I have lost massive amounts of muscle strength in my lower torso and find it near impossible to get up off the floor with any ease.I have the Headaches_ the Dry Throat_ the Sore Neck_ the extreme malaise_ etc..etc. etc.I am also aware that I am a person that reacts to the ""Not many people experience these symptoms"" part of the information about any given Med. I will talk this through with my Doctor with a view to experimenting with my Avapro dose and repost a report some time in the future. What has really made things worse is the addition of an extra med into my regime(and NO it is not that med as I have isolated it already. It is as if a switch has been turned that intensifies all of my 'usual",It would be good if there was a rating added that allowed a person to indicate that their satisfaction level wasn't conclusive as yet.,M,67,20  years300 1X D,1/27/2015Email,Avapro

I'm sensitive to many drugs_ so it's not easy to find one that works for me. Personally_ I think that doctors go with the ordinary dosage and alot of times it's too much.

I was diagnosed with tarsal tunnel syndrome and about to have foot surgery. I was sent to a neurologist for an emg to measure amount of nerve conduction in ankles - he mentioned that my medicine could cause joint and muscle pain.

My doctor and I settled back with Avapro which seemed to work fine with no other side effects.  I have been on it for seven or eight years and attributed the ""minor"" maladies above to the aging process. I didn't know that Avapro was causing all these sypmtoms until I accidentally forgot to load the Avapro in my vitamin case one Sunday.

I could now spring up out of the chair and bolt up the stairs with no stiffness_ no discomfort.

I am in the 1% of users who experience an allergic reaction to Avapro. Symptoms include dry skin_ deep skin hives_ and intense itching especially on the upper arms_ abdomen and back. I had an extreme reaction yesterday which resulted in going to urgent care. The physician immediately connected my angio edema and widespread hives with Avapro. He advised me to immediately discontinue using it. I stopped taking it. Last night the itching had diminished and for the first time in a year I am not itching. It was tormenting to itch all day and night.

112, 4, HTN,Possible mild back pain.,I have been taking this medication for about 2 months_ and it has lowered my B/P by about 10 mm/Hg systolic and diastolic.  I do want to comment that most of you out there that are complaining of dizziness/ tiredness need to know that this is a common side effect of taking any blood pressure medication.  For those of you saying you become dizzy/ light headed when you stand up_ this is a phenomenon call orthostatic hypotension (sudden decrease in blood pressure as a result of you standing quickly)_ which is also a common side effect of any blood pressure medication.  To those of you like me experiencing muscle pain/ weakness_ you should consider changing medications if these side effects don't go away within a few weeks of taking this medication.  Just as a reference I am taking 150mg.,M,21,50  days,4/23/2009,Avapro

114, 1, HYPERTENSION,Unexplained mood changes that eventually led to sexual and emotional elimination completely!,My husband began taking this medication within months of our marriage and as a result_ his sexual and emotional desires began to change and he did not know why. He reported this to the doctor and was then placed on Levitra which did not help. So the doctor simply chalked it up to stress. In the meantime_ he was becoming more and more distant emotionally to the point that now there is absolutely NO intimacy whatsoever even in the conversations. We were together nearly 2 years prior to this and never had these issues! The initiation of Avapro is the only thing that coincides with his emotional changes and we looked up the side effects about a week or so ago_ SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION is at the top of the list of side effects not requiring medical attention. We have contacted an attorney because of this effect on our marriage (not quite 4 years yet). So if anyone is going through similar changes_ please_ please contact us!!!!! He was taking this for 3 1/2 of our 4 years as a married couple and we've been together for nearly 2 years beautifully before the initiation of this forsaken drug!,M,43,3  years,4/18/2009Email,Avapro

181, 3, high blood pressure,Concentration_ ADD or ADHD.,My spouse is on Avapro & I went with him for his check up and asked the doctor if it would have an effect on concentration or if the high blood pressure would have this effect.  THE DOCTOR SAID THAT THIS WAS NOT A SIDE EFFECT OF THE MEDICATION.  Could it be a side effect of the blood pressure?  Ever since the diagnosis & prescription_ I have noticed that he seems more hyper than before - he was always very active_ but (now) sometimes will start to do something & suddenly go away to do something else & I wonder what happened.,F,50,6  months,6/12/2007Email,Avapro
182, 3, High Blood Pressure,debilitating hip and leg paininsomnia,It has lowered my blood pressure very well.  However_ over the past couple of months I have been experiencing increasing pain in my hips down to my knees. My doctor doesn't think it is the medication and has recently sent me for x-rays of my hips to check for arthritis but after reading other accounts I am convinced that it's the drug.  The onset of the hip pain was quite sudden and my doc now has me on anti-inflammatory medication which isn't helping much. I am finding this pain debilitating.  Getting out of bed or up from a seated position I am so stiff and sore I am limping and stumbling. It gets a bit better once I start walking around. I never had this problem before taking the drug so I don't think arthritis would set in so quickly or so severely.  Other than this side effect_ I have had some insomnia but the leg pain is by far the worst.,F,47,8  months,6/11/2007,Avapro

189, 2, hypertension,After taking Avapro for several years_ a few months ago I noticed extreme dry mouth_ cracking in my tongue_ metallic taste in my mouth and a burning sensation in my mouth.  I have seen 6 different doctors and had countless blood tests -- all normal. I am taking the 300 mg dosage daily and wonder if it is too much for me.  At the onset of the mouth symptoms_ I also started a more rigorous exercise program and wonder if the two are related.  Anyone else suffer these symptoms?  I used to take Cozaar and had absolutely no side effects at all.,Until I find out what is causing my mouth pain and tongue cracking_ I wouldn't want to recommend Avapro to anyone.

194, 2, hypertension,I was on Avapro for about 3 years_ but over the period_ aches and pains in joints became extremely debilitating.  Initially blamed arthritis and/or getting older.  Walking any distance was becoming very difficult.  After looking up 'side effects'_ went immediately to the doctor.  Not heard of this reaction_ but checked his own source - one person in 1000 suffers badly from severe aches in joints.  Went back onto my previous long term medication (Inderal_ a beta-blocker) aches and pains vanished immediately.

197, 2, high blood pressure,"I took avapro for about 7 months before I started having significant side effects. Looking back_I remember having a lot of indigestion.Then things got worse:hip pain_ abdominal bloating and discomfort_ and also back pain unlike any I have had before. I was going to a chiropractor that in the past has always helped any back discomforts get better_ however_ as I told him_ this time it was ""just different""_ and it wasn't getting better. I did realize that if I forgot to take my avapro during the day_ some of my discomfort eased. I then found this web site that alerted me to some similar responses others were having. My doctor didn't think it was the medicine_ so ran lots of test_ only thankfully to come back normal. I then had a strong feeling it was the avapro making me feel so awful_ needing to lay down most all of the time. I stopped taking it and within a few days I was feeling much better. I did get a different perscription for blood pressure medicine that so far is doing t",It got my blood pressure down_ but it wasn't worth feeling so terrible from the side effects.,F,44,8  months,9/19/2006,Avapro
198, 1, High BP,First on 150MG_ developed minor cough. After 1 month Dr. upped the dose to 300MG. Developed BAD Cough_ Irregular heartbeat and drug aggravated my Acid Reflux disease_ (which had been under control with 20/25mg Prevacid).,While it did (at 300mg) lower my BP_ I could not tolerate the side effects.

Doctor lowered dose from 300 mg to 150 mg and no more side effects.,300 mg took my BP from around 215/110 to 112/72.

It was difficult to walk without feeling achy. Climbing stairs_ etc. was excruciating if not done at a slower pace. This drug caused muscle damage (elevated CPK)_ supposedly reversible when discontinued.  Just a general feeling of fatigue inspite of exercise and moderate activities.  The side effects was tolerable at 150 mg._ but was unsafe to use with elevated SED rate/CPK's. It controlled bp_ but not worth taking when quality of life is compromised and other bigger health problems arise. Monitor your health carefully through blood tests when taking any Rx drugs.,F,,2  months,8/22/2006,Avapro
201, 5, Hypertension,I have been taking Avapro 150 mg for almost eigth years and it decreased my BP significantly. About three months ago I developed severe pain under my right shoulder blade that went through under my right breast and on my right side under my arm. I have been to ER four times and no one has been able to find the cause of the problem. I have seen 5-6 different doctors in different specialty areas_ no luck. I finally met with a digestive specialist who thinks the this medication may have affected my pancreas. I have also recently been diagnosed with diabetes. The pain is there everyday. I am waiting to visit with my cardiologisst to have my medications adjusted/changed. Will write if the pain goes away with the discontinuation of the Avapro.,,F,53,8  years,7/22/2006Email,Avapro

By the third day had to be taken by ambulance to e.r. with difficulty in breathing! The e.r. docs thought it was the Lipitor I was taking so I was taken off that but had to return to the e.r. when the symptoms were worse than ever.

Also_ I noticed some tingling in my right ear followed by a slight headache,I was on Toprol 25mg (which was a terrible med) prior to my MD switching me to Avapro 150 mg. It took me almost a month to slowly wean myself off the Toprol. Some of the side effects I noted could be from Toprol and not Avapro. I'm not sure. However_ since I started taking Avapro about 1 month ago my bp has been in control and the brain fog_ panic attacks and anxiety that resulted from Toprol have decreased significantly. I started taking half the 150 mg pill while weaning myself off the Toprol. I noticed that my bp didnt go down by much on 75mg (half pill) until I started taking the whole pill. I definitely feel much better on Avapro. My current reading is 128/76 down from 156/95.,M,38,1  months,3/14/2006Email,Avapro
