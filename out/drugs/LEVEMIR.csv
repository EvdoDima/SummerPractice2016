0, 1, Die,None,Used Levemir for more than 18 months without appreciable results. Reading remained in the low to mid 200's.Switched to Lantus and saw immediate results. Sugar reading declined by 60 points and reduced dosage to 60 units once per day.  Once had hypoglycemic reaction where BS levels went to 72.While Levemir is on some insurance carriers formulary and Lantus is not_ I recommend that you ask the insurance company for an exception to allow the use of Lantus.,M,70,18  months60 2X D,3/30/2015,Levemir
