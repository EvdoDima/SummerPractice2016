0, 5, Sciatica_ Herniated discs,Dry mouthSweating Hyper-Verbal,I was referred to a Pain Center after I delivered my twins. I had severe sciatica and 2 herniated discs. I was prescribed Oxy IR 5 mg capsules (they no longer make them here) To take up to 4 times/day. They worked wonders. As time went on_ they increased the dose to 2 Oxy IR 5mg tabs every 4-6 hours daily. My doctor wanted me to go on the OcyContin 12 hour pills and I refused as I had 2 young children i had to care for in the home. The Oxycodone are instant release and cause no drowsiness and are out of my system in 4-6 hours. They work perfect for a mom of twins.,F,45,10  years10m/4-6hrs,4/19/2016,Oxycodone hydrochloride
1, 5, As Needed for Migraine's,As I take Duragesic 75mcg/hour (FENTANYL PATCH) applied every 3 days for chronic neuropathic neck pain_ and represents about 180mg of Oral Oxycodone over 24/hrs_ when i take a dose of 40mg of Oxycodone IR at once it can be overly sedating and can effect my motor skills. Therefore following tasks at work or operating a car etc are the only problematic side effects i get other than itching which is extremely irritating_ also my eyes become very dilated and I look like a drug addict. Otherwise this medication is exellent.,I have the 10mg and 20mg formulations and get 60 count of each. Each Label Says: TAKE 1 OR 2 BY MOUTH EVERY 4 HOURS AS NEEDED.Therefore I take anywhere between 10mg_ 20mg_ 30mg_ or 40mg at once every 4 hours when I needed it for migraine's and Neuropathic Neck pain flareups (which I take DURAGESIC 75ug/hr every 3 days (72h). This is the equivalent to 180mg to 240mg of Oxycodone every 24 hours. Or 320mg to 360mg of Oral Morphine Every 24 hours.,M,30,18  months10 & 20mg 2X O,1/16/2016Email,Oxycodone hydrochloride
2, 5, Back Pain _ Neuropathy,"I started taking this 15 years ago _ for chronic back pain. At first _ 2 a day _ and it helped tremendously.    Over the years _ after Working on my feet For 40+ years _ I developed neuropathy in my feet and lower legs ....They tried several exotic and ineffective drugs that didn't work.   I couldn't stay on my feet for more than an hour at a time.    Finally_ I convinced them that the oxycodone was the Only thing that helped .  I have been taking 4 a day for the last 6 years _ and they allow me to live a pretty normal life .     The only complaint I have is the stigma that the media and the medical establishment have attached to the drug _ which is ....If you take it _ you're an addict !  They pass out Poison like it's candy _ but something ""tried and true "" like oxycodone_ they assume you are an addict _ and try to treat you like one !  Don't Let 'Em !!",Absolutely a lifesaver for chronic pain !,M,67,10  years5 mg,12/28/2015,Oxycodone hydrochloride
3, 2, Tonsillectomy,Constipation_severe nausea_ vomiting.,I was prescribed this medication following surgery to remove my tonsils. It worked well for the first 2 or so days. But then the pain got bad enough to need 2 10mg pills ever 6 hours as perscribed. That still didn't put a dent in the pain_ it seemed to only work for about 1-2 hours_ then I had to suffer through the next 4 before I could take it again. After a day of taking 20mg of the medicine I became extremely nauseated and had a bad bout of vomiting_ enough to get perscribed anti nausea medicine for chemo patients. I was told to lower the dose_ but the pain was so bad I found myself needing to decide between vomiting and a little less pain or just suffering through. Perhaps it was just an extremely rough surgery_ I did everything I was told for recover_ probably drank my weight in water each day_ just couldn't get the pain to go away.,F,20,1  months10mg,3/2/2015,Oxycodone hydrochloride
4, 4, lumbarDDD spinal stenosis arthritis,Mild consipation remedied with MiraLax which is great stuff_ highly recommend.,"One 30mg wasnt enough for pain relief. Two was too much. Like baby bear 1 and a half was ""juuuust right"". When taken responsibly and as precribed this med offers great pain relief. During the winter I slipped and fell in the driveway and of course this made for some extreme pain for several days. I took more than prescribed trying to get the pain under control. DO NOT DO THAT! One thing it did which wasnt too much of a big deal is it made me talk constantly. I couldnt shut up. I also felt like I had to keep moving always doing something. The insomnia is what was horrible. I couldnt sleep no matter how bad I wantes to and my body was screaming for the sleep. I know it sounds crazy but it was the second night that I realized it was the medicine causing it. I guess it took awhile to put it together because my mind was constantly thinking of something but couldnt focus on one thing. I never felt that bad physically before. About 6 hours after taking last dose I finally started to settle down and I crashed and slept for 14 hours. I had been taking it for about six months when I did this and havent done it since. Horrible experience. I dont see how people can possibly like that. It sucked. Other than that episode it does great for me. I can function and live my life. I dont get euphoric like some people describe_ which is perfectly fine with me. I dont like not feeling in control or not being able to focus on what Im doing. For me it feels no different than when taking an",M,43,2  days45 4X D,8/14/2014Email,Oxycodone hydrochloride
5, 5, Fibromyalgia_ Chronic Pain Syndrome,constipation,I take this for breakthrough pain_ usually 45 mg in the morning_ and 30 mg in the evening.   It is fast acting for me_ usually I can get pain relief in 30 minutes.   Fortunately I don't get high from it like many people do - they are the one's who are abusing this medicine_ making it more difficult to get_  especially for those that really have a need for it.   This year_ 2014_  it appears that the DEA is making it more difficult to obtain.   I've already ran into difficulty  filling prescriptions at 2 pharmacies where I've filled it in the past.   One said they were going to check with my doc_  but they didn't.   Another one said the same_ then said even so_ they could refuse to fill it - treating me like an addict.   So remember this when you fill your script.,M,58,7  years15 mg 5X D,6/27/2014,Oxycodone hydrochloride

8, 3, Spinal damage/torn discs_,They make me feel very dopey/drugged up. And_ yet_ they don't control my pain as well.vivid dreams. Loss of appetite and loss of energy (I'm VERY tired all the time),(A 214) - 15mg Oxycodone.Initial impressions:Basically_ they seem to be strong as hell. I tried taking half (they are scored). But_ I ended up having to take the other half_ since the pain was still there. It is fascinating how medications work. And_ how little differences create such different results. It's the same ingredient as a Percocet - Only without the Tylenol. Yet_ Percocets give me energy & make me feel slightly happy : )I always thought that (the infamous) Oxycontin was such an effective & powerful painkiller. I've since found out_ that it is simply a timed-release version of Oxycodone. In any case_ I never thought that I would be prescribed it. And_ nowI discover_ that for me: It definitely isn't as great as it's supposed to be. I have a new-found respect for my regular med (Opana IR - Oxymorphone).,M,42,3  days15 4X D,3/8/2012Email,Oxycodone hydrochloride
9, 4, severe chronic pain,Sleepiness_ overall feeling of being weighed down.,I love this medication! I have been suffering from severe chronic pelvic lower back pain due to pelvic congestion syndrome_ endometriosis_ and polycystic ovary syndrome since I was 19 years old. I only have one ovary left having lost the other to a 6 inch cyst. I also have scar tissue from a diagnostic laperoscopy_ emergency laparotomy_ and c-section. This drug finally gave me my life back. I can sit in a car without holding my abdomen. I can play with my 3 month old daughter_ I can go for short walks around the neighborhood_ and I have regained intimacy with my fiance'. This drug has drastically improved my quality of life!,F,22,2  months15 mg 4X D,12/15/2010Email,Oxycodone hydrochloride
