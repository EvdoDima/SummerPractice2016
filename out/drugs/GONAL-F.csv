0, 5, IVF,bloating and fullness,WOW! I stimmed for 11 days and at 38 yrs old produced 27 eggs! Got 4_ 6 day blasts_ transferred 2 and put 2 in cryo. Lost the first 2_ thawed the other 2 and now have perfectly heathy 7 yr old twin boys. Do yourself a favor_ use Antagon for downreg b4 transfer. Lupron is horrid.,F,45,11  days,2/19/2008Email,Gonal-f

2, 3, IVF,nothing at first_then growing pressure from follicles_day 7 suddenly vomiting_ belching_burning sensation of skin. Nurse said it is normal reaction to estrogen. Doctors overstimulated me as I went from 95 to 11_000 on my estrogen count within 9 days (max should be 4_000-7_000).  Estrogen will peak in in further 7 days but no tests to be done to know.  I have 9 + 6 follicles to be retrieved so their interest in my sky-high estrogen level and its side-effects is over. It did what it was suppose to do stimulated ovaries to pop follicles.,I am worried about long term effect_ as estrogen exposure is linked with breast cancer.  Of course I found it out towards end of IVF as I started to vomit and took interest in holistic medicine oppionion.,F,38,10  days,4/1/2006,Gonal-f
