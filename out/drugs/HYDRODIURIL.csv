0, 1, elevated BP,"A. overall ""creakiness"" in all joints - seems to ""hop"" around: some days it's my left knee_ then my right knee_ then my right ankle_ hip joints_ shoulder joints. One day I have to use a cane_ the next day it miraculously disappears!   B. total loss of libido.  C. sadness_ loss of interest. D. heart palpitations. E. sleeplessness_ then drowsiness during the day.  F. weight gain",I am SO extremely upset right now! I stumbled onto this website while trying to find out whether my horrendous heartburn last night was due to taking my daily meds  right before bedtime. Imagine my shock when reading these things about HCTZ! I've been through testing for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus about this joint pain! All were negative. I'd just resolved myself to sitting here doing nothing_ not feel like doing anything_ in too much pain to do anything_ like I have the body of a 90 year old!   VERY disappointed my Dr. never suggested the possible connection between my subjective complaints and my use of HCTZ!!!   I am going to self-taper myself off this drug immediately!   I'll control my BP issues the right way: diet and exercise (of course_ I'll probably actually  feel like exercising after I'm off this drug) !,F,60,8  years25 mg 1X D,12/20/2014Email,Hydrodiuril
1, 1, high blood pressure,muscle pain_ weaknessmessed up electrolyltescritically low sodium and chloride,doctor put allergic to this drug and said I was never to take it or any drug containing hctz againElectrolyes were in critical condition,F,71,6  months25mg 1X D,8/24/2012,Hydrodiuril
2, 2, HI Blood Pressure,TRY SILDENAFIL I DID & IT WORKS!!! I NOW TAKE 50MG 3X'S/DAY STARTED W/ 25MG 2X'S. STILL REQUIRE DIOVAN 120-160MG/DAY & NORVASC 5MG_ BUT OFF HCT. INITIALLY IT HELPED ALTHOUGH IT CAUSED PALPITATIONS.  THEN ADDED NORVASC 5MG AND IT STOPPED PALPITATIONS.  ALSO TRY INCREASING POTASSIUM INTAKE ie..2000 - 3000MG /DAY & KEEP SODIUM UNDER 1000MG.  THESE DO WORK.  DRINKING DISTILLED WATER HELPS TOO.  FOR THOSE WITH MILD HBP DR. WHITAKER HAS AN HERBAL FORMULA CALLED BP ESSENTIALS.  I TRIED IT_ IT WORKS BUT NOT ENOUGH FOR MY CONDITION.,Once the palpitations ended I had about 2 weeks of feeling pretty good_ which I have not had in a long time.  Then I began to get worse by the week.  Then I got worse by the day.  Went to a different Dr. he did Basic Metabolic Panel- Glucose & Electrolytes.  In only 2 months HCT had lowered sodium & chloride too much & increased Glucose which is why I began having scabs form for no reason & did not go away till 2 weeks after quitting HCT.  I got weaker & weaker & every muscle & joint in my body hurt way more than Diovan alone.  Could hardly sleep more than a couple hrs @ a time but always exhausted.  I would try lying down to sleep but no luck.  When I did actually sleep I had very agitating dreams.  Not sure I was awake or asleep @ times.  The last month I had increasingly severe headaches.  Before long I was taking 4-6 Tylonals / day just to exist.  I normally seldom ever need that.  Definitely signs of Lupus.  RBC_ Hemo-G & platelets R dropping.Now about 2 weeks off HCT Headaches have gone_ pain has decreased but not gone_ energy has come back some.  I would not recomend this to anyone.  Sildenafil is the best thing I've found yet & it does more than lower BP.  If U know what I mean. I AM STARTING A GROUP CALLED CITIZENS AGAINST PHARMACEUTICAL TORTURE - CAPT.  Contact me if U want to help.  I want to change the way Dr.s just throw meds at people w/o even diagnosing them. ,M,44,2  months,7/15/2009Email,Hydrodiuril
3, 3, Mildly elevated blood pressure,"It worked very well in controlling my BP. I'm a classic ""White Coat"" person -- always reads high in the doctor's office but was generally 120/80 or below at home. However_ after 2 years_ I had a fasting glucose reading of 129. My A1C readings were in normal (5.5) range. After reading a lot of stories about HCTz raising blood sugar_ I convinced my doctor to take me off this. The next fasting glucose was 105. Coincidence?",,M,53,2.5  years,1/13/2009,Hydrodiuril
4, 1, hypertension,medicine-induced lupus,Even though there is a low risk for drug-induced lupus_ I wouldn't recommend this drug to anyone -- if you have an autoimmune disorder (such as fibromyalgia_ or even think you may possibly have one -- please do not take this drug.  They say the lupus usually goes away within days of quitting the drug_ but it has been months for me -- and I was not even taking the HCTZ for more than a few months.,F,50,4  months,2/3/2008,Hydrodiuril
5, 1, High Blood Pressure,Had taken HCTZ for about 2  1/2 years with little or no problems.  In the last six months_ however_ I started having dizziness/dizzy spells and feeling light headed.  About 2 months ago_ started experiencing ED_ which I have never experienced before.  Could not get or maintain an erection.  Lost my libido as well.  I started researching possible causes_ and discussed with my doctor HCTZ.  Stopped taking it and switched it an ACE inhibitor.  Dizziness went away within 2 days.  Within 1 week_ my ED problem started to disappear; within 2 weeks_ my libido almost completely came back and is now virtually back to normal (after 3 weeks).  Not having any ED issues at all anymore.  Although I'm 40 years old_ I am fit and in shape_ eat right_ and have a good mental attitude.  All of these factors did not mean anything when on HCTZ_ although no problems showed up within the first 2 years of taking this drug.,Would like EVERY male who takes HCTZ to know that the potential sexual side effect of this drug IS REAL!  Due to this side effect problem_ it caused problems with my girlfriend who thought I wasn't attracted to her anymore; I thought I was going crazy since my libido dropped to nothing and I couldn't get or sustain an erection.  All males should BEWARE!!!,M,40,2  years,10/24/2007,Hydrodiuril
6, 3, HBP,Slight dizziness and the too often feeling like I have to GO!,It seems to bring down the BP when added to an ACE to get it toa normal reading.,M,50,30  days,4/10/2007,Hydrodiuril
7, 2, hypertension,impotence,kicked my BP down great_ but not worth the trade-off. I wonder how many people are on this AND Viagra.,M,41,6  months,6/3/2006,Hydrodiuril
8, 4, Hypertension,Blood pressure is now at 120/70! It was at 180/90!!! I can still do sports a lot. Marathon_ Mountain biking.... But I have now problemes with impotence. The erections are weak. It takes very very long to orgasm.,,M,36,11  months,11/12/2005,Hydrodiuril
9, 2, HBP (150/90),Complete loss of sexual function,Worked extremely well at controlling high BP.  Took 10 mg in combination with 10 mg Altace each day.  The Altace didn't do much by itself_ so the HCTZ was added.  Within 2 days of starting the HCTZ my BP had dropped to 115/70.  The sexual side effects_ however_ were not worth it.  Discontinued HCTZ after 3 weeks and switched to Norvasc.,M,41,3  weeks,6/7/2005,Hydrodiuril
10, 1, hypertension,makes you lethargic_ there is weight gain as your body retains more water_ it flushes essential minerals from your body leading to muscle cramps and joint problems_ disturbs your sleep and also leads to erectile dysfunction.this diuretic means disaster for your health,,M,58,18  months,1/19/2005,Hydrodiuril
