0, 2, Menopause,Dizziness_ anxiety_ fatigue_ difficulty concentrating_ ocular migraines.,"I wrote the review posted on 7/29/14 and am updating.  The wonderful results I had using this med didn't last.  Over the past year and a half I've experienced dizziness daily_ anxiety to the point of becoming a hermit_ extreme difficulty concentrating and noticed one day I couldn't even write my name when signing  at the grocery store checkout.  I have since tried progesterone cream and figured out it wasn't the (very low dose) of estrogen in Femhrt that was making me sick it was progestins.  Progesterone cream also causes these side effects for me.  Femhrt is largely composed of progestin and a low dose of estrogen. Contrary to all of the ""estrogen dominance"" literature out there some of us can't handle progestins.  Read the reviews for progesterone on this site for other perspectives.",F,53,3  years1mg/5mcg 1X D,6/20/2016,Femhrt
1, 5, Menopause,,"I am taking a generic version of Femhrt called Jinteli. I had been on BCP since I was in my early twenties. Five years ago I stopped taking the pill and immediately was postmenopausal. The first year I experienced hot flashes. Every year after I experienced worsening symptoms including: low blood sugar levels_ heart palpitations_ anxiety_ insomnia (for one year sleeping only four hours per night)_ body aches and pains_ I felt I had aged 15 years in four years_ and poor memory which to me felt like dementia. After reading about the WHI study I was too afraid to try HRT. Instead I tried acupuncture_ meditation_ herbs_ saw a naturopath. I saw MD's and found out how easy it is to get a prescription for antidepressants/anti-anxiety meds (which I never tried). I kept asking older women how they survived menopause and so many told me they had used Prempro or Premarin. Finally a year ago I asked my OB/GYN for a prescription for HRT. It took about six months to feel ""normal"" again_ but the results have been only a blessing. Most nights I now sleep 8 hours_ my memory is back_ and there are no more aches and pains. I would have rated my health a 2 or 3 a year ago and now would say it is an 8 or 9. If taking this shortens my lifespan so be it. I'd rather have a few really good years than live to be a hundred feeling the way I had been feeling.",F,51,1  years1 mg/5 mcg 1X D,7/29/2014EmailHistory,Femhrt
