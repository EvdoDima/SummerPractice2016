1, 5, MDD_ Anxiety_ Agorophobia_ have chi,Nausea,First antidepressant inmy life that actually WORKS!! I WANT TO GET UP_ DO THINGS.No jitters. Work through the nausea- eat a few peanut butter crackers or saltines_ then take pill_then sit UP. Will only last for a little while. Set aside time to be still. If you lay down right away you will vomit. If you take at bedtime_ once the nausea calms down_lady on or tilt toward your left side especially if you have GERD issues. At 5mg you may see minimal effects. Once you start to increase toward 10mg you should start feeling better. Please get Zofran for the nausea from your doctor if you need it. It keeps you from vomiting.I almost quit in the beginning due to it but I found that the crackers and only a few shops of water worked. Always check all medication interactions with amedication interaction checker online_especially if you use multiple pharmacies. Hang in there. This medication is a miracle for me. Taper up slowly per month if you need to.,F,36,3  months10 mg,8/12/2016Email,Brintellix

3, 4, depression and anxiety,I have felt great on this medication.  My weight has remained constant and my bowel movements are regular.  Some nights_ I still have problems sleeping_ and nap during the day  I think I will try to take the medication at night.  I have had some serious loss of equilibrium (not vertigo)_ and I have fallen down 4 times.To date_ these episodes have not been associated with the brintellix by my psychiatrist or specialists I have seen for the problem.  I have even had an MRI and MRA_ and now how an appointment with a neurologist.  I am starting to think that the brinitellix may be associated with the loss of equilibrium.  I intent to discuss with my psychiatrist again.  But I would hate to stop taking this drug_ as it has really helped by depression.  I have more desire to engage in life_ and I am much more social.,,,62,1  years10 mg 1X D,8/1/2016Email,Brintellix

22, 4, PTSD_ MDD_ PANIC ATTACKS_ GAD,I tried this med last year but due to extreme constipation switched. Back on it now because other than constipation it's the best I have ever tried. Since I was on 40mg Prozac 2 weeks ago and could not wean before starting brintellix I am only on 5mg right now. Prozac can take several weeks to leave the body and increase brintellix effects by 2 times. When I try to increase my dosage right now I have symptoms of serotonin syndrome for about 1 hour (heart racing_ sweating_ shaking_ shivering_ anxiety_ nausea)_ so I am waiting another week to increase to maybe 7.5. Cutting the pills is difficult (shape)_ but it can be done. First few days I experienced a metal taste in my mouth_ feeling of warmness_ and a little bit of jitters about 1 hour after taking it. Only lasted 5 to 10 minutes. Now  I have night sweats_ feel little motivation_ and sleepy_ but it has helped with my anxiety a lot. Anxiety feels physical so I don't freak out. Last time I was on 10mg I felt pretty good all around. Feel more logical and in charge of my life_ less emotional and out of control. I'm expecting to feel better as I will slowly increase to 10mg over the next few weeks. Do not recommend transitioning from Prozac because of long half life and increase of brintellix plasma makes transitioning extremely difficult.,Other side effects right now are sometimes upset stomach_ soft stools_ little moodiness.,F,46,2  weeks5mg,6/3/2016Email,Brintellix

27, 2, Depression,Strange neurological symptoms,I had heard great things about Brintellix so I was excited to try it and was extremely disappointed when I had an adverse reaction. My face went numb_ lips tingly_ I was slurring my words_ and my whole body was twitching. It was some kind of strange migraine/seizure-like neurological thing so I had to stop taking the med. Luckily none of the bad effects lingered after the Brintellix was out of my system.,F,22,3  days5 mg,5/17/2016,Brintellix
28, 5, Depression/Anxiety/Toxicomania,Visual hallucinations_ nausea_ morning insomnia (wake up at 5 am but refreshed)_ dizziness_ irritability. Side effects are mild and subsides after 1 week. Better tolerance_ than with tricyclics and SSRIs/SSNRIs.,Brintellix is a serotonin modulator and stimulator that has a different mode of action and also stimulates norepinephrine and acétylcholine release in the brain. I was a methamphetamine drug addict_ and I tried all the antidepressants available including tricyclics. Anafranil was excellent but I had some annoying side effects. Since I take Brintellix_ the brain fog disappeared and I have more energy_ more motivation_ a better quality of life and I don't suffer from social anxiety anymore. My quality of sleep is better. I didn't gain any weight. I have a more concentration and it helps my ADHD. I use in combination with Vyvanse 40 mg_ Lamictal 100 mg and Wellbutrin SR 100 mg BID.

31, 3, Major Depressive Disorder,First couple of days on this medication I was knocked on my butt.  Very fuzzy_ tired and dizzy.  I definitely experience nausea on this medication but nothing I cannot handle by now.  If I do not eat with it_ that's when I experience most of the nausea.  Also_ if I do not eat with it I will experience diarrhea.I have a great doc who put me on the brat diet until the symptoms were tolerable.  Organic apple juice_ toast_ rice_ crackers and light chicken soups.  Other than that_ I have not had anything bothersome other than insomnia which I take benedryl to help relieve.,I'm very sensitive when it comes to medication.  So instead of switching me_ my doctor helped me work my way through the  side effects.  10 mg pulled me out of a depressed fog.  I suspect I'll end up on 20 mg for full relief.  No high blood pressure_ no weight gain_ no food cravings....it's worth a shot if you can get through the first few weeks.,F,36,3  weeks10 mg,5/11/2016,Brintellix
32, 5, Major Depressive Disorder,Decreased sex drive (as with all antidepressants I've taken),Brintellix cured me of MDD. I have been on antidepressants for 7 years and this is the only medication that helped me. I was on Celexa_ Zoloft_ and Effexor before I took this and the previous medications all failed.

37, 3, Major Depressive Disorder,Dizziness_ headache_ gas,I am switching to Brintellix from Paxil as the Paxil has seemed to run its course in helping my depression.  Doctor said she's seen good things with this med and thinks it will be good for me.  The first couple of days were fine.  Yesterday and today I have alot of dizziness and headaches.  When I move my head_ it feels like my brain has to physically catch up.  Have to work hard to absorb information or listen right now.  We stopped the Paxil cold turkey and started with the 10 mg of this hoping that would ease some of the withdrawal symptoms.  Not sure if this weird thing I'm having is withdrawal from the old med or side effect of this new one.  I knew Paxil is hard to withdrawal from_ but I'm going to hang in there with this one and hopefully this feeling gets better.  Super gassy-I know that's the Brintellix.  No itching yet.  Lots of racing thoughts_ but that's my norm anyways.  Slept fine last night_ but took 1/2 an Ambien before bed.,F,46,4  days10 MG 1X D,3/28/2016Email,Brintellix

As soon as I started the 10mg dose I was able to feel an improvement in my thought processes.  Prior to Brintellix_ I had been constantly obsessing with anxiety and depressed_ feeling hopeless and that I was just hear to wait until death took me.  A week after the 10 mg/day dose_ I was able to think about my day and things that I needed to do.  No more obsessing.

43, 4, Major Depression_PTSD_ anxiety,So far I have only experienced little red spots appearing all over my skin. I have had a bit of insomnia but then again I always do. My anxiety is a bit higher but not unbearable. I am concerned about the red spots because this is what happened to me when I took Paxil. It turned into extreme itching after the spots appeared.,I haven't had any of the nausea that people complain about so far. I have taken it on an empty stomach and with food. The amazing thing about it so far is that it has already stopped my constant thoughts of suicide. I haven't been crying all the time or had mood swings. I am concerned about the people who said that they gained weight with this drug. I know it is supposed to be weight neutral. I am already over-weight from taking in the past Depakote_ Zyprexa_ Remeron and other drugs that make you gain weight. Right now I am only taking Brintellix_ Xanax and Trazadone. I just read that someone said it wasn't good to take Trazadone and Brintellix together.  I am supposed to stay on the dose I'm on for 2 weeks and then bump it up to 10mg. If the spots turn into itching I will have to discontinue this drug I guess. I also read about the short term memory loss. That worries me as I already have that from taking various different Benzos for years. I know what they do to my memory.,F,54,4  days5 mg. 1X D,2/18/2016,Brintellix

However_ I did stop crying daily_ but was probably just too numbed out. I didn't actually feel any better_ had no energy_ and just sat on the couch all the time. I did have nausea daily but I have a pretty iron stomach so no vomiting. After nearly two months_ I gave up on the med. Within 2 weeks of stopping_ I gained 7 lbs.

Until the last 3 months I've experienced severe depression which may be due to becoming perimenopausal but regardless my doctor switched me from 60mg Cymbalta to 10mg of Brintellix without tapering. Felt manic_ had great energy but agitation_ anxiety and intense irritability within 2 days. In short_ I felt terrible. Doctor changed me back to cymbalta at 120mg which I've been on for exactly a month now but I'm in severe depression still. Started birth control to see if hormones will help and looking into a Novasure procedure to see if that makes a difference. I've was diagnosed with depression 30 years ago and have taken Effexor_ Zoloft_ Wellbutrin_ Serzone_ abilify_ at multiple long-term periods in my life.

52, 1, Depression_ anxiety,Started at 5mg and had mild nausea and sleeplessness but did experience some improvement in depressive symptoms and anxiety. Even noticed improved cognitive functioning and concentration. But that all changed after 2 weeks when massive even worse anxiety and depression ensued. Became completely obsessive about every little thing and brain was racing with random negative thoughts. Would awake every night after 4 hours sleep with mind racing so badly sleep was impossible. Developed a severe pressure headache and fogged out disassociated feeling as well as noticeable problems with memory recall and even slurred speech. Went straight to Dr after finishing 1 month supply of pills and was told to stop immediately and was placed on Prozac which produced immediate improvements.,Obviously this drug works for some but not for others -- everyone has different body chemistry and genetic make-up -- but for me this drug_ after early promise_ proved to be a 2 week psychotic roller coaster ride that made me far worse mentally. Hope and perseverance are not reliable methods to address severe symptoms. If it's not working for you talk to your doctor fast. There are other options.,M,53,1  months5mg,12/31/2015,Brintellix

I've been on over 40 different psych drugs in hopes of reducing my depression. This is the ONLY drug I've taken that didn't give me sexual side effects_ or any other bad reaction. Within two week I started noticing a slights change for the better and now after a month in feeling amazing even at the lowest dose. Give it some time and realize the therapeutic dose is ideally 15-20mg a day. So_ if you don't notice much in the beginning its because you're probably not on the right dose for you. I HIGHLY recommend this med. It even helps me focus.,M,24,1  months5mg,12/26/2015,Brintellix

58, 3, Depression resistance to other trea,It seems to help with my depression but also seems to be aggravating anxiety and trouble sleeping.  Nausea is terrible but lessening with time.  It is better if taken with food.  Although it seems to make me extremely tired feeling_ when I lay down to sleep_ my mind is racing and I can't sleep.  Only sleep short amounts even with xanax.  I have been on xanax/kloni for years.  Have never had trouble sleeping with the xanax before.   I am going to try changing up the time that I take it and see if that helps.  I am also going to try to continue it and see if the sleep/anxiety thing is maybe another side effect that may reside with time.,,F,35,1  months5-10,12/9/2015Email,Brintellix

I will be suggesting to stop the medication because I feel worse after taking this medication. But my psychiatrist has been less than helpful_ she keeps threatening to drop me as a patient. She says none of her other patients complain about these symptoms. I also have had numbness in one hand since taking this med. She says it is not medication related_ but I'm concerned about permanent nerve damage. This psychiatrist has no compassion and is in the wrong business.

Usually during the fall and winter months I would be severely depressed_ not leaving my house and many times not even leaving the bed for days at a time but since starting Brintellix that has greatly changed. In the summer of 2015 I started having panic attacks 1-2 days a week which I was told was due to my body getting use to the dose I was on.

80, 2, Major depression_ General Anxiety,"This is an update of my initial review from July 2015. I had only been on the med a week at that point. I first found this to be very promising. Side effects were manageable and I had a very brief period of clarity and motivation which led my doc and I to decide to bump up to 10mg. Well_ I'm not sure how that went because I was asleep 90% of the time. I could not stay awake. Generally_ I have issues with insomnia. This was like 2 or 3 naps per day and sleeping through the night and into the afternoon. No good. Back to 5mg. I haven't noticed any more ""up"" days but what I've finally realized is the ridiculous amount of sweating that I've been concerned about_ complaining about_ disgusted about_ is more than likely from this med. It has become such an embarrassing problem that my anxiety is increased. I literally am dripping sweat from my hairline and back and the rest of my skin is clammy. It's unbearable now. I thought I'd see if it would subside like some of the other side ef",I've been on many SSRIs and SNRIs and have never experienced the excessive (REALLY excessive) sweating as with this medication. It has been mortifying and uncomfortable and there is no way that I can continue like this. I wasn't seeing much_ if any_ improvement anyway_ so I'll be glad to get rid of this one.,F,41,2  months5 MG 1X D,9/10/2015Email,Brintellix

So I went two days without anything and tried again_ first night I was fine and then tonight I threw up again. Not sure if food is making it worse or not but my dr said to take it at night_ which I have been. I can't tell a difference yet with the medicine. I've only been focused on the nausea and vomiting.

105, 4, Depression,Nausea the first 2 weeks_ zero sex drive_ no weight gain_ but trouble losing weight despite intense exercise regimen and clean eating/calorie restriction,I was experiencing intense depression due to coming off of an addiction to prescription pain medicine. I had no energy_ was binge eating_ couldn't get off the couch_ extreme apathy for life and just couldn't experience any joy no matter what the occasion. Within 2 weeks of starting the Brintellix I was a completely different person.  I could live again. I started with 5 mg for 2 weeks and then went up to 10 mg. After 3 months I started feeling apathetic again and wanted to live on the couch. Upped it to 20 mg and also started an exercising daily and started a big weight loss program to lose the weight I gained in the winter. Despite everything I've done to lose weight_ I'm not losing any. My blood work came back normal and I've never had trouble losing weight so I'm assuming the Brintellix is to blame.  I also have absolutely NO sex drive and I feel sorry for my husband. I don't even want him to touch me. I've always had a high libido so this is definitely a negative. I never planned to stay on Brintellix long term and I feel like it was what I needed to get me out of my original depression. Now that I've started exercising daily_ eating healthy and taking supplements_ I feel like it's time to start weening off so that I can have my sex drive back and lose weight.

I just saw my doctor today and made the switch back to zoloft. I will add that the brintellix did help with depression but I never felt like myself on it.,,F,28,6  months10mg,5/2/2015Email,Brintellix

The same day I cold turkey stopped the Brintellix_ I haven't vomited since,I am very sad and disappointed i had to stop the Brintellix because I have tried very single depression med out there and this was the only one that worked with minimal side effects and added bonus of increased sex drive.

There's some light tremors_ or shakiness in my hands. I've been kind of spaced out. Driving is not going smoothly_ I'm a danger out there_ no ability to judge distance & im easily distracted.

128, 2, depression and anxiety,Intense itching for first two weeks_ which subsided_ but returned after about 7 months. My face and scalp itched so intensely I literally scratched the blood out of my skin.  AND my hair began to fall out in large clumps.  Took about six weeks after stopping Brintellix for the itching and hair loss to stop. I would NEVER take this drug.  Benadryl did nothing for the itching.,Worked great for both depression and anxiety_ I felt so much better that I tried desperately to continue taking it in spite of the itching_ but could not bear for all my hair to fall out too! Side effects were worse than the MDD and anxiety.,F,59,8  months20mg 1X D,3/9/2015,Brintellix

I have had a sleepy _calm feeling. I think that this is what this medicine is suppose to do to help relax and wire me down. I am able to fall asleep without over thinking so much or even thinking random_ ongoing thoughts.I have had a little bit of itching in different places_but nothing that is unbearable. I have noticed yesterday that when I wanted to cry_it was hard to . I would get a little sad_ but I couldn't just bust in tears like usual_or even shed tears. I have also had small headaches here and there_but again_nothing unbearable. My mood I feel is a bit better. I'm a little brighter and more calm_ but I also feel that I haven't been on it long enough to feel the full affect.

132, 2, bipolar manic depression_ anxiety,Extreme dizziness_ nausea_ muscle weakness_ back of neck stiff and tight_ pain behind eyes_ non stop diarrhea_ made acid reflux worse_ made anxiety worse,I am a veteran when it comes to psychiatric medications. Due to poor care over the years_ I've become med resistant which is scary and overwhelming. Please remember that everyone responds to these medications different. Also keep in mind when you are doing research that these medications take at least 30+ days to get in your system. I tried to battle out the side effects and today made the decision that the bad outweighs the good. The dizziness and muscle fatigue was terrible for me. The nausea was getting better and I found that taking it at night helped. I noticed that it killed my sex drive but oddly I had some of the best orgasams. Weird! I also felt like this med was trying to work but would fade followed by extreme anxiety. I also take depakote_ adderall_ ativan and saphris to sleep. After 2 months and still scary low_ I'm considering going off. My Dr bumped me up to 10 mg yesterday but I'm finding it hard to come up with the fight to continue a med that causes me so many side effects.

The headaches at 5 mg subsided after going up to 10 mg.  I've had very brief instances of feeling better_ but they fade quickly.  From what I was told by my pdoc this is a medicine that will either work for you_ work for a few weeks then stop_ or you'll never experience any benefit from it.  I had hoped that the SRI and 5-HT1A agonist effects would help my GAD/panic attacks_ but I've only experienced increased anxiety at 10 mg so far.,M,34,2  weeks10 1X D,2/24/2015,Brintellix

141, 5, major depression_ suicidal thoughts,I was having nausea at first but my doctor told me to take it after dinner/before bed and that cured it. He told me I would feel better after taking it for 2 weeks_ good after 4 weeks_ and WONDERFUL at 6 weeks. I wanted him to write that statement down because I was so depressed and doubtful anything could get me out of the pit. Well_ at 8 weeks I was a completely different person. I have energy_ I am not prone to the ups and downs_ I am finally getting my life back. I've tried many other anti-depressants (Zoloft_ Effexor_ Cymbalta_ and a few others over the past 15 years) and Brintellix quite simply saved my life. My only issue is with my PMS induced rage_ which this med doesn't seem to cure. My doctor just started me on 10mg of Prozac so we'll see if that helps. I also take Lamictal for BPD_ Adderrall_ Wellbutrin_ Phosphatidyl-Serine_ and n-acetylcysteine. Thank you_ Brintellix...

And_ also recently_ some itching in my arms that wasn't there before.,On the positive side_ Brintellix was more effective for my GAD and depression than Viibryd (similar mechanism of action).  I'd give Brintellix a 3.5/10 and Viibryd a 0.5/10.  Brintellix gives me a mild anti-anxiety_ antidepressant effect.  But it is not robust.  I still feel anxious_ paranoid_ and codependent.  I lack the ability to interact fully with others_ and to feel good about myself.  I still feel very disabled.

This is by far the best AD I've taken in my 5+ years of trying to find a medication. I've tried almost every AD on the market (SSRI's/SNRI's/TCA's/MAOI's/Antipsychotics). The pros definitely outweigh the cons for me. Also_ when I started taking 20MG of this medication I started loosing weight (20+ lbs so far). The only downside to this medication is that it's brand new and the co-pay is pretty high_ but I usually get samples at my psychiatrist's office and there is always the option of payment assistance from the pharmaceutical company.,M,22,3  months20MG 1X D,8/2/2014Email,Brintellix

After the first week_ the only side effect I had was heartburn/indigestion.  It was very tolerable.  Unfortunately_ it didn't help my anxiety and OCD at all.  I was actually worse after 6 weeks.  I did not try to increase the dose because I didn't want the heartburn to get worse.

Also I quit smoking 7 years ago but I am now getting intense cravings for cigarettes and started smoking 1 1/2 cigarettes each day for the past 3 days. Going to tell Psych I want off as I can't take the itching and I don't need to get addicted to cigarettes again.,,M,45,10  days10mg,4/29/2014,Brintellix
175, 2, depression/anxiety,Intially I had mild nausea for the first few days.  About day 7 I became more depressed and had more anxiety.  I tried to stick it out because the literature said some people felt better at 2 weeks. At 10 days I was feeling awful; heavy feeling and just being very down and tired.  I decided it was too much for me_ especially if I had to take it for 4-6 weeks before noticing an improvement. I calleld my Doc and got off this med.  I feel much better but still trying to find what works for me.,,M,68,10  days10mg 1X D,4/15/2014,Brintellix
176, 2, Major depression,None,I had been taking Cymbalta 60mg for  5 years.  It worked great at first but over the past 6 months I was losing my concentration and motivation.  My doctor recommended switching to Brintellix.  He said it was one of the best drugs available.  I started at 10 mg and jumped to 2 0 after 2 weeks.  I tapered off Cymbalta during  this.  During my 5th week I was completely off cymbalta.  I started going into a tailspin with crying spells and massive anxiety.  I ended going back to Cymbalta and within 15 hours of taking it felt miraculously better. Sadly_  Brintellix did nothing for me.  No side effect_ no nothing.  I quit right away.  Very expensive.,M,40,2  months20 1X D,3/27/2014,Brintellix
177, 2, Anxiety,I'm on this for anxiety but seem to be more anxious.  I also have the feeling of a lump in my throat and small light-weight pieces of food getting stuck to the inside of my throat.  I feel the need to swallow a LOT at night and that causes me more anxiety.  Neck muscles feel tight.,I started out on 10mg once a day a couple months ago.  Last week the doctor increased my dosage to 20mg once per day.  So far no change.,F,42,2  months10_20mg 1X D,3/26/2014Email,Brintellix
178, 5, MDD,I think I am experiencing mild gas. But NO nausea which is great because that seems to be the most common side effect.,I feel very clear. I was taking Zoloft for about 7 months and was a zombie. I wasn't sad. I wasn't ANYTHING. I was still depressed ie; lacking motivation_ no joy in my life. I think I've found an anti-depressant that WORKS!,F,49,4  days10mg 1X D,3/24/2014Email,Brintellix
