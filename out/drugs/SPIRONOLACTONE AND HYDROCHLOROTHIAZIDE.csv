0, 4, cystic acne,Got a itchy rash which spread to various parts of my body. Started to have abnormal sleep patterns where I would stay awake all night or not be able to sleep until 2am or later. I took Benadryl and a sedative to get some sleep. I was willing to deal with the rash until it spread more and more.,My skin  became drier_ and clearer but wrinkly and not a healthy skin tone. The cysts became smaller and at the end before I had to stop the treatment - my skin was the best it had been in months. About a month before I broke out after many years of no lumps I was put on Prednisone for 1 week 10mgs a day. I will always wonder if this was the cause.,F,64,3  weeks50mg 2X D,2/12/2012Email,Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide
