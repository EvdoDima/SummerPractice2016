1, 1, Prevent pregnancy_ PCOS,Decreased libido_ vaginal dryness_ constant hunger_ bloating_ slight breakouts. This medicine has worked to prevent pregnancy because I no longer want to have sex with my husband_ which probably shouldn't be normal for someone my age. The vaginal dryness is what makes sex so unemployable for me.,,F,23,1  years1 X D,4/13/2016,Desogen
2, 1, Pre-IVF cycle,Pulmonary embolism_ DVT in right leg.  I was taking Reclipsen specifically.,This drug has ruined my current chances of getting pregnant and changed my life.  It's dangerous and should not be on the market any longer.,F,38,4  months.15 mg 1X D,2/25/2016Email,Desogen
3, 5, birth control & another condition,Very few side effects- I do not go off this pill I am on the active form at all times as it not only provides birth control_ it helps decrease the number of shots I need for another medical condition... it has been excellent!!!!,This medication has substantially improved my life over the past decade,F,51,10  years20mg 1X D,1/3/2016,Desogen
4, 2, Severe cramps from Endometriosis,I noticed I eat A LOT! Ill be full_ then 20 minutes later I'm hungry again! Over and over_ but mainly late at night. Its crazy! I mean_ I take adderall for my ADHD as well so I don't care about weight gain THAT much. I don't notice that big of a change in my mood. If I watch something sad that usually wouldn't even make me tear up_ I cry! Its not a major problem_ just noticeable!,I was prescribed a different BC originally_ but because I don't have insurance I couldn't afford it. I get debilitating cramps when I ovulate and the first few days of my period. Ive only been on it a few weeks but its ovulation time and BOOM_ cramps. They aren't as severe but they are still bad. Hopefully by the time I get my period it'll be in my blood more; so it stops these cramps!,F,30,2  weeks.15/.03 1X D,11/28/2015Email,Desogen

6, 3, birth control_ very painful periods,I was on birth control since I was 15_ to treat my very painful periods. With 37 I moved to the US from Germany_ and after my backup was used up_ I was prescribed Apri. They said it would be similar to my previous German b/c. It took care of my menstrual pains_ but I gained some weight. Especially my sex drive became zero. ZERO. I'm 41 now and stopped taking Apri_ hoping my body will balance my hormones. After 1 month off_ I'm having quite some hot flashes.,,F,41,3  years 1X D,9/9/2015,Desogen
7, 1, Regulate periods,Horriblen headaches and late coming on period even after I started the white pill. I started the white pills on a Thursday. I spotted on Sunday and got my period on Monday and had heavy bleeding horrible cramps_ took Tylenol_ took midol nothing worked until I took Motrin and at that it felt so bad Motrin barely worked. I could still feel it a little bit. Horrible cramps I ever experienced. I called my doctor he told me I could start the new pack of pills. I started the new pack Wednesday night and did not stop bleeding til I went to the hospital on Monday and they swicthed me from apri to balziva.,Although I'm on balziva now and I had now problems so far. I want to eventually go natural. Take a natural birth control_ I was doing my research and came across these two. I'm going to ask my doctor could she recommended one of these natural products. I just need something to regulate my cycles. I'm not worried about pregnancies.1)  Prohelp http://bhnformulas.com/prohelp-moisture-treatment-creme.html2) Natural Progesterone Creamhttps://drerika.com/store/product/natural-progesterone-cream,F,30,1  times.15mg,9/6/2015Email,Desogen
8, 2, To avoid ovarian cysts,BLOATING!!! Weight gain was noticed about 3wks into the prescription. Increased appetite leading to over eating. Constantly tired_ napping daily. Sore boobs and frequent headaches. Bring on the ovarian cysts_ I'd rather deal with them!,,F,29,2  months,7/13/2015Email,Desogen
9, 4, Endometriosis/cramps,bigger appetite_ bloating_ mild recurring nausea_ hot flashes_ emotional,I think it's making me hungry allll the time_ so I'm overeating and it's making me bloated and causing other digestional upsets. I'm just gonna try and cut back and not overeat. The nausea and the hot flashes aren't a big deal for me. The nausea is pretty rare and really mild and the hot flashes usually happen early in the morning/when i wake up. I've noticed I've been crying at the drop of a hat since I started. I've also had some irritability. However_ none of these symptoms are too bad--they're definitely not as severe as other birth controls I've been on. I haven't had my period yet_ I'm skipping it this month_ but I'll review once I have and weigh in on its effects on my cramps/endometriosis pain.,F,20,1  months 1X D,4/14/2015,Desogen
10, 5, Ovarian Cysts_ Regulate cycle_ PCOS,Weight loss_ slightly elevated blood pressure,I have tried several birth control pills and this one works great for me. I previously took Yaz before this and was a complete psychopath and emotional wreck. This pill has no emotional side effects for me. I did have some breakthrough bleeding during the first two months but that stopped and has been controlling my periods wonderfully since. I do have slightly elevated blood pressure since taking this_ but I'm not in the range of hypertension. I've gone from 115/75 readings to 125/83 (not too big of a deal). I lost 20 pounds when I started this pill but I have gained it back since then_ purely my own fault. I only break for a period every 3 months and I do have a little bit of a headache and dizziness during that time_ nothing too bad though.,F,26,2  years,3/22/2015Email,Desogen
11, 3, Contraception_ hormonal migraines,You'll all think I'm crazy that I'm giving a rating of 3 and not 1_ but Desigen kept me from getting pregnant (goal1) and allowed me to take the hormonal pills 3-4 months consecutively to help prevent the worsened headaches I would get during my period (goal 2) for many years.  HOWEVER-- Thank God I am typing this because I had a STROKE last month!  I am a 33 year old non-smoker with healthy eating habits; I weigh 115 lbs.  Please_ please- talk to your doctors about possible stroke risks if you are taking BCPs- especially if you also have migraines_ as this significantly increases your risk if you are on estrogen!!,StrokeDecreased sex drive,F,33,10  yearsOnce daily,2/18/2015Email,Desogen
12, 2, Lessen symptoms of a cyst,I was previously on generic Mircette and OBGYN wanted to increase my estrogen due to cyst pain.  I have only been on Apri (generic for Desogen) for a pack and a half_ but have felt decreased libido_ vaginal dryness_ depression/mood swings_ laziness and lethargy_ wanting to eat all the time_ at least 10 headaches with 2 that last more than 24 hours_ constant bloating with IBS symptoms of constant cramping and increased pooping_ increased GERD (which I already have)_ worse cramps during period.  It did clear up skin_ but that isn't worth it.  I'm normally an upbeat happy person_ but this is ruining my life.,Will be going off this pill and ALL oral contraceptives.  Going to try and regulate my hormones naturally with diet/exercise and deal with cyst symptoms on my own.  I'm tired of feeling crazy!,F,33,45  days 1X D,2/9/2015Email,Desogen
13, 4, Prevent pregnancy,Sore boobs_ cramps_itchy nipples,I'm writing because this site has so many bad reviews and in my case I really have no complaints about this BC. This is my first time ever going on BC and I was a bit nervous at first from the reviews. I have experienced sore breasts but that's because they have grown_quite quickly. I have minor cramps and nausea the first week but nothing bad. I take my pill at night after dinner which I heard decreases nausea and so far I've been fine. Every body will react differently so don't think all the bad reviews will be the same for you.,F,21,2  months 1X D,1/6/2015,Desogen

15, 2, Regulate periods,Weight gain_ IBS symptoms_ mood swings_ tired all the time.,"At first I thought these side effects were a result of being a freshman in college (""freshman 15"" was more like freshman 30) and stress_ etc. Now that I've been taking it for a year_ I'm becoming suspicious that it's behind my weight gain and constant bloating/digestive issues. I haven't changed my diet very much_ so there's no valid explanation as to why NONE of my pants fit anymore_ except for the birth control. I'll be ending this prescription next time I see my doctor.",F,19,1  years,11/16/2014,Desogen
16, 1, Pregnancy prevention,Severe cramps_ bad acne_ mood swings_ negative thoughts_ breast tenderness_ weight gain_ and always bloated,,F,32,2  months,10/27/2014,Desogen
17, 3, Break through bleeding,Great at first. Extremely heavy 3 to 4 day periods- bleeding through an ultra tampon in 2 hours_ painful breasts 2 weeks out of the month. I switched to an extended cycle pill due to low iron levels from blood loss.  I have read this pill can also affect your liver which I have been having issues. The only plus to desogen was the shorter period if you don't mind bleeding hard and fast.,,F,31,2  years,9/29/2014,Desogen
18, 3, Prevent pregnancy,ZERO sex drive_ moodiness_ irritability,I took Desogen for 6 years. I've recently stopped and immediately noticed a difference. I had absolutely NO sex drive and now it's back!! I'm less moody & feel  better overall. I would not recommend this pill.,F,32,6  years 1X D,8/30/2014,Desogen
19, 1, contraceptive,extreme cramps_ hair thinning_ severe mood swings_ loss of appetite for no reason_ and major loss of sex drive_ shortness of breath for no reason_ extra and chunky discharge_ breast tenderness back pain.,I was on Ortho-Cyclen for a year which is essentially the same thing before I started Desogen and had all the same problems. A lot of my symptoms can also be STD related but I was thoroughly checked multiple times before deciding it was the pill and you should make sure you get checked too. Some of the symptoms aren't even known by most OB/GYNs such as the extra and chunky discharge_ the shortness of breath and loss of appetite for no reason (this is common for the first month or two but it has continued for me.) The only thing good about this pill is that I didn't get pregnant. So glad to be off and feeling much better.,F,20,1  years 1X D,5/23/2014,Desogen
20, 1, Oral Contraceptive,Dizziness_ bloating_ fatigue_ no sex drive_ cysts in breasts. When I started taking Desogen 3 years ago_ I was fine and I felt no different besides some small mood swings. As time went on_ I gained weight in the thighs and hips (normal)_ breasts got larger_ and I developed IBS symptoms ( bloating and constipation). Just recently my breasts have been so painful... I can't do physical activities without feeling pain and it hurts when my boyfriend simply touches them... not fun. Found out I have cysts... clearly from the pill. I am so angry that it took 3 years for things to go wrong with this pill. Unbelievable.,,F,20,3  years.15 mg 1X D,5/21/2014,Desogen
21, 1, mainly to regulate menstruation,Cannot recall dosage because it was so king ago_ but I want ti add my experience. I was taking it for more than a year_ but did not connect the side effects with it_ because it was ny first time ever taking contraceptives. Weight gain (which was fine)_ breasts larger_ but worst was very severe mood swings that followed my cycle. When I discussed it with my gyn_ I s surprised that she did not report an adverse event. I feel this drug should be taken off the market.. I agree with many other commenters that when it spiked my emotions to the negative_ it was severe.,If it's not already off the market_ I think it should be_ or more research should be done to see if there are physical/clinical chracteristics that are indicators for individuals for whom Desogen should not be a choice. I entered the age around which I was taking the prescription.,F,28,1.5  years 1X D,4/19/2014,Desogen

27, 2, Birth Control,Breast were tender the first few weeks_ and I think they've grown. Two days before I was supposed to start my green pills for my period I had the worst cramps of my life. I couldn't move_ and had to wake my boyfriend up. He gave me Vicaden (sp?) to help and then had to carry me back to bed. I started my period 5 days late even though it's supposed to help regulate periods. I just started a new pack_ but I'll be waiting to see if it will work with preventing a pregnancy...,,F,19,1  months,8/29/2013,Desogen
28, 1, Contraceptive,Cystic acne_ weight gain_ headache_ very tender breasts and some cramping.,I have never had so many cystic blemishes at one time as I had when I started taking this birth control! At first I didn't realize the connection but once I did I started making plans to change as soon as the month was up. As soon as I started on the last week of the pack my face cleared right up!  I had also been wondering why in  the world ALL of my pants got so tight all of a sudden and now I realize.  My nurse practitioner changed me to desogen this year because I didn't want to gain any weight and she said this pill was very low hormone and wouldn't do so. There was nothing wrong with the pill I had been taking which is Tri-Linyah. I am back on that and experiencing breast tenderness as well but at least my face isn't broken out the way it was.

37, 1, Contraception/Acne,I was on Junel Fe for about a year and a half. My doctor changed my pill to apri_ the generic of desogen because I complained about my acne. I was so excited to try this pill to get rid of the acne.. Around the 6th day I started to feel very weird_ emotionally. I am ALWAYS an up beat person and never had problems with my emotions. It made me feel very weird_ just negative thoughts and just in general not a great mood as I usually am .. I stopped taking this pill as soon as I noticed a change in my mood. I am going to go back on the Junel Fe. Birth control is different for everyone and this pill may not be perfect for everyone_ it may work with others_ but for me it didn't.,,F,19,7  days30 mg,12/3/2012Email,Desogen

I have no sex drive what so ever to the point I'm confused on why im even taking birth control pills lol. Doesn't really help with acne but helps alot with cramping .

39, 2, contraception,omg this pill is horrible!!!! it made me gain like 20 pounds_ and i swear at least 10 of those pounds when to my thighs... not cool. It did make  my boobs bigger_ but its really not worth it. it also helps a little with acne. It has made me crazy the whole time I've been taking it. Mood swings_ anywhere from anger to just full blown rage over the smallest things. It made me very unhappy with life in general. It pretty much changed my whole personality. I'm sad for no reason at all and have absolutely no energy. That's just not me_ I've always been happy and upbeat. I also think thats what has been making me feel sick and dizzy too. It does seem to help with cramps_ but only because i take only the active pills for the most part_ if i take the nonactive ones i get a week of hell and stomach pains. As for sex drive... what sex drive? Even kissing grosses me out since taking this pill! It has just turned me into a very cold person and i hate that! Seriously reconsider taking this pill!!,for real this pill is horrible!,F,23,1.5  years 1X D,11/13/2012,Desogen

41, 1, Contraceptive,- migraines at least twice per month- no sex drive- no noticeable clearing of skin- lethargy,After one month of taking Reclipsen (the generic of Desogen)_ I began getting frequent migraine headaches - something I used to only ever get after a VERY strenuous workout. My sex-drive disappeared while I was on this pill. It took 3-4 months after stopping this pill before my sex drive began coming back. Having no sex-drive in a relationship is an unacceptable side effect for a pill that is supposed to enable sex!I felt tired and lethargic while on this pill. Before taking Desogen my boyfriend and I regularly enjoyed nights out with friends. Following1-2 months after beginning this pill_ I felt lethargic all day. I no longer had the same disposition while going out which lead to not wanting to spend nights out.I would never recommend this oral contraceptive based on my experience and other women's experiences.,F,22,5  months 1X D,10/22/2012,Desogen
42, 1, Contraceptive,I gained so much weight it isn't even funny. (I went from 135-160 lbs in less than 5months_ and my weight had been 135 for almost 2 years) Not really even an increased appetite either. Infact I worked out more and ate healthier :( also It caused me to become incredibly irrational_ argumentative and an over all negative person. I am exhausted all the time and have no desire to do anything on my days off. My body aches and this makes me so sad. I used to be a small_ pretty_ and over all happy person. This pill makes me hate my life in general. I need to find another pill or just get off this one!,DO NOT TAKE THIS PILL!,F,20,7  months 1X D,9/13/2012,Desogen
43, 1, birth control,complete lack of sex drive_ extreme mood swings_ irritability and anger,I used to be on a tri-phasic pill but the genius *sarcasm* doctor at planned parenthood said that someone my age shouldnt be on that type of pill and switch me to this horrible pill.  It completely killed my sex drive_ I was very easily irritated and angered_ and would have some pretty violent mood swings from being  depressed one minute angry the next and then incredibly happy.  Also_ this pill did absolutely nothing to help with cramps/PMS which used to be helped by the other bc I was on.  In short I would not recommend this pill to anyone.,F,22,6  months 1X D,8/20/2012Email,Desogen
44, 3, Birth Control,Sex drive so low that Ryan Gosling couldn't even turn me on_ bad dizziness in the first 2 weeks_ mood swings_ extremely emotional_ thoughts of suicide_ and slight weight gain.,I think the worst side effects of this pill are the lowered libido_ and occasionally considering suicide (which isn't normal for me) but everything else is tolerable.,F,19,1  months 1X D,7/19/2012,Desogen
45, 1, prevent pregnacy,I developed Deep Vein Thrombosis in my arm at age 34 back in 2009. I  had to self administer injections of Lovenox into my stomach and be on Coumadin blood thinners for 9 months. I was on bed rest for a few weeks and I could not work the whole time. Desogen did clear my acne up. It did give me bad mood swings. I was tired a lot and had no energy.,I would not recommend this pill to anyone. Too bad this pill wasn't Yaz or Orcella because I could be getting a big settlement. Nobody will help me with a Desogen case.,F,36,6  months 1X D,7/19/2012Email,Desogen
46, 1, Birth control,Horrible depression and rage. I have been on the pill for 15 years but recently was switched to Desogen because the clinic no longer carried my other BC. I have never experience this before. I was telling a friend about how crazy I had been and she asked what BC I was on. I never even thought about it being my BC since I have never had these problems with previous BC. I just want to be myself again!,,F,31,3  months1/day,7/10/2012,Desogen
47, 5, BC_ Bad Cramps without it,None noticed,I have had a great time with Desogen. My skin cleared a bit_ and my horrible cramps went away. I noticed no side affects at all. I used it to skip periods for three months straight and when I let myself have a period_ my uteran lining came out in one piece which creeped me out_ but that happens with lots of BC and was my own fault for skipping so many months. The generic_ Apri was fine too_ I took that back in college.,F,28,5  months 1X D,7/9/2012Email,Desogen
48, 1, Birth control,complete lack of sex drive_ random mood swings_ depression_ anxiety_ irritability_ random weight gain... helped my acne though pretty quick..,for three years I have been on a tri-cyclin birth control and this is my first time being on a monocyclin.. I requested to be switched because my previous birth control was starting to make me break out rather than prevent my acne. within a week or so I was noticing a drastic change in my sex-drive and felt horrible for my boyfriend because I usually have a very high drive. I also found myself starting to despise my boyfriend who is one of the sweetest people I've ever known.. Everything he does makes me irritated and I feel like I'm constantly angry at him. Incredibly irritable - even small things would set me off.. Also getting very depressed where I don't feel like doing anything and my outlook of life is just bad.. Everything seems horrible. I didn't even think it could be my birth control until I read these reviews.. I'm so glad i looked it up.. gonna call my doctor right away and get switched.,F,21,30  days 1X D,6/23/2012,Desogen

51, 1, Pregnancy prevention,Extreme mood swings_ periods lasting at most two days_ complete change of personality and out look of life_ negative thoughts_ angry outbursts_ very severe headaches_ fatigue_ loss of breath. But mostly the extremely negative mood swings.,I felt that it was a very good birth control for me because I felt normal for the whole month but when my period came around and passed and I began taking the pills after the seven days something in my head felt like it clicked and I had very severe headaches_ fatigue_ lack of breath_ and the most outstanding part of the side affects was the mood swings. Every month for a whole one to two weeks I would not be the same person_ and there was a lot of drama within my family because of my sudden changes and also with the relationship with my boyfriend. I would never recommend this pill to someone if they were to have the same results as I did.,F,16,3  months 1X D,5/26/2012Email,Desogen

53, 1, Acne_ endometriosis_ birth control.,After taking this pill for almost a year_ I've realized how awful it affected me. It helped clear up my acne quickly_ but oh man have I had the worst and craziest mood swings and anxiety!! I get super  irritated easily_ can't control my emotions_ get depressed and very tired throughout the day. I also want to eat  everything in sight. An awful thing as well is that I constantly bleed randomly throughout taking the pills when I should not be bleeding. I never stopped to consider that these symptoms were brought on from the birth control I was taking... But it definitely is. I would not recommend this pill to anyone!,,F,23,1  years,4/18/2012,Desogen
54, 2, Clear up acne,Acne didn't clear up. Breast tenderness_ anxiety and panic attacks_ breasts got a little bigger that was the only plus. Super bad cramps on my period!!

55, 2, To prevent pregnancy,Migranes_ SEVER anxiety_ nausea_ vomiting_ heart palpitations,I tried this pill a year ago and didn't like it so I'm not really sure why my doctor put me on it again but oh well. I took it for a total of 2 days this time and the side effects were the same and just as horrible as before. I had a severe migrane yesterday with nausea and anxiety and today I woke up in a panic attack with nausea and vomiting. I called my doctor and I'm switching tomorrow. Thank goodness. Again_ everyone is different so maybe it will work for you but it just didn't work for me. Estrogen really messes with me in the first place so this wasn't really a surprise that it failed.,F,22,3  days30MG 1X D,4/10/2012Email,Desogen
56, 2, Prevent pregnancy,Suicidal ideation_ lack of sex drive_ continual cramping_ excessive weight gain_ depression,I wish I'd never taken this pill. I was on Ortho-Tricyclen Lo for almost a year before I got pregnant and miscarried. My doctor decided Desogen was a better replacement for the Ortho_ and it worked great for preventing pregnancy. However_ it did so because I found my husband's touch revolting...we only had sex an average of once every two months. And that was after I got tired of him badgering me for it. I was constantly angry and depressed over nothing. I cried all the time over nothing. Every day I drove I wanted to drive my car off the bridges and cliffs I passed. I thought about shooting myself. I never think like that_ ONLY when I was on this pill. It got so bad my husband told me to stop taking it because risking pregnancy was better than risking my sanity/life. I've been fine ever since I got off that pill_ it's just taken awhile to work the weight off. My suggestion would be if you try_ stop taking it as soon as you start to feel any of those side effects during times other than menstruation. Good luck!,F,26,3  years 1X D,3/14/2012Email,Desogen
57, 1, Due to my Endometriosis,I've got Endometriosis and High Blood Pressure.  I'm a student so due to no insurance I went to my local health department and was given this to try.  I only took TWO pills but I noticed an immediate change in my body.  After a few hours of taking this med I was extremely tired.  I had absolutely no energy.  I also found myself extremely irritated with the sound of my brothers voice??  What's up with that..right?  At one point I even asked him to shut up.  That only led to an argument...which I'm sure I won. By day two my blood pressure (which by the way was doing so well due to my new exercise regiment that I no longer needed to take my pills) spiked to 143/99 and my pulse dropped to 55 beats per minute.  Needless to say I quickly popped two blood pressure pills.  I also noticed extreme bloating and edema in my legs.  This is a terrible drug!  I've decided to stop taking these pills IMMEDIATELY and call my doctor in the morning.  My advice to you....be very aware of your body and know,Pay attention to your body!,F,28,2  days28 day 1X D,3/5/2012,Desogen
58, 1, Birth Control,INSOMNIA and when it wasn't insomnia_ complete and utter fatigue. So bad I couldn't function. Eating everything in sight. Bad moods_ anxiety attacks,The only reason why I'm sticking with this pill to the end of the month is so I don't get irregular bleeding. It's absolutely terrible. This is the worst birth control pill I've ever been on. The worst is how it makes me feel. I'm either really really tired (falling asleep in my classes - I'm a college student) or I'm up pulling an all nighter for no reason. I have never felt this much of a lack of energy. It even kills me when I go to the gym_ which is supposed to give you energy. This pill is affecting all my mental and physical problems. I was diagnosed with Gastroparesis recently and since I'm eating everything_ my stomach hurts all the goddamn time. My anxiety is way worse. I'm having panic attacks for no reason and I can't breathe most of the time because my chest tightens up so bad. Honestly this is been the longest most painful month of my life.

62, 4, I am taking Desogen for PCOS,great with weight loss. already down 20 lbs and only my 2nd month. HORRIBLE CRAMPS!! And an increase in migrain frequency.,I have been on Apri 30mg (desogen) BCP for a little less then 2 months. I like it mainly because it is reversing the 2 worst symptoms of PCOS the weight gain and the acne. I am already down 20lbs and have 2 weeks left on my 2nd pack. Acne is doing well too. I still break out but only the week before i get my period. The downfall of Apri...is the HORRID_ EXCRUSIATING cramping. for about a week or so (like 2-3 days over a week) before my period came last month and about 2 days over a week this month.. The cramps are the worst i have ever experienced. Dizzy_ nausious_ sharp pains on my sides where my ovaries are and in my back. I mean ill granted 2 weeks out of the month im in bad pain but for me its worth it if the medication is helping me lose weight and making my face clear. I dot have any intentions of stoping this medication. Also the other bad thing is the week before my period comes_ I get a bad migrain about every day untill my peroid is over.,F,25,2  months30mg 1X D,12/23/2011Email,Desogen

The only problem I have with it is that I started getting acne on my chest.. which I never did before. I switched to this off of another BC to give me lighter periods_ which it definitely did. I sometimes only have it 2 days. My libido stayed the same and didn't have any 'dryness' at all. My doctor gave me enough for a year so I can't really change now.

Then it went away and since then_ I've felt good_ normal_ and NOT PREGNANT (yay!).,I didn't gain weight - in fact_ I lost it_ but that was more to do with regular sleep / exercise than pills. I did not suffer from worsened period symptoms_ nausea_ headaches_ bone problems_ or moodiness. In fact_ I kind of mellowed out a little_ but again_ that was more from lifestyle changes than the chemicals in the pills...the fact that the pill affected me so little that I could function normally is a good sign.

70, 3, contraception_ endometriosis,Less acne_ shorter and less painful periods_ sore and swollen breasts_ nausea & (rarely) vomiting with first couple pills of each pack_ lower sex drive_ increase in depressed feelings_ lethargy_ and anxiety.,"I've been on Desogen then Ortho-Cept then Apri (all the same med_ just different brands) for 4.5 years on and off. It helped manage my endometriosis and I never got pregnant. I never got any headaches or gained any weight whatsoever. Appetite has reamined static. Overall this was a good pill for me_ despite the lower sex drive and increased depression/lethargy_ which I'm sure all pills will give me anyway. However_ over the last 7 months I've had spotting & acne starting midway through the pack and continuing until my period. The Dr. told me this is due to the estrogen dose not being high enough_ so I'm (rather nervously) starting Sprintec. Why the dose needs to be so high is a mystery to me; I'm 5'7 and 116 pounds. Remember that all pills will affect women differently_ and will affect you differently depending on your stage in life.

I never really thought about what it meant to supplement your hormones and now I know. I've never been so negative in my life and ending birth control has really screwed me up. I'm never taking a hormonal bc again. I just want my hormones to balance out naturally and be done with this already.,It's great if you don't mind not having any emotions_ sex drive_ losing your hair_ losing your appetite.

I switched to Reclipsen a little over 3 months ago when the birth control I was taking_ Levora_ was causing me breakthrough bleeding. My doctor recommended it because the progestin was different and she thought my body might like it better.  For the first month everything was wonderful_ I was extremely please with this pill_ I had absolutely no side effects. Unfortunately the next month is when the acne/ skin irritation- which I have always had clear skin- kicked in and I started to feel a little moody; getting weepy for no reason. The third full month I was definitely more moody_ but it wasn't until the first week of this month that I really noticed how terrible it was effecting me. I seriously feel emotionally unstable and my partner has told me he thinks it is from the pill and I absolutely agree.

I am fair-med skin (tans in summer) and have combo skin (more oily in summer_ more dry in winter) and prone to breakouts. For the first 2 months_ my face was TERRIBLE_ the worst its ever been_ the breakouts were almost unbearable. I would have up to 6 lg. blemishes_ including cystic acne. I wanted to cry and give up but after reading some reviews and talking with my doctor_ they said that it takes a few months for you body to get use to the hormones. Now after 3 months_ my face is pretty much clear_ except for scaring from those 2 months which i've been using clinique even better dark spot corrector for and they are definitely fading. During the 3rd pill pack i only got a few small blemishes that were totally bearable. I also started using Proactiv during the first pill pack b/c my acne was soooo soooo terrible and so i think that has definitely helped clear up my face a ton too. I also switched my makeup to bareminerals (i was soo desperate to clear up my face from apri). After 3 months of using the combo of apri_ proactiv_ and bareminerals_ my face is pretty much clear except for the scaring(hyperpigmentation) that is fading.

It took me a long time to find a birth control I was happy with_ but this is the one for me. My skin is clear and my moods are much more controlled than with other pills.

I started on Desogen and noticed I was having weird nightmares pretty consistantly.  Im not taking any other prescriptions_ so to make sure it was this pill that was causing the nightmares I stopped taking it.

Headaches,I used to take Marvelon (the European Desogen) for many years since high school. For the past couple of years my acne got worse_ so first I started taking doxycycline but it was not easy taking it as any antibiotic_ so I asked to switch to oral contraceptives. I ordered a generic version_ Reclipsen.I've listed the side effects. On a bright side_ my period got lighter and my breast got fuller_ but it is so not worth it because I feel indifferent...

I don't need it to prevent pregnancy_ just for clear skin_ less random hair growth and more even moods. I liked Ortho Evra and Yaz but the health concerns scared me off of them. Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol doesn't sound any better but for me_ as horribly vain as this may sound_ I'd rather risk taking birth control pills than feel horrible about myself with the bad skin and moodiness. When I get off pills_ the acne/random hair growth is uncontrollable. I can't help but wonder if I had avoided pills my whole life if these side effects would have taken care of themselves.

I had negative thoughts running through my head constantly_ couldnt sleep at night_ wanted to sabotage my relationship with my great boyfriend and stopped caring about work.  I started breaking out all over my back and face with acne and my eyes became super sensitive to light (which would cause migraines).   I have always been a happy person and NEVER have had even the slightest bit of depression_ and within a month of this pill_ I was feeling like I was headed for the loony bin!  I have probably cried every day for the last few weeks and before that I hadnt cried for years!! I stopped the pill 3 days ago and woke up this morning feeling like I came out of a dream/nightmare.  Thank god my boyfriend asked why I was acting different and then mentioned hormones because I would have never thought my birth control would cause thisbut after reading all these reviews_ I know for a fact that is what was causing all my problems.

I need bc to counter perimenopause symptoms.  I found this pill was terrific at controlling the perimenopause symptoms_ and although there was a hint of a migraine_ the full fledged migraine did not hit me.  But_ the imsomnia is awful -- trouble falling asleep_ and feeling like I wasn't getting any deep sleep at all.  Today is the day I would normally get my period_ and although it has not arrived_ I instead am having massive dizziness.

If the clot ever dislodges itself from my leg_ it could travel straight to my heart and cause death_ so this filter is suposed to catch and stop the clot.,I had no problems with Desogen. I am still in shock about getting this blood clot two years later. I never smoked before and the blood test results the hospital did confirmed it was from the birth control pill.

I frequently exercise and have not in any way altered my diet. I have experienced an increase in hunger as well. Moreover_ I have low energy_ thus making it difficult to exercise as often and as thoroughly as I'd like. - Nausea! In fact_ I feel nauseous at this very moment. I've felt bloated and nauseous for the past few days.  I've been absent from school multiple time during the past week I've been taking Desogen because of this frequent nausea.- None of my friends or family are able to explain why I've been so irritable during the past week. I've reprimanded my boyfriend within the past 7 days_ snapped at him_ cried_ and thrown a temper tantrum over the most trivial matters.  - This is what I am most fearful of: pregnancy after the third day of taking Desogen. Of course_ I read the fine print that stated I should use a back up contraceptive until the seventh day on the pill. That would've been a nice tip to give a girl before taking her first birth control pill.

I restarted the second pack to start IVF this month ( for the 1st time) and had to stop it after 2 days...the NP put me on Loestrin. I hope I don't have the same side effects...I just took it now.  I feel like myself today.  The swelling kinda scared me and I hate that it took me a while to figure out what was causing it.,F,41,21  days 1X D,3/3/2010,Desogen

156, 2, Birth Control; Mood Swings,Headache_ Eczema_ Dry Eyes_ Trouble sleeping.,"This is a review for the generic APRI.  Took Generic Reclipsen for a month with no issues.  CVS didn't have Reclipsen and switched me to Apri.  I HATE Apri_ I'm only on the first week and I have a breakout of eczema around my mouth that is so ugly.  My eyes are super dry and I have a killer headache.  I NEVER get headaches.  I think I'm allergic to the Red 40 food dye.  I never had a issue with Yaz or Reclipsen_ but Apri makes me feel like crap! and it's only the first week.  I also haven't been sleeping well this whole week.  From the Article on Associated Content ""Is the Red 40 Food Dye Additive Having a Negative Impact on Your Child? January 31_ 2007 by Katherine M.""

158, 5, Birth control & acne,3 pound weight gain_ cramps,I love this pill! My first pill was Ortho-Tri Cyclin Lo and it was horrible_ I broke out with painful cystic acne and gained around 20 pounds the first month and has HORRIBLE PMDD symptoms and after month 3 nothing changed so I decided to go back to Planned Parenthood to get a new pill. The doctor decided that a monophasic pill was best for my body_ so she gave me Desogen Lo. It comes in a cute little pink box and apart from gaining only 3 pounds (which most noticably went to my breasts) these pills are SO much better than ortho tri. My face is never oily anymore_ I didn't gain a lot of weight_ and I don't even have to have my period. I love these pills and I'm going back to get more soon! The only thing that bothers me is that when I purposefully skip out on my period bybnot taking the inactive pills_ I get horrible cramps at random times for no reason. But I'm willing to put up with that.,F,17,2  months,1/4/2010,Desogen
159, 1, birth control,lack of sex drive.... and possibly worse cramps during menstruation?,For me_ this did not work at all.  It was very effected birth control in that I never felt like having sex_ so there was zero chance of pregnancy.,F,22,3  months,12/25/2009,Desogen
160, 5, Extremely Irregular Period Cycle,For the first two weeks I was slightly nauseated. I knew it was my body getting use to the new birth control.,Love it! I tried Tri-Cyclen_ Tri-Cyclen Lo_ and Yaz. All three made me insane and angry. My cramps were awful_ my mood swings weren't just saved for the few days before I started my period but the whole time I was on the pills. The only time I felt normal was when I wasn't taking my pills for my period week lol. Desogen is wonderful! I hate that some people are saying STAY AWAY just because it didn't work for them. Everyone is different and unfortunately birth control is a trial and error thing. Fourth time was a charm for me. My periods only last three days_ my cramps are light_ and my mood doesn't swing.

164, 1, Birth Control,"Prescribed Desogen and experienced some weight gain. When I switched health insurance plans at 6 months taking Desogen I was prescribed Apri (generic) and was told by pharmacist that the pills were ""exactly the same."" Experienced mood swings_ irritability_ and only a week into taking Apri I developed a persistent headache. By the end of that first month taking Apri I had a stroke. The stroke has left lasting cognitive impairment.",3rd generation pills carry higher risks of stroke than 2nd generation birth control pills_ although this higher risk was not clearly expressed by the manufacturer or explained by my physicians.,F,23,7  months,12/8/2009,Desogen

After dealing with some side effects while adjusting the first month or so_ I was great after that! My mood swings are relatively gone compared to before_ and now I only get a little sad for a day or two when I should be starting_ if that. My boyfriend has even noticed the difference. My periods tend to be painful but with Apri I can simply skip the sugar pills and not have one! Its great!Also_ I was ecstatic about the breast growth for the first few months_ but it seems to have come back down a bit as my body's adjusted to the hormones...

Desogen made me so moody and I would cry over anything. When I had my periods I would clot so bad that I had to change about every 2 hours_ never clotted before. I gained so much weight and I was eating the same and even exercising. My sex drive basically vanished_ I developed migraines shortly after taking this_ which later found out that it can be really serious. I quit taking immediately after I found that out_ its only been 4 days_ but I swear I can tell a difference.

177, 2, BC_ acne_ irregular periods,"NUMBNESS.  Physical and emotional numbness.  General feeling of disinterest in life.  Like I was kind of floating through... no emotions_ like I didn't care much about anything.  I felt indifferent about things that I thought I would be ecstatic about_ things that I had been looking forward to for months.  I suddenly had such a hard time getting an orgasm_ and the few times that it would happen_ it would be really minor.  Absolutely horrible.  It strained my relationship with a new guy that I hooked up with.  I was starting to think that we were sexually incompatible... that is_ until I got off the pill.  Within days I was feeling more ""alive""_ like life was suddenly colorful for me again_ and I started being able to orgasm again.The other side effect I noticed was mild breast tenderness during the first two weeks of being on the pill... I didn't mind that so much.  It's the numbness that I couldn't take.",This was the first hormonal BC method I'd ever used.  I liked that my acne seemed to clear up and I got my period according to schedule.  But because of the side effects_ I stopped taking it and now I'm not sure if I ever want to use pills again.  It's just not worth it if the primary reason you went on the pill (i.e. to have sex without worrying about getting pregnant) becomes uninteresting to you.In addition_ there's a public petition to ban desogestrel (an ingredient in Desogen) because there are much higher risks of blood clots (venous thrombosis) associated with it compared to other hormones.  This happens to healthy young women who are not predisposed to blood clots.  I'm just glad it didn't happen to me!  Here's the link:http://www.citizen.org/publications/release.cfm?ID=7503I know every woman's body is different_ and some women may feel great on this pill_ but please think LONG and HARD if you are on this pill or want to go on this pill.

196, 4, Contraception and regulate periods,none except decrease in libido.,I have been taking OC's for 20 years now. The last 7 of them have been on Apri_ the generic of Desogen. My period comes exactly every 25 days_ on a Tuesday_ around 11 am. Experience nausea once in a great while. I have gained weight over the years_ but that can be attributed to cheez-its and wine every night. When I want to loose weight_ I am able to. Libido is low_ but that can also be caused by 2 young children_ work and the ups and downs of life in general. Went off the Apri a few months ago because I accidentally flipped the package upside down and started on the placebo pills! So I tried an IUD for 6 weeks and hated it. Went back to the Apri because I never really had problems with it and I knew what to expect. Overall_ it has been a good experience for me.,F,38,7  years,7/8/2009,Desogen

The first 5-6 years_ I loved it.  My skin cleared.  My periods were light and regular.  I think I might have even LOST about 4 to 5 pounds of bloat-weight.  Beginning about four years ago_ however_ my body began responding differently to Desogen.  My sex drive plummeted out of nowhere.  It had always been healthy before.  Dark patches began appearing on my forehead_ nose_ and above my upper lip.  My hair began thinning noticeably along my forehead-hairline.  I do not do drugs_ and I do not drink alcohol very much.  I eat and sleep well and get exercise.  My dr. says that a woman's body--and  hormones--can change through the years.  Hormone levels are not ""static.""  Perhaps my own hormones responded well to those in Desogen in the beginning.  But eventually_ something changed.  This was not my lifestyle or habits.  But just perhaps my body's response to this pill.  I would recommend Desogen to women for a period of no more than 5 years.  I am beginning to think that perhaps any oral contraceptive should not be taken for more than 5 years.  It seems too unnatural.  Maybe this is my body's way of telling me that it misses my fertility.  I will stop taking it at the end of this month.",F,31, ,6/29/2009,Desogen

I know that doesn't seem like a lot of time to be able to tell a difference. But so far I've gained two pounds (mostly in my breasts_ I think). I've gone up 1/2 a cup size. For the first two days I had a series of mood swings. One so bad that I ended up breaking a mirror in anger and then crying because I felt guilty and then suddenly feeling much better. However as of the past 4 days I've had a constant blissful mood. I've eaten less and my acne has decreased. I never experienced the ""initial breakout"" that many fear while taking BC. The side effects lasted a short time and were not any real hassle. Of course_ it varies between people. But overall I've been pretty happy with this drug.",F,17,1  weeks,6/22/2009,Desogen
202, 3, contraceptive/irregular cycles,breast tenderness_ increased size (not a bad thing)_ NO sex drive at all_ wonky appetite_ moodiness_ random spotting,The bummer part of these side effects is that they have just appeared (except for the low sex drive - that's been around for a while) and I have been on this for 2+ years. So time to hunt for a new pill.,F,26,2.5  years,6/16/2009,Desogen
203, 5, ,Desogen seems great so far_ I switched off Yazmin which may I say is  crazy pill NEVER TAKE IT! Desogen has helped my mood swings and the only bothersome side effect was nausea and bloating. The nauses has gone away within 2 weeks and it seems to be smooth sailing,,F,18, ,6/11/2009,Desogen
204, 2, BC and cysts,I started having nausea_ feeling pregnant_ gagging at sights and smells.  I have been having some stomache pain and at first I had trouble having an O but now I have no sex drive at all.  I looked on line to see if these were side effects of this medicine because these things are new to me and sure enough they are all listed here.  I never had acne and still don't and I haven't experienced the increased breast size.  I am getting off this tomorrow.  It's not worth the strain on my marriage.  Oh_ did I mention mood swings.  My husband thinks I have been acting crazy.,,F,38,9  days,6/6/2009,Desogen
205, 4, birth control,Irritable_ anxiety_ oversensitive_ breast tenderness,I switched to the generic version_ Apri_ last month from Loestrin.  I have my sex drive back and my appetite is under control_ both things I had problems with on Loestrin.  I also seem to be slowly slimming back down to my normal weight (I went up 15 lbs on Loestrin).  the only problem is that mood wise_ I really don't feel like myself.  I have horrible anxiety_ and am generally kind of cranky and whiny.  I did find that I can keep the emotional side effects under control with B vitamins and L-Theanine supplements_ but if my moods don't start to stabilize at least a little bit I may change again.  My breasts look great though even if they are a little sore.,F,27,3  weeks,6/3/2009,Desogen
206, 1, acne,"I am 34_ mom of 2. Up until trying for children I had been on Desogen for over 5 years with no side effects.  Now_ my youngest being 2 I have been getting breakouts on my face.  My doc suggested this was because I am not on the pill.  So_ I do have the ""no hormorne"" IUD and just went on Reclipsin(the generic for Desogen)to help treat the once a month break out.  OMG...  I feel Lethargic_ much less patience_ spotting_ irritability_ chest tightness_ and just sad. I have never had these symptoms prior.  It's much like the first 6-8 weeks of pregnancy feeling this way. I am going to stop taking this and hope for the best with the break outs.  It's just not worth the moodiness for a pimple  :)",,F,34,8  days,5/18/2009,Desogen
207, 1, cramps,bloating_ cramps_ intense headaches_ irregular periods,i originally started taking desogen to get rid of my sevre cramps that come on the first day of my period. I've been off and on my period for 3 months with a day or two of spotting in between_ it has become heavioer and my cramps are coming more frequent. ive also been feeling bloated non stop and i got sevre headaches to the point of me passing out.

Now i have been very angry and moody all the time. I freak out over everything and cant control my anger. I was never like this before i started taking this birth control.Im with my husband its our first year being married and he cant stand to see me like this. Now i know why im acting this way and im def switching over to a different pill.,F,20,2  years,5/10/2009,Desogen
209, 4, acne-control,I have been taking desogen for two weeks now and I have not stopped spotting since starting the pill_ however_ I started my period upon beginning the pill and it was extremely light and I had no pms symptoms whatsoever.  My breasts have been tender since starting the pill but they have also grown/filled out_ they look good w/o a bra again! Very happy w/ my breasts on this pill!  My acne has not cleared up or gotten worse.,,F,28,14  days,4/30/2009,Desogen
210, 1, prevent pregnancy,Crazy mood swings_ would be fine and then just flip out for no reason.  Decreased sex drive_ vaginal dryness and yeast infections_ headaches_ nausea every day.,I only had to be on desogen as i am on a antidepressant for my PMDD and the doctor said to do this one. I hate it and my boyfriend hates my decreased sex drive as i do also.  I really like ortho tri cyclen as it really helped with my bad cramps that i get with my period.  I am going to switch now as i am taking the pills when my period is suppose to come.,F,21,1  months,4/27/2009,Desogen
211, 2, birth control,mood swings_ stomach pains_ tiredness_ depression_ NO sex drive,This is the only brith control I've tried and I hate it! My. Dr suggested I stay on it for at least a year to see if the side effects would go away_ but they haven't.  I started Desogen one month before I got married and for about the frist two months of my marriage I had a desire for sex.  Now_ nothing!  I finished out this month and my husband and I have chosen to try natural forms of birth control. Hopefully I'll be back to normal soon.  I'd warn girls to stay away from this drug!,F,24,1  years,4/17/2009,Desogen

Such terrible nausea. one night i ended up just passing out on my bed in my clothes because my head and stomach hurt so bad. Also_ have been sleeping so much_ partly to control the headaches which don't respond to medicine_ and partly because I get tired from almost anything. :[ i took desogen about 2 years ago for a year and it was fine_ just having problems now,F,19,3  weeks,4/8/2009,Desogen
216, 4, Pregnancy Prevention,Nausea (worse in early mornings)_ some moodiness.,I read a lot of the reviews for Desogen before I started taking it.  I'll admit_ I was somewhat concerned looking at a lot of the reviews especially the ones about becoming moody and funny things happening with my period.  But it's been fine for the most part.  I've lost weight_ my face is clearing up and I have really severe acne_ I know when to expect my period now which is something I've always had an issue with.  Also_ the first period I had Desogen was the greatest period I ever had_ I hardly bled and I didn't have any cramps which was a first for me.  I do get pretty nauseous in the mornings from it which is a pain because I'm on my way to work at that time.  I have also noticed that I can be more emotional_ more apt to cry and moody which my fiance doesn't appreciate and I don't either.  I don't like not having control over my emotions.  But I can pretty much sense the mood swing coming so it's not usually a problem.  This is the first time I've ever been on birth control but everything seems ok for now.,F,24,2  months,4/3/2009,Desogen
217, 1, birth control,Mood Swings_Vaginal Dryness_ Loss of Sex Drive,I hate this pill. I finally realized this pill was making me sick after reading some of these comments and after 2 years decided to stop taking it and look for another birth control pill and am considering tying my tubes.I thought it was just me going crazy or feeling unsexy. With Desogen_ before my periods I would have mood swings where I was so upset_ mad_ and sad for no reason. I would feel like a differrent person when I acted like this.My family had to suffer with this. My sex drive did go down and I had vaginal dryness even when I was turned on. This wasn't normal for me because I always had a great interest in sex. I have also gained weight and I think 's because of the pill.,F,30,2  years,3/25/2009,Desogen

224, 1, as a form of not getting pregnant,nausea_ vomiting_ stomach cramps_ headaches_ mood swings_ and pregnancy symptoms...,I really do think that this product may help women not get pregnant_ but the side affects are too great to continue taking this medication.

This second month has been bad. Im really tired normally finding myself napping in the middle of the day_ every little thing upsets me and makes me cry_ my headaches have been extreamly bad along the nausea. This pill isnt for everyone just isnt working too good for me.,F,18,2  months,1/24/2009,Desogen

I am changing to ortho tri cylen...,F,19,5  months,1/22/2009,Desogen
228, 3, Acne_ cramps_ pregnancy prevention,My acne has cleared up a little bit_ but it could be just because I'm getting older *I'm now 18*.I started taking BC *tricylinlow* when I was 15_ and have recently switched to Desogen because Tricylinlow wasn't cutting it for me for my acne. My periods are indeed lighter_ and less intense_ but my sex drive has decreased. When I'm off Desogen for about a month or so_ my sex drive is pretty awesome_ and my boyfriend is happy about that.But still_ not having a safety net of BC makes things hard_ and constantly worried about being pregnant.,So in short_ my acne has cleared up a bit_ slight increase in breast size_ better periods_ better thoughts about not being pregnant_ but a decrease in sex drive.Ever girl is different_ so therefore different results for everyone :D,F,18,3  years,1/18/2009,Desogen

233, 5, severe cramps,decrease in cramping_ increased breast size! decrease in acne. ever so slightly more emotional. weight loss. no loss in sex drive.,Because of severe cramping I've been on birth control since i was in the 7th grade. I started out with the patch which didn't last long and then switched to Seasonale. My doctor put me on Seasonale because all the pain killers (ie. motrin_ vicodin_ percocet) for the cramps every month could have potetially given me heart/ stomach problems so she thought it was safer to put me on a multi month pack. After taking seasonale for 5 years i had gained a ravinous apitite along with 25lbs._ fatigue_ and no decrease in cramping. My doctor then decided to put me on reclipsen (a generic for desogen) wich i now take on a two month basis and so far i've had tremendous luck with it. I lost the 25 lbs._ feel much better and my cramps have decreased by about 80 percent.,F,19,7  months,12/21/2008,Desogen
234, 5, birth control,NONE,I did not get even one side effect from Desogen. My period came like clockwork every month and was shorter_ lighter and came with less cramps than it did before i went on them. I was on Desogen for 8 years and the only reason that i stopped is because my pharmacy and other pharmacies near me had stopped carrying them. I have been on Depo_ Seasonale_ Seasonique_ Yasmin and Yaz_ and i have had side effects with every single one.,F,28,8  years,12/17/2008,Desogen

237, 4, treat endometriosis_ contraception,spotting in the first month_ breast tenderness_ breast growth_ clearer skin_ FAR less painful periods_ nausea_ vomiting_ occasional mood swings_ recently a serious lack of sex drive.,I took Desogen for 20 months. I've only stopped because my local Planned Parenthood stopped carrying it and put me on Ortho Cept. Desogen has prevented pregnancy and stopped my horrific monthly pain from endometriosis. At first I had very little adverse side effects; it worked well. Over the last few months though my sex drive has absolutely plummeted and I've had lots of nausea. My relationship with my boyfriend is suffering because I am NEVER in the mood anymore_ and this upsets me too because I miss being a sexual person. Also_ after the first pill of every new pack I would get extreme nausea and sometimes vomit. This past pill pack I had slight nausea almost every day (no vomiting_ though) which was irregular. Hopefully Ortho Cept will be better.,F,19,20  months,12/13/2008,Desogen
238, 5, ,,"I just wanted to say that while the Desogen and generic Apri are the same hormone amounts_ the inactive ingredients are different! Apri has Red Lake #40 which is a dangerous dye_ as well as indigo dye which is used for jeans_ etc. There are also some other differences as well. I live in Maine_ where your doctor (until recently) had to request on the prescription to give you the name brand. I just went from Apri back to Desogen. I was on the UK version Marvelon when I lived in London for a few years. There is a major difference in the way my body reacts to the difference in inactive ingredients between the two.

I cried the entire day of my birthday last week_ for no reason. I was going to give it the 3 months to see if the emotional side effects decreased_ but I dont know if I can mentally handle it_ so I'm not sure what to do.,F,25,1  months,12/5/2008,Desogen
240, 4, To prevent pregnancy,Intense stomache pain. Slightly worse acne than before I took this birth control.,Besides the occasional (intense)stomache pain Desogen has been working great for me! I have lost almost 10 lbs on it. It has kind of made me less hungry all the time_ but then I only eat when I am actually hungry! So I do not think that is a bad thing. One thing though_ it did not help my acne and I wish it did. My breasts did get a bit bigger.,F,21,4  months,12/4/2008,Desogen

I knew I'd probably experience a few side effects because my natural hormones are so accustomed to doing it themselves--they wouldn't want to be told what to do. This pill made me miserable. My acne immediately flared up_ I had anxious panic attacks in the middle of class_ dizziness_ extreme appetite. I couldn't work out at the gym without feeling like I was going to absolutely die of fatigue afterwards. I couldn't function normally as a student or a person. As a result_ my boyfriend thinks I'm halfway crazy and my grades have suffered severely. Be careful.,F,22,28  days,11/28/2008,Desogen
243, 4, Birth Control,Breasts larger within 2 weeks of beginning to take it_ increased emotions and aniety_  no apparent loss of sex drive when in the moment...but less desire during normal times of the day when I would have otherwise maybe had sexual urges.,I like that it's monophasic... skip the placebo pills and you can skip your period.  I plan on skipping my period most of the time.  There is no evidence that this is dangerous at all.  My anxiety could be attribted to other things going on in my life_ though. Overall_ this is MUCH MUCH better than any of the Ortho tricyclin pills!!  Trust me!,F,25,1  months,11/21/2008,Desogen

247, 5, BC_ acne_ lack of estrogen,I'm the one who did the review back in 5/29/2008.  I just like to update my progress on it.  Side effects now experienced are low libido (but that comes with every bc)_ and thats it,"I guess eevryone's different and I was able to find a bc that worked for me.  I've tried so many in the past_ became such a monster on some_ but this is the only one that keeps me feeling ""normal"" and provides the right amount of estrogen & prog. for me.  I wanted to use bc for clearing up my acne too_ which has been cleared 95% of the time since on this.  I get the occasional zit during periods.  I cant be happier on this pill.  My face has never been clear since I was 17_ and now i'm 27.  Thats about 10 yrs!  So i'm really taking advantage of this by using the best skincare for my acne-free face now.  I also only take the brand Desogen_ not Apri.  Tried Apri_ doesnt work as well for me_ my acne seemed to come back on it.  My moods are the same as when i'm not on bc_ so this is good_ no unusual emotional breakdowns etc.  Taking bc has also made my skin more resilent and younger looking_ maybe b/c I lack estrogen production on my own due to my hormonal imbalance.

The first few days I had horrible migraines. They were so bad that I couldn't even get out of bed. I'm not sure about loss of sex drive but that's the last thing I want to think about because all I want to do is throw up. I switched from Depo because my Dr. recommended it since the Depo made me break out so much. I think I might go back to Depo since I never had any bad side effects besides the acne.,F,25,15  days,10/13/2008,Desogen
256, 1, ,severe mood swings_ lack of sex drive_ breast tenderness,When I went to pick up my regular birth control pills_ the lady informed me that they stopped providing that particular brand and handed me Desogen and said to switch to it. So far it has been 3 weeks and I'm a wreck. Usually_ with my former birth control I was more balanced and rarely had mood swings_ however in the past few weeks my mood swings have been pretty severe. I go from happy and euphoric to crazy and angry in a matter of moments. I can't stand feeling like this so I plan on throwing away the other packets I purchased and finding a doctor who actually consults with me before prescribing an entirely new birth control.,F,20,3  weeks,10/3/2008,Desogen
257, 2, birthcontrol,HORRIBLE mood swings_ 10-12 lb. weight gain within first few months_ HIGHLY DECREASED SEX DRIVE.,I've been taking this birthcontrol since I was 16. Despite the wonderful ability to know exactly what time my period is coming_ and the cleared up complexion_ there are some not so awesome side effects: nausea_ mind-numbing headaches occasionally_ terrible terrible mood swings_ weight gain_ and nearly nonexistant sex-drive. I will flip out about something_ and 30 seconds later wonder why I'm so upset. Crying too. I'm planning on switching to an IUD soon_ with fewer crazy hormones.,F,20,4  years,9/28/2008,Desogen
258, 5, Birth Control,I have been on Desogen for about 8 months now and I really enjoy it a lot better than the Depo Shot. My periods are much more normal_ and I pretty much exactly when it's going to be time and when it will stop.,,F,24,8  months,9/20/2008,Desogen
259, 4, birth control_ period control,decreased sex drive_ weight gain,I started taking desogen almost 3 years ago because I was traveling out of the country and wanted a way to make sure I wouldn't get my period unexpectedly. I had a fairly normal cycle prior to starting the pill_ although sometimes it seemed like a very short time between periods. Since I've been on the pill_ my acne hasn't really cleared up at all_ my sex drive is pretty low_ and in maybe the last year or so? my cramps have been pretty bad_ could be more stress though? But it did deliver regular_ predictable periods for me. Only a couple of times though- but both times I was out of the country_ did I start my period without warning_ which was super annoying when I was in a foreign country. I also used 6 weeks of active desogen pills before taking the inactive pills for my period_ which my body adapted to really well. I just took my first Seasonique pill to see if it has more beneficial effects for me_ but after reading some reviews I might just go back to desogen.,F,22,3  years,9/15/2008,Desogen
260, 3, Prevent Pregnancy_ help with acne,DECREASED SEX DRIVE_ sporadic but severe depression_ suicidal thoughts when depressed_ mood swings,It helped with my acne but gave me terrible mood swings.  I am normally a very happy and tolerant person_ but Desogen made me crazy.  My sex drive was also decreased SIGNIFICANTLY.  I'm not lying_ ask my boyfriend.  Switching to microgestin 1/20 fe with less estrogen.  Hopefully it won't make me a crazy person.,F,20,2  months,9/15/2008,Desogen
261, 5, Prevent getting pregnet,None yet just started taking it today.,I was on Yaz for years and loved it however at 150.00 dollars for a two month supply_ it got to be to much money. I hope that it works well and I dont get to many of the bad side effects. I will report back later.,F,24,1  days,9/6/2008Email,Desogen
262, 5, Low hormone imbalance,Heavy periods,Ive been dealing with hormonal imbalance issues since Ive went through puberty. Finally at age 15_ I was put on Desogen to straighten out my problems.  Cleared up my acne_ helped me shed a few pounds_ made my hair feel thick and lush. My only complaint that I can really recall is that it caused heavy periods. I was on it for 4yrs then decided to try Depo-Provera (the shot_ worst mistake in my life) and had major problems since then.  Ive been on a lot of BC's_ and so far Desogen and Yaz and have worked the best for me.  Agreeing with another reviewer_ everyone's body is different and will respond differently to different BC's_ so its all a matter of trial and error with it til you find the one that works best for you.,F,23,4  years,7/19/2008,Desogen

264, 3, Birth Control,moody_vaginal dryness_ yeast infections_ breakthrough bleeding_ decreased sex drive.,This pills works to prevent pregnancy_ but I would not recommend because of the side effects.  Periods are lighter_ but too much breakthrough bleeding.  I took my pill at the same time every night and bled for a month while taking it.  I'm still on it but will discontinue after this month.,F,28,1  years,6/28/2008,Desogen
265, 5, birth control_ acne_ cycle timing,The first month I began taking Desogen_ I experienced a reduction in acne and a slight increase in cup size. Desogyn has given me regular and predictable periods and has greatly reduced cramping and bloating. I experienced very little weight gain and my acne has significantly improved_ almost to the point of disappearing completely. My sex drive was not affected and I highly recommend this product.,Desogen was the first birth control that I tried_ and fortunately_ it turned out to be a prefect fit for my system.,F,17,6  months,6/11/2008,Desogen

268, 1, Birth control,mood swings_ loss of sex drive,"I started taking birth control at 19- now turning 39 I am a lab case example of uncaring doctors and the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. I started taking Desogen at the age of 24 and switched to the cheaper generic brand in the early 90's. I stopped taking Apri last year in April 2006 and have not had a period since then...I will see my doctor this week for an ""annual"" exam.  For years I mentioned to my doctors the low libido and lack of interest in sex. They never made the connection or even implied that possibly the hormone could be the problem. I am still with my husband of 15 years_ but it has been trying for both of us. I recently spoke about a class action lawsuit so no one else has to suffer and be a guinea pig for greedy pharmacy companies.",F,39,15  years,6/8/2008,Desogen
269, 5, birth control,I have taken this pill for 6 years and had no problems with it_ I took the generic Apri most of the time.,My doc just switched me to another pill_ ovcon-35_ because the slightly higher estrogen might help with my hormonal breakouts. I read all the comments about ovcon on here and got scared_ but then the comments for Apri_ which I've had not problems with_ are about the same. So hopefully I'll continue to have good luck. If not_ then I'll come back to Apri. Being female sucks.,F,23,6  years,6/3/2008,Desogen
270, 5, acne_ bc_ lack of estrogen,I've taken desogen in the past and had no noticeable problems with it.  I stopped for a while because I ran out and didnt bother to refill.  Then my acne came back_ and I tried to experiment with other bc's like Triphasil_ Yasmin_ Diane_ and Alesse.  With Yasmin_ I felt literally crazy_ with mood swings and anger.  With Diane_ it was fine for a moment but I started getting frequent headaches and bad mood swings.  Triphasil was great_ but then I discovered that the prog in that bc promotes acne.  So_ I stopped for a long while before considering Desogen.,Its great! I feel like my normal self on this hormone_ no mood swings so i'm not like screaming at my boyfriend for no reason_ and no headaches.  Only thing is sex drive is a little lower than usual_ there are constant food cravings so I eat like crazy_ but I dont seem to be gaining anything_ it hasnt compleely cleared up my acne yet_ but i've only been taking for 1 month so far.  Though I remember back when I took it_ my face cleared up and there was a glow again.  I'm never straying away from this bc again.,F,27,1  months,5/29/2008,Desogen
271, 1, Birth Control,Cramping_ mood swings_ DECREASED SEX DRIVE_ depression_ etc. I just withdrew into myself_ disliked everyone around me.,I would never reccomend this drug to any woman. It makes you feel horrible. It almost ended my relationship with my husband.,F,23,3  months,5/29/2008,Desogen
272, 5, BC/Perimenopausal symptoms,Only POSITIVE ones!!  Clearer complexion_ healthy glow_ softer hair_ lighter/easier periods_ weight lose_ pleasant attitude_ more patient_ happier_ laugh more...,The reason there are sooo many bc pills on the market is because everyones body responds differently.  It is important to find the right match for you.  THIS is it for me_ but if you try it and it's not right for you_ don't knock it_ just try something else.  Simple. Stop hatin',F,44,1  years,5/28/2008Email,Desogen
273, 4, regulate periods and reduce symptom,slight mood swings,Desogen was the best birth control that I have ever taken. It helped clear my skin and I did not experience any side effects except for a slight increse of mood swings(not serious enough to really say it affected me) I just recently tried Yaz which I was very disapointed with and seasonique which gave me serious mood swings and acne and am definitely changing back to desogen. When something works I think stick with it.,F,28,10  years,5/27/2008,Desogen
274, 1, so I don't get pregnant,Lack of energy_ always tired_ increased irritability_ LACK OF SEX DRIVE COMPLETELY!!!! depression_ and lack of appetite.,I used to take ortho-tricyclin lo and I switched over because my gyno recommended it.  I hate it!  My boyfriend and I have been together 2 years and never ONCE have I had a lack of sex drive until I started this_ and now I almost never want to have sex.  I am constantly tired_ whether I get 6 or 16 hrs of sleep a night.. I am never hungry now either..  I won't recommend this to anyone..,F,20,3  months,5/23/2008,Desogen

277, 2, Prevent pregnancy,Severe mood swings_ depression_ no sex drive whatsoever_ no energy_ tired all the time,Desogen made me feel really sad everyday_ I woke up in a bad and depressed feeling mood everyday. I was always tired and never had energy to do anything. I took it for about 3 weeks_ but that was long enough for me to realize how terrible it made me feel. I know that it may effect woman differently but I do not recommend Desogen as a form of Birth Control.,F,21,3  weeks,5/4/2008,Desogen
278, 2, birth control/regulate menstrul cyc,weight gain,I took the generic brand Apri for about two years_ but then Walgreens switched to the generic brand Reclipsen. Though they are supposed to be the same hormonally_ my body had a bad reaction to it. I've gained 6 lbs. in 2 weeks_ which is especially daunting since I've been dieting and exercising to lose weight. I've switched pharmacies just to get back on Apri. The tricky thing about taking hormones is that it really just depends on your body chemistry. Don't be afraid to try different pills/patches/whatever until you find what you like. For me_ Reclipsen significantly lowered my sex drive and caused me to gain weight_ but with Apri there were no side effects.,F,20,2  months,5/2/2008,Desogen

Since I have been taking Desogen_ I have had no side effects except for achy joints and muscles_ which I can totally deal with.  No nausea_ vomiting_ mood swings_ or anything.  I am very leary of taking any kind of medication_ but I am comfortable taking this one and will continue to.,F,24,11  days,4/16/2008Email,Desogen

I went off the Prozac and am still gaining. I think I'm going to stop for a month and see if any weight comes off.,F,29,6  months,4/11/2008,Desogen
283, 5, Birth Control_ Acne,sex drive was NOT affected,I wanted to leave a rating because most of the comments here are negative and I have not had any problems with Desogen.  I made the switch to this brand because it is so cheap and b/c ortho-tricyclen lo caused me horrible cramps which I do not get with Desogen.,F,20,9  months,4/6/2008,Desogen
284, 5, birth control_ excessive body hair,Most symptoms associated with my period have improved with this pill. I have also have experienced a number of other positive side affects.,I have had a very positive experience taking Desogen (I take the generic form - Apri). My doctor originally put me on Desogen due to an increase of fine long hairs which started growing on my chest. This may have been caused by a past eating disorder. I saw immediate improvement with reducing the hair growth when I started taking Desogen. I also noticed a number of other positive side effects including less breakouts_ fewer mood swings_ reduced cramping_ consistent periods_ and reduced anxiety. I have stopped taking Desogen for a few months at a time and have noticed a number of negative side effects when going off of it including hair loss_ increased moodiness_ and anxiety. I have not had hair growth on my chest region return when going off Desogen (though I've not been off it for longer than about 2-3 months at a time).,F,32,7  years,4/5/2008,Desogen
285, 1, Pregnancy Prevention,Vomiting_ sleeplessness_ severe mood swings,I read this whole page before taking Desogen_ and decided to take it anyway. Even though there were so many complaints about the medicine_ I figured people were more likely to leave feedback over bad experiences than good ones.  I was sadly mistaken. I wasn't on Desogen long beofre the severe side effects occured. One night_ I completely lost all comtrol over my emotions. I went from happy to crying_ to angry_ and back again_ over and over. Also_ the next morning_ I dry heaved and vomited. Not too long after the vomiting and mood changes_ I began to not be able to sleep. My whole body felt MISERABLE!! I quickly switch back to my old birth control,F,20, ,3/31/2008,Desogen

I've been on Desogen for 2 months and have experienced severe mood swings.  Last night_ all I could do was cry. I woke up crying_ and haven't been able to stop.  Last month_ I was crazy angry....both to the extreme.  I was NEVER a moody person before taking Desogen.  My sex drive has gone from being pretty high_ to no desire at all!  Kind of defeats the purpose for birth control!  I have an appointment Monday to switch pills! Stay away from Desogen it's the devil!,F,28,2  months,3/6/2008,Desogen

In that time_ Always got period on time_ only lasted about 3 days_ light bleeding_ very little craps_ never got pregnant and never had break through bleeding and was no longer vomited during my periods.  With that said_ I thought it was a miracle drug_ until I went to the ER after 2 days of severe pain under the breast bone when breathing in and pain radiating down my left arm and side.  They found a clot on my lung which can be fatal within minutes of getting one.  I am lucky to be here and thank god.  After reading about desgogen_ it is a 3rd generation pill which puts you at higher risk for blood clots.  I would have given the drug a 5 had I not gotten a clot from it_ since it did everything it was suppose to.  I really don't know what to rate it due to this_ so I gave it a 3,F,28,12  years,3/2/2008,Desogen

I am tired and stressed yes_ but it's due to my school and work schedule. The bleeding is soo much less than with the shot and I am very happy about taking Desogen. Plus it's much cheaper than most other forms of bc_ which for someone on a budget has helped tremendously.,,23,1  months,2/26/2008,Desogen

299, 2, Birth Control,Terrible moodiness_ weight gain_ breast tenderness_ anxiety.,I took Desogen for 4 months after taking Levlen for 3 months.  I switched from Levlen because of the moodiness and breast tenderness I was experiencing.  My bustline went back to normal on the Desogen_ but I was even more anxiety ridden and moody than before_ and still had the weight I put on when I started taking BCP's. After Desogen I switched to Estro-Step_ same thing_ increased moodiness_ anxiety_ depression_ stuff I did not have any time before birth control pills. I'm SICK of feeling like a science experiment with switching BCP brands every 3-4 months_ so I stopped last week after 1 year of switching from 3 brands_ I'm starting to feel like myself again.

306, 5, birth control,I must say I have truly loved Desogen. I did not experience too many negative side effects. I will say that it is great for preventing pregnancy as I have been on this off and on for about 5 years and I have not gotten pregnant as of to date. I will say that Desogen does make your skin very pretty_ and I did not gain any weight that was contributed by this medicine. It was only because I eat. I really love Desogen it has truly benefited me greatly.,I must say that people seem to be rating Desogen low_ however whose to say that these side effects they are experiencing is from Desogen. Could it not be possible that people really do have mood swings due to stress in their life or maybe thats how they really are. OR maybe it is because they are combining other drugs with Sesogen...Just a thought though.,F,24,5  days,1/19/2008,Desogen

For the record_ I have NEVER experienced side effects like I have while on Desogen.  I currently am highly emotional_ short tempered and my road rage is out of control.  I have no energy_ my house is a wreck and I have created a distance between my boyfriend and I that I cant explain.  I recocognize my irrational behavior as it is happening; however_ I cant change the behavior that is predicated on the emotions I am experiencing to change the outcome.  I feel so crazy I cant even stand myself!!!  I am in the middle of my 28 day pill cycle and have decided to discontue this medication immediately.

The nausea has gone away but this pill makes me act like a crazy person. I know I am not acting myself but can't seem to control my mood swings. Small things set me off that wouldn't have bothered me before. I used to be aroused sexually easily but now I have no interest in sex what so ever. I also noticed a change in my appetite.

She was right! I still have migraines but not as frequently! And not at all around the time of my menses either! As far as any side effects? There were a few hormonal adjustments that I had to go through. For the first 2 months_ I had to deal with occasional breast tenderness_ ups and downs (emotionally) and decreased sex drive (not entirely gone_ just not wanting to engage as often). BUT by the start of the 3rd pack_ I was well on my way to being myself again! My breasts still get tender about one and a half weeks before my menses but goes away in a couple days. Mood is pretty consistant (GOOD-BYE PMS!!!!!)_ my sexual interest is right back where it was before starting birth control_ I did not gain any weight. I did however go from a 34C to a 34DD. Which is a bit of a pain for me but my fiance is not complaining,F,27,6  months,12/20/2007Email,Desogen
311, 3, Birth control,Mood swings_ lack of sex drive,Good for treatment of symptoms of endometriosis_ i.e. heavy periods_ horrible cramps_ etc.; however_ complete lack of sex drive kind of defeats the need for birth control!,F,30,300  days,12/19/2007Email,Desogen
312, 4, birth control,Moodiness5-lb weight gain_ about 1/2 dress size,I took this and it worked well--controlled acne_ regular period.  I used to get real emotional on it though: crying_ moody_ etc.  I also gained about 5 pounds on it_ but it was only about a half dress size.  Overall it's OK.,F,20,6  months,12/16/2007,Desogen
313, 1, Birth Control,AWFUL moodiness_ depression_ irritability,This pill is horrible; I only realized that my mood swings_ depression_ and irritability were caused by it once I was off. I felt so much better_ what a relief to know it was this stupid pill & not me!,M,22,7  months,12/16/2007,Desogen
314, 4, Prevent pregnancy,No side effects,Desogen has worked perfectly for me for the past 3 years_ no negative side effects to speak of. It's obvious that birth control pills affect every person differently_ so don't base whether or not you take desogen on people's reviews. The side effects for all birth control pills (and other hormonal birth control methods) are all similar_ especially within the first month or two_ so stick with a brand for a few months before switching. You'll eventually find one that works for you!,F,24,3  years,12/6/2007,Desogen
315, 4, Birth Control,None really i have had maybe two nights where i sweated a little but i could have just been hot!,My boobs have gotten bigger. I have had no problem with emotional spells. I was on ortho tri lo before this and since switching i feel great. No dizziness_ no tiredness_ I think that many women just do not deal well with hormones in their body. Any birth control is going to make you feel different. You are adding something to your body that isn't normally there anybody will react. Life is great i don't feel sick or anxious! I do reccomend this BC pill compared to the others i have tried.(about 4 others),F,21, ,12/4/2007,Desogen
316, 3, Pregnancy prevention_ Severe cramps,HORRIBLE acne_ nausea_ vomiting,I switched to Desogen after being on Depo Provera for 2 years. On Depo I was depressed_ moody_ experienced increased appetite_ decreased sex drive_ all that bad stuff- my boyfriend and I almost didn't last while I was on the shot. Unlike the shot though_ I didn't experience anything remotely close to that on Desogen_ I lost weight_ definitely didn't lose any sex drive_ and didn't experience the severe mood swings or unhappiness- and it was an effective birth control pill. My biggest problem with Desogen was the terrible acne it gave me! I have always had clear skin_ and while taking Desogen_ I started getting horrible_ deep acne all over my cheeks. It went away in two months after stopping Desogen (and that's why I stopped!). My other complaint was that it would make me very nauseated and cause me to vomit sometimes if I didn't go to bed a couple hours after taking it. All birth controls_ however_ are going to react differently to all people_ so you should give Desogen a try if you are,F,22,5  months,12/4/2007Email,Desogen
317, 1, Birth Control,Headaches_ little to no sex drive_ not normal mood swings_ tender breasts_ upset boyfriend.,I really dislike Desigen. I thought it was going to be just like all the other B.C. but noooo. just yesterday_ i had a huge headache and i was just lying on the floor and i would try to get up slowly and the headache would get worse. Then when ever me and my boyfriend would be playing around one minute then all of a sudden he says one small thing and i start crying. He already saying that my moods are really really changing and that i dont have a sex drive any more. I do believe it! That why im going to stop taking them.

318, 5, prevent pregnancy,Weight gain in breasts only_ clear skin NO acne whatsoever_ very regular periods_ mood swings_ bad PMS,Desogen definetly has its pros and cons. Pros- I went from a  32B to a 32 DD :)_ I didn't gain any stomach weight. I have flawless skin and I havent had a pimple for 2 years (the whole time i've been on it). No decrease in sex drive. Very Regular periods. Cons: I have bad mood swings and can be very emmotional. The week before my period I am a wreck! I should be locked in a cage because it makes me a crazy person.,F,18,2  years,11/21/2007,Desogen
319, 1, Prev. Preg./ Cramps,Nausea_ extreme irrational mood swings_ depression_ lethargic_ sudden crying,CONS: I have been on this pill for 2 months now (I was forewarned by my doctor about the severe mood swings it would cause in the first few months) I haven't felt like myself in 2 months_ which is a horrible feeling. I should have switched after the first few days of starting Desogen. I wanted to stick it out. My relationships w/ my boyfriend_ family and friends are suffering severely from my new emotional side. Don't wait it out if you are feeling this way. I should have stopped much sooner. I wish Desogen didnt produce such horrible mood swings. PROS: I like this pill otherwise. My extremely brutal cramps are non-existent and my very heavy 5-day flow is now a very light 4-day flow. I had no decrease in my sex drive_ no weight gain and no skin changes such as acne.,F,30,2  months,11/19/2007,Desogen
320, 5, Lighter period_ prevent pregnancy,NONE,"I've been on this pill about a month_ and the ONLY side effect (if you can even call it that) was that my breasts grew bigger and became rounder. Sometimes I think side effects can be psychological or that people use ""being on the pill"" as an excuse to be bitchy and moody. After reading these reviews I was unsure of whether or not to even start this pill_ but it has been great! I recommend it to everyone!",F,21,1  months,11/16/2007,Desogen
321, 5, prevent pregnancy,none that I know of_ possibly made me more emotional but it's hard to tell because I was a little emotional and anxious prior to going on desogen.,I switched to desogen from mircette because it was cheaper for me. On mircette_ I was pretty much crying constantly for the first 4 months over everything and nothing. Once I switched to desogen_ I was still a little overemotional but it was SIGNIFICANTLY less_ but I'm normally a little moody so it's hard to tell whether it was desogen's fault or not. No acne. No sex drive changes. No cramps or bloating or headache patterns that were different from before_ but I also never had problems with these before going on the pill.,F,22,2  years,11/16/2007,Desogen
322, 4, Birth Control,Lack of sex drive. Breast tenderness.  Slight weight loss.,My doctor started me on desogen after I was having serious break through bleeding on my last pill.  Since starting Desogen I have had no break through bleeding_ and my period comes regularly on the third day of the fourth week and only last three days.  While that's a nice thing to have I have had a serious decrease in my sex drive.  My doctor said that's a common side effect of desogen though and has given me a new pill to try next month.,F,19,4  months,11/7/2007,Desogen

I haven't wanted to do anything. All I have wanted to do is stay home by myself. I would cry for absolutely no reason. My boyfriend broke up with me over the dramatic changes I was experiencing. I lost all my self confidence and self worth. Right when I got off I felt 100% times better. I could even stop taking my anti-depressants I got on to counter act the way this pill made me feel. Don't use it. I am so mad that my gynecologist recommended this pill to me. Trust me_ find something better!,F,19,7  months,11/2/2007,Desogen
326, 2, PMS,depression_ tired ALL THE TIME_ headache_ anxiety,I have been on multiple birth control from the shot_ pills_ IUD. I had emotional side effects from all of them leading me to give up on all birth control with hormones. This is the first year in about 10 years I have been on no hormonal birth control_ once my period regulated I started noticing real bad PMS...I researched and found the problem being PMDD(severe PMS) and I heard that this type of birth control can help with the symptoms from my doctor. I have had pyschological/emotional issues in the past and always thought that birth control was a cause. I am not sure if I'm crazy and the birth control makes me more crazy (still on the search for the answer) but my doctor told me because of the lose dosage_ I should be fine with this birth control. I just started and expected some changes...this weekend I slept more than I have in a long time_ continuous headache_ depressed_ and out of it feeling...I came to work and found this website and think that this pill is the cause AGAIN.

I have always had super clear skin and I now have about ten pimples on my face/back.  I've also never had cramps before and during my period while on Desogen_ I was doubled over in bed the whole time.  I've been getting small nosebleeds a few times a week (I hope I can associate them with the pill?).

I am feeling a bit more emotional and tired (spacey out-of-it feeling) than my usual. I have been a little nauseous. All of which my doctor told me would happen the first few months of taking this pill. I was also informed I would more than likely be on an emotional roller coaster for the first 2-3 months and to warn my boyfriend_ so that he could be supportive and understanding. I came on this site and read most of the comments and got a bit freaked. I am now realizing that DESOGEN_ which is also the same as ORTHO-CEPT (after doing research on the net). I was on ORTHO-CEPT a few years ago and encountered no major troubles_ except for little to no period flow. I am not going to worry about DESOGEN and am going to stick out the first 3 months.

338, 4, Pregnancy prevention_ regulation,Weight loss_ breakthrough bleeding_ spotting,I took Desogen for 3.5 years to prevent pregnancy and to regulate my heavy periods. Instead of taking the placebo pills after the cycle ended_ I would go right to the next pack_ thus eliminating my period altogether. This worked well for me_ since I do get horrible PMS symptoms_ and very heavy and lengthy cycles (lasting anywhere from 7 - 10 days). Also_ it helped me lose the weight that I had gained from taking Ortho-Tri-Cyclen Lo (10 lbs_ shed without an increase in my physical activity or a change in my diet... not too shabby!) However_ the downside to Desogen was that if I missed my pill by 15 (yes_ 15) minutes_ it would cause spotting and breakthrough bleeding until I stopped taking the pill and let my body have a full period. Even when I took the pill at precisely the same time each day_ about every three months I would still get breakthrough bleeding.

I've taken it on and off for the past 5 months and my side effects have been consistent. I immediately noticed I was nauseous within an hour of taking my first pill and that continued throughout my first pack.  The only thing that made that side-effect go away was eating some crackers at the same time I took the pill. My DH was very excited when my bra size increased by almost a full cup size the first month. Unfortunately he also noticed my mood swings and irritability.  Bless his heart for being so understanding!  The most frustrating side effect has been clammy skin with almost constant sweat episodes. I've awakened to find myself drenched with sweat more than I would have imagined.  And it's not just confined to nighttime; I have these same episodes during the day which makes for very uncomfortable situations at work.  And_ lots of dry cleaning bills.

My skin still looks great and my moods are the same.  No change in libido (It was low to begin with_ no increase or decrease now).  My old pill_ Ovcon 35 seemed to plump my boobs up some - just a bit - and I think I might have lost that_ but the difference is quite slight and DH can't notice.  I do notice a weight loss though.

I think some emotional rollercoasters are to be expected when administering any hormonal contraceptive_ but I definitely experienced some of that.

I love the fact that it made my boobs grow a little (am hoping that they will continue to grow)_ I haven't noticed major mood swings though_ but being on different pills for 3 years I actually have never had severe mood swings. I initially got on birth control to clear acne_ the only one that made it worse was Levlen and lutera_ i hated both of those pills. I have had no weight gain_ sometimes my stomach feels upset even when i didnt eat_ but that could be causes by how your supposed to eat something before you take the pill and i never do_ i just take it.

I fear for my relationship with my fiancee!!!  I know I couldnt ever be with out him_ but I'm no longer the happy care free gurl I used to be!!!  I've been crying over the littlest things!  I definitely don't reccomemnd desogen to anyone_ I'm getting off this as soon as I can see my doctor!I've also gained almost 10 pounds_ and even tough my periods are lighter its just not worth it!  I hate putting my friends and family and fiancee_ and even myself through this!  i want myself back!,F,21,5  months,7/18/2007,Desogen
358, 2, Birth Control,Where to begin?...  CONS: severely depressed/mood swings_ enlarged and very sore breasts_ weight gain_ long periods with cramps_ many UTIs_ charlie horses in the middle of the night  PROS: never got pregnant_ sex drive normal_ cleared up acne,Before taking this pill I was a generally stable person emotionally.  I was very happy_ fun to be around and quite optimistic.  Now_ I really don't feel these things to be nearly as constant.  At all.  I'm rather sad all the time.  I cry often_ get irritable with the people I love_ and I know now that I am not so fun to be around.I've just made the connection between this sudden depression and Desogen.  Especially after reading all these reviews_ it's severely evident.  I'm not so sure this one is worth it_ ladies.  Be careful.,F,20,3  days,7/17/2007,Desogen
359, 5, birth control,NONE,I would highly recomment Deosgen. I have been on it for 17 years (recently went off with no side effects) and i have had no side effects and no pregnancy scares. My period came like CLOCKWORK for this entire time!,F,34,17  years,7/16/2007,Desogen
360, 5, birth control_ menstrual cramps,nausea for the first few weeks,The only side effects have been nausea and headaches_ but I don't know for sure if the headaches are caused by this pill. I never get nausea so it must be a side effect that I hope is just temporary. I don't understand people complaining about emotional issues and anxiety...usually I am fairly anxious but since taking this pill I actually find myself to be even more calm and generally happy and positive. I'm glad I didn't let previous comments about depression_ anxiety and bad moods affect my decision to take this pill_ because I feel fine emotionally and physically (except for the nausea).,F,20,28  days,7/15/2007,Desogen

362, 1, Birth Control,Extremely bad mood swings_ irritation_ anxiety,"This pill has screwed up my life! I have been on an emotional roller coaster and horribly depressed. I'm normally a happy-perky kind of person but lately the only person who makes me smile is my boyfriend. A while ago_ I had a complete mental break down and felt everything was completely out of control of my life and mind. At one point I started thinking something was wrong with my relationship with my boyfriend but I got lucky because he knows I've been depressed and won't take me seriously when I'm in one of those ""moods"" which makes me happy because once I'm off the pill for my period everything feels right again and I know I love him and would die if he wasn't in my life. I cry over being at home or for accidentally stepping on my cat in the middle of the night for goodness sake! All this happens when I'm on the pill. When I'm off it for my period (taking the blanks) I'm back to my old self for a week or two. I really don't recomend taking this pill_ it's messed my life u",F,17,1  years,7/9/2007,Desogen
363, 1, Birth Control,DEPRESSION TO THE MAX_ mood swings_ very emotional,This. Pill. Sucks. I'm a girl who has always hated crying and have always been the happy one in the room. When I started taking these pills all of that disappeared. I cry over my boyfriend not being with me even if i know he has other things he needs to do. I feel completely depressed and have been crying all the time. Sure_ desogen keeps my period light and easy to manage_ I haven't gained weight_ and my skin is normal...my boobs i have no clue about...they're just there. All that is fine and dandy but I wont take that over my mental and emotional well-being. I can't handle something like this messing with my mind and life. I'm getting off it as soon as I can.,F,17,1  years,7/9/2007,Desogen

My period now comes on day 4 of week 4 and lasts about 5 days (which is better than the eight-plus days whenever it decided to show up)  Unfortunatly_ my husband complains that I no longer initiate sex (but he ticks me off-that's probobly why)  and once a month I get a headache the day before I start my period.  I get crampy for about an hour or so once during my mensus.,Overall I really liked this med.

This is only my first month still - no break-through bleeding or loss os sex drive thankfully.  But I do feel bloated after whatever size meal I eat.

I wasn't warned about any side effects that this pill may have so I've been on it for a little over a year. When a friend of mine pointed out that my weight gain and depression may be a side effect of the pill_ I decided to look it up online and found this site. I'm incredibly upset with my doctor at this point... this pill messed me up severly.I almost broke up with my fiance_ over NOTHING! I've gained weight and I'm never happy.

So as of yesterday_ I quit. Let's hope I don't get pregnant! I have noticed in the last three months that i feel sane for a week a few days after i start the blanks. So what does that tell me? My insanity is from the pill. I have tried a total of 5 different pills before desogen_ and each one has some wacky mental side effect on me. My doc said some pills bring out underlying medical issues_ and she made me feel like I am crazy. I'd rather have terrible cramps_ nausea_ and swollen breasts than feel mentally unstable all of the time.

383, 3, prevent pregnancy_ and medical,extremely emotional for the first month_ odd sleep patterns_ breakthrough bleedings for over 2 weeks_ nausea_ especially in the morning_ weight gain,I started taking it mainly to help w/ cramps abnormal bleeding_ I had always had extremely bad menstral cramps and had bled for 18 days straight for no known reason which led them to prescribe it to me.  At first I was an emotional mess_ I cryed over movies_ my boyfriend teasing me_ etc_ which is not the norm for me at all.  That did go away after the first month.  I also had weird sleep patterns_ like jerking awake in panic throughout the night_ but waking up feeling great (both NOT normal).  And during this last pack (my 2nd) I bled for 2.5 weeks_ which irritated me since I am taking this to prevent bleeding constantly. I am on my 3rd pack and things should settle in a month or so (my fingers are crossed). As far as preventing cramps the pills are magic_ I think any side effect is better then the pain i would get once a month_ for severe cramps I'd definately recommend!P.S.

I'm not going to warn you against it since the doctors specifically say_ ""You will be an emotional wreck for the 1st couple months."" Just_ warn your partner before taking it that he will have to deal with a different you until your body adjusts to the hormones. My relationship isn't in jeapordy right now simply because I had him read over the side-effects before I took my first pill. The stress is no doubt due to outside factors beyond Desogen. However_ I have noticed an ""I don't care"" attitude that I never let show before. I can usually cover for myself if I'm irritated_ but I now have no problem letting people know they've pissed me off. This is not a good thing to me.I spent a huge portion of the day crying because I couldn't find the extension chord for the vacuum cleaner.

I started taking it because my body wasn't making enough estrogen or something like that.  Basically I didn't have a period at all.  It finally all clicked together when I read these reviews that everything that I was going through is being caused by this medicine.  I'm an emotional mess.  I even cry at tv commercials.  Especially the puppy chow one where the dogs are at the pound and they say that they are good and don't know what they are doing there.  I'm allergic to dogs and just seeing that commerical makes me cry and want to go an adopt a dog.  My relationship with my boyfriend of 5 years is suffering because of my lack of sex drive and my constant mood swings are holding us up from taking the next steps in our relationship.

I know how good I feel mentally and emotionally when I'm off of it compared to how unbalanced I feel while taking it.  I should add that I have tried other pills over the years_ and the Desogen made me feel the LEAST psychotic of them all.  The loss of libido is especially frustrating.  However_ Desogen keeps me from ovulating which eliminates the pain of my polycystic ovaries.  It's a shame that so many of us have to choose between having a sex drive and feeling happy or living with excruciating pain everyday.  I got tired of dealing with the negative side effects_ and I recently stopped taking Desogen.  The positives for this drug are great- it really does its job_ but the negatives have finally outweighed the positives for me. Not to mention the FDA has been petitioned to pull this drug due to the number of bloodclot related deaths linked to the desogestrel in Desogen.,F,30,12  years,4/26/2007,Desogen

Five days after I started taking it_ I had a dizzy spell and lost part of my vision_ followed by a splitting headache. My doctor said I was having ocular migraines and referred me to a neurologist. I had more migraines in the two weeks before I could get into him. He took one look at my medical list and pointed to Desogen and said_ ""This is your problem."" I'm switching again today.On the bright side_ Desogen did leave me completely emotionally stable_ which was great.

404, 1, For birth control,severe depression_ migrains_ long periods_ severe moodswings,Since taking Desogen_ I have become severly depressed to the point that I feel I may need therapy if I don't stop using this bc. It's ruining my relationship and my child is suffering emotionally because of it. I have uncontrolable moodswings that are more often than not aimed at my fiance and at times my son. I may have gained weight but at this point it is the least of my worries. I do not recommend this pill to any one. Also_ my period is very light_ but is lasting about a week and a half.

I have felt the tightness in my chest and all I want to do is eat and go to bed. Obviously I have experienced severe effects due to this bc and wonder will it stop eventually.

Although they usually say it takes about 3 months to get used to a birth control pill_ so I still have hope for that!! Other than that_ pill has been great. I've always had a few pimples here and there_ this pill hasn't cleared them up but hasn't made them worse so I have no complaints there. So far no breast tenderness_ no loss of sex-drive. No sickness. I haven't had a period yet though while on these pills_ its my second pack and I was going on vacation and didn't want to have my period so I took it straight through_ just hoping to have increased breast size after reading through this site!!

I agree with the poster who said it actually made her repulsive to sex.  I wondered if the sex I was having with my husband (of 8 years) was what incest victims felt like--I felt raped_ ""violated_"" degraded by someone I loved and used to struggle not to burst into tears right in the middle of the act for the loathing/indecency I felt. Normally LOVED sex and initiated it quite often before Desogen! Would drive up the road and burst into tears thinking it would be a favor to my husband and child if I died in a car wreck. (Never had mental/psychological issues in my life!) Felt like my life was falling apart and didn't know why. Dark_ dark moods and incredible_ elongated crying spells where I didn't know how to ""go on.""

(I am a very mentally/chemically stable person who doesn't drink or abuse drugs and has no mental illnesses_ etc.)  It affected me and my moods terribly.  Age reflects my age when I took Desogen.

I didn't recognize the symptoms until I stopped. After stopped I was happier_ my periods are lighter_ shorter_ easier (less bloated_ less pain).  My skin is clearer_ and my hair has stopped falling out.   I started the pill right before spending a year abroad_ so I blamed all of my misery on culture shock and homesickness.  I could sort of manage my mood via yoga/diet_ ect.  I also gained 14 Ibs in the past two years.  This past fall I had a lot of issues.  I found I had to eat every few hours or else get horrible headaches and start crying.  I was very cold_ even when noone else felt cold- I would turn bluish and have to cover up with everything I owned to get warm again.  I felt a bit distant_ disconnected_ and even a bit paranoid.

I would bust out crying over small matters_ and really had no control to stop the crying_ the tears just flowed.  Also_ I have experienced extra dry eyes_ noticable when I wear contacts.  My boobs are bigger_ but probably due to a little weight gain.,After the fourth month_ my mood has evened out except for the first day of green pills.  That day I usually cry at least once_ but not during the rest of the month.  I have been eating better and exercising more_ so my weight has dropped slightly.

Had INSANE anger issues the first week_ now am still struggling all the time to stay stable.  The worst_ worst_ worst part is I have a reversed sex drive.  I'm usually a beast_ can't get enough_ and desogen gave me a fear of/repulsion towards sex.  I hate having to decide between the severe make-me-want-to-cry pain of endometriosis and the terrible shame of not being wet_ and wanting to run away every time the man I love more than anything looks at me with desire.,F,23,16  days,11/18/2006,Desogen

514, 1, prevent pregnancy,MOOD SWINGS_ NO sex drive_ nautia_ sleepiness.....,Mood swings!I am angry then depressed then complacent then I'm back to being angry.  It is rare when I feel sane.I have no more sex drive which has NEVER been a problem.  I am constantly sleepy and hungry.  I often feel nautious in the mornings and after eating.  I'm affraid of taking another pill but I think it is time to try.  I haven't taken another form of birth control before but none of my friends have all these problems on what they are taking.  I would rather gain 20 pounds than go through this BS!,F,23,2  years,10/15/2005,Desogen
515, 4, PCOS & birth control,None,This was my first time on birth control. I am happy to report that I didn't gain any weight and I would definitely recommend this pill. Unfortunately_ i was taking it to help with my pcos symptoms such as excessive hair growth. I did not notice any improvement in this regard.,F,23,4  months,10/8/2005,Desogen
516, 2, Pre-IVF,hot flashes_ hyperglycemia,I have PCOS with insulin resistance and desogen raised my blood sugars when other pills have not.,F,27,1  months,9/27/2005,Desogen
517, 3, ,low sex drive_ vaginal dryness,This is the only pill I have thus far tried and I am defintely switching. The pill is good in that I didn't gain weight or get pregnant or expirence any nausea or vomitting. However_ my periods are still heavy_ I get cramps occasionally (albeit less that when not on the pill)_ and there has been no change in my acne. The biggest reason I want to change is the decrease in my sex-drive. What's the point of being on the pill if you don't have sex? It's also starting to have an effect on my relationship.,F,19,4  months,9/25/2005,Desogen
518, 2, Birth Control,Breast Tenderness_ Depression_ Panic Attacks_ Moodiness,This is the first birth control pill I've taken and it made me very depressed at first (which showed as me being mopey.)I went up half a cup size_ which was cool - until I realize I had absolutely no sex drive (I guess it works in more way than one?)Ended up being very irritable_ like 24/7 PMS. Overall NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE,F,20,2  months,9/23/2005,Desogen
519, 5, birth control,slightly nauseous,I have tried many other pills_ and this is the only one that I have liked.  Orthotricyclen made me gain about 10 lbs in 2 weeks_ made me bitchy and moody.  Whats the point of being on birth control if you're fat_ mean_ and crying all the time.  This is the first pill I have been able to take...  I actually have lost weight_ my sex drive is the same_ my periods are light and predictable_ and I don't feel like crying all the time (which I can NOT say for other pills)  Also_ some info for those of you who say there is such a difference between this and Mircette:  there isn't.  They are exactly the same hormones.  Desogen_ Mercilon_ Ortho-cept_ and Mircette are all exactly the same.  Most of these side effects are probably in your head.,F,24,9  months,8/27/2005,Desogen
520, 5, Dysmenorhea_ fibrocystic breasts,None.,I've been on BCP's for nearly 20 years.  I've been on Desogen for 8 years.   This is the first one to have no noticeable side effects.  No breakthrough bleeding_ no breast tenderness_ no weight gain_ no headaches.  I'm on a quarterly cycle to control the fibrocystic breast disease.,F,40,8  years,8/1/2005,Desogen
521, 1, Birth Control/Cramps,Nausea_ headaches_ excessive hunger_ depression_ NO sex drive_ exhaustion,I've been on various bc pills for over 13 years and this is the first to cause major side effects for me. I was sick every day for a month before I found this website and saw that other women were having the same symptoms.  I was getting nauseous anytime I was hungry and experienced TERRIBLE mood swings.  I couldn't seem to eat enough or sleep enough. The final straw was that my sex drive had completely disappeared (this had never been a problem before). I quit taking the pill near the end of my second pack and all symptoms went away within a couple of days.,F,31,2  months,7/20/2005,Desogen
522, 4, Birth control,slight decrease in sex drive_ weight gain and major cramps on my first period on the pill.,This is my first time taking any sort of birth control pills.  I noticed an increase in my appetite and therefore weight gain of about 5lbs.  I think my sex drive has decreased (but this may also be attributed to me reading about how it can lower libido...can be all psychological)  Other than that_ i did notice an increase in my breast size...which i would consider to be a good thing.  No headaches or nausea.,F,22,7  weeks,7/18/2005,Desogen

525, 5, Birth Control/ Regulate Period,Desogen was the second pill that I tried and I didn't experience any side effects on this b.c.,I took Desogen for 5 years and didn't have any side effects.  In fact_ I lost weight while I was on it.  Unfortunately_ I had to stop taking Desogen because after 5 years I started experiencing breakthrough bleeding and my doctor said that sometimes your body changes_ therefore she switched my b.c.  I am on Estrostep now an absolutely hate it.  I don't think I will find another b.c. that I liked as much as Desogen and I've been on 5 different pills now.,F,29,5  years,6/22/2005,Desogen
526, 2, Birth control,Moody_ no sex-drive_ breaking out like never before.,This stuff is crap. I've had my period for a week now and feel like a faucete.

530, 3, birth control,I've been taking desogen for years. Noticed slight weight gain and decreased sex drive in the past. But lately_ on the one week off time I noticed I get very nausious_ migraine headaches_ and my stress level increases enormously. Don't know why but it feels like my body has grown dependant on the drug.,,F,25,6  years,6/2/2005,Desogen
531, 3, painful periods,greatly decreased libido,It made the cramps completely go away and my face cleared up a lot_ which was good_ but even though I'm not sexually active I didn't like having no sex drive so I finally stopped taking it a little less than a year ago. However_ my sex drive still has not improved_ which is odd and has me a little worried_ but I read something that said it can be up to year before your body readjusts to being off the hormones. Also_ about 6 months after stopping it_ my face suddenly broke out worse than it ever has before and my periods became irregular_ among other things. But fortunately the cramps have not returned. But some of this may also have to do with my getting off Paxil about 6 months ago as well.,F,22,4  years,5/20/2005,Desogen
532, 5, birth control_ regulate period,,its great. its the first controceptive i've used and its very helpful. now i always know exactly when my periods are coming and how long it will last. it has decreased menstural (SP?) pain and my period is now lighter and shorter than before.,F,18,2  months,5/17/2005,Desogen

What is up with this freaken drug?,F,37,4  days,5/4/2005Email,Desogen
537, 2, Birth Control/Regulate Period/Acne,Weight gain_ less acne,I was put on this pill because Ortho gave me really bad breast pain and I experienced break through bleeding. HOwever_ the 2nd month of taking Desogen_ I had breakthrough bleeding after taking my pill that I missed just 8 hours after the normal time I take it. I work out a fair amount but never had any problems with my weight. I have gained about 10 lbs since the start of this pill.  I feel like this pill makes me hungry all the time_ even after I just ate. I hate it. I don't have as much acne as I did before but the weight gain isn't worth it.,F,19,5  days,5/4/2005,Desogen

I workout three to four times a week and am fit but I have noticed bloated stomach and bloated arms. Also_ my skin was pretty clear and I only got one pimple right before my period. Now I'm constantly breaking out. Also_ when I first started taking it I noticed a decrease in my sex drive_ but it has increased a little now. The good thing about the pill is it does prevent pregnancy and you do know exactly when you're going to get your period_ but is it worth the bloating moodiness and acne?,F,22,6  days,5/3/2005,Desogen

541, 2, Prevent Pregnancy,slight weight gain_ headache_ NO sex drive_ vaginal dryness_ yeast infection_ breast tenderness_ depression_ bloating_ minor hair loss_ dizzy,The only positive thing I can say about Desogen is that I never got pregnant while taking it. The side effects aren't worth it... My relationship went down hill while I was taking Desogen_ I became very depressed & moody until I stopped taking the pill.,F,23,4  years,5/3/2005,Desogen
542, 5, Birth Control,None,I had to switch from Orthcyclen (after 12 years of use) to Desogen and I was afraid because it contains more of the hormones.  I went online to research opinions and heard so many horror stories that I considered not even trying it.  People said it was the worst pill they tried_ they mentioned incredible depressions and weight gains and a lack of a sex drive and migraines (which I am prone to).  Thank goodness I sent an email to every girl I know and asked about this personal issue.  One girl_ who happens to be my best friend_ I quickly learned was taking Desogen and never had a problem and recommended it.I am now on my third month with it and love it.  No side effects_ none.  And my body is usually very responsive is chemicals in weight gain and my mood has always had fragile issues_ but I have felt sane_ my body hasn't changed and my sex drive is still up and I haven't had a migraine.  I highly recommend Desogen.Also_ I highly recommend against seeking opinions online.  It is usually the people who had a problem with something who seek to tell us others.  I suggest you talk to every girl you know... say it's a personal question and they don't have to answer it but that you may have to make a pill change and are a little scared and would like to know if they have any experience with it.  If I didn't do that I may never have tried Desogen which really seems to be the perfect pill for me.,F,28,2  months,5/2/2005,Desogen

I recently had my gallbladder removed(when I was in pain all the doctors told me I was too young for gallbladder problems).  I have been battling bladder infections on and off since I started taking Desogen_ I had never had one before.
