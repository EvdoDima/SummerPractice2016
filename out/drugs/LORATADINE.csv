0, 5, Hay fever,None,Works well to control sneezing.  I have to take eyedrops (Zaditor) to reduce itchy eyes; loratadine has little effect on itchy eyes.  Seems to be more effective when taken with food.  I take loratadine all year_ not just during warm weather.,M,66,5  years10 mg 1X D,2/19/2013,Loratadine
1, 3, allergies,none that i can really tie back to the pill,For very simple allergies_ like dust allergies_ loratadine works well. Every time I clean my home or move a box_ anything that will disturb dust_ I get a runny nose or start sneezing a bit. I'll pop a loratadine pill and i'm good. But for persistant_ on-going allergies_ or even throat/nose itchiness_ it just doesn't cut it. Was hoping this would replace benedryl since it's non drowsy_ but nope! For longer lasting allergies_ I'll just stick to cold medication.,F,27,3  days10mg 1X D,11/24/2012Email,Loratadine
2, 4, Allergies,None!,I'm so glad this stuff works for me as I can't afford to re-do allergy shots and without something I am miserable.,F,34,5  years10mg 1X D,6/15/2010,Loratadine
