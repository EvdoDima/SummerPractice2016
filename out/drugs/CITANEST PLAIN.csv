1, 5, Wisdom tooth extraction,Typical numbing_ that's all,This anesthetic did NOT cause the typical racing heart and anxiety I feel with novocaine.  It has no epinephrine_ so it takes more to numb you_ but for me it was absolutely worth it. Made this dental experience a breeze!!,F,37,1  days 1X D,2/18/2013Email,Citanest plain
