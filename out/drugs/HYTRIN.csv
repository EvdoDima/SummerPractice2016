0, 4, BP,Dizziness at first_ faded after a few days.  B/P dropped 40 points.  Slow urine stream eased_ much better_ I thought sexual response was odd but some note that_ mine improved by quite a bit.  I am happy thus far,,M,72,30  days5 1X D,5/7/2016Email,Hytrin
1, 3, BPH,Slight dizziness_ reverse ejaculation_ no change either way in libido_ guys_ unexplainable weight gain (6 lbs in 6 mos) and heavy exercise and diet won't take it off (may or may not be related to drug_ but it's a heck of a coincidence). Hair loss_ again possible coincidence.,Some relief from BPH but still having difficulty urinating at night. Burning and slight pain continue; might be having intermittent minor UTIs. Doc says no cancer. Positive effect of drug seems to be wearing off after 6 months. Almost no point in taking it any more. Going to see doc about trying something else. Not a bad drug_ but not a super one either. All I can say is I agree that Hytrin is better than nothing.,M,58,6  months10mg 1X D,9/15/2015Email,Hytrin
2, 4, BPH,Most side effects were brief: stuffy nose_ achy joints. I've noticed a slight increase in libido and erectile performance. Reverse ejaculation continues_ but still get some positive discharge.,Was on Flomax for one day and thought I was having a stroke. Dr. switched me to Hytrin. Took two weeks for any positive effect. It's been 30 days now and have definitely noticed positive effect on urination_ though I can't say I'm back to normal. Some days I pee well_ other days it's more difficult. Hey_ some relief is better than none. Better libido_ less ED_ but still not performing at the level I'd like. All in all this drug has been helpful for me. Give it a try. For me most of the sides went away in a few days and after a month the effect on my BPH has been good. Be patient when you try this drug. It takes a while to work.,M,57,30  days10mg 1X D,4/1/2015,Hytrin

5, 5, BPH & Hypertension,Only noticed side effect was dizziness upon standing.  No sexual side effects at this dosage ever.,After taking this drug for 15 years my BPH took an unexpected bad turn and I was switched to Rapaflo.  I do not like the Rapaflo side effects_ especially on the sexual side.  I am going back to urologist to see if a switch back could be possible,M,53,15  years5mg 1X D,8/26/2012,Hytrin
6, 5, urinary urgency_ increase flow,Slight headache_ some dizzyness when beginning the drug_ orthostatic hypotension.,"Switched from Flomax to Hytrin and thank God I did. Works great_ I can piss like a racehorse again_ have no vertigo at all_ can ejaculate normally again_ and don't have to worry about ""floppy iris syndrome"" as much. Moved from 1 mg. a day to 2mg. after the 1st. week. Side effects flare up briefly when you up the dosage_ then subside in 1 or 2 days. Added benefit of spontaneous ""night boners"" again. Haven't had those in the last 20yrs....!!! Great alpha blocker ...and cheap...!!!",M,57,60  days2 mg 1X D,7/22/2012Email,Hytrin

Slight increase Blood Pressure_ to no increase. No dizzyness.,Took Terazosin generic for Hytrin. Seemed helpful: increased flow_ able to urinate longer. Insomnia on first and second night_ 4 hrs sleep each night. Chills lasting 20-30 minutes when very warm. Though entirely different drugs_ experienced similar side effects with Flomax. If you experience chills_ elevated heart rate_ or significant eye problems STOP USING and call the Dr. May be a good drug if your body can handle it_ mine can't.,M,60,2  days1 mg 1X D,1/22/2011,Hytrin
8, 1, Minor Urinary Incontinence.,Severe diziness_ and spinning sensation all night with first dose.  Second night almost fell down when getting up to urinate and hand to crawl to the bathroom and back to the bed_ 3rd night lightheadache and dizzy_ decided to try accupuncture instead,Not for me!,M,48,3  days 1X D,8/30/2010,Hytrin
9, 3, Hypertension,Growing impotence_ reduced sexual response_ as dosage rose from 2mg through 4mg to 6mg.  Very little and light syncope.,Can't tolerate the side effects I now have.  Original application was for BPH in preparatin for TURP procedure performed last June.  Hypertension increased after the procedure (surprisingly)_ so nephrologist switched uses to this purpose.,M,74,7  months,12/29/2009Email,Hytrin
10, 3, enlarged prostate gland,,,M,68,3  years,11/11/2009,Hytrin
11, 2, Frequent urination,Stuffy nose.  Tiredness.,While it improved my urination issues (frequent visits_ reduced stream_ straining) it made sleep very difficult.  Instead of getting up at night to go to the bathroom_ I was awakened several times from not being able to breath through my nose.  I stopped taking it 1 1/2 ago.  I've just been prescribed Flomax following a Cystoscopy.  I'm concerned I'll have the same symptoms.,M,50,365  days,8/24/2009,Hytrin
12, 3, bph,fatigue,it works well to help with the urination problem_but I have fatigue that may be related to the drug.,M,87,17  years,7/20/2009Email,Hytrin
13, 2, bph_ hypertension,First took it for BPH when I had no hypertension. Side effects of reverse ejaculation and extreme tiredness never went away & I discontinued drug. Later_ when I developed hypertension_ I started on it again and this time was  side effect free for 2 months_ on 5 mg. taken at bedtime. Lowered blood pressure & relieved BPH nicely. Then began experiencing breathing difficulties & pounding heart in late morning_ which would go away after several hours. Lowered dosage to 2.5 mg. Side effects did not gone away_ and BPH relief is unsatisfactory at this dosage.,,M,63,3  months,3/15/2009,Hytrin
14, 5, bph & hypertension,Terrible side effects when taken for BPH alone_ w/o hypertension. Reverse ejaculation; constant fatigue_ even on 1 mg. dose_ even after several weeks. Terrible drug at the time_ had to discontinue it. But later_ when I experienced high blood pressure_ drug lowered it very well and relieved my BPH symptoms_ and I had none of the previous side effects_ even on 5 mg. dose. It became an excellent drug for me.,,M,63,6  months,1/31/2009,Hytrin
15, 4, high blood presure,I think this drug may have caused my hair thining out also when the presure falls suddensly you may feel very weak or in your legs.,,F,62,20  months,10/12/2008,Hytrin
16, 5, BPH,None noticed,Started at 1 mg still at 1 mg symptoms of urine stream stoppage went away within days of begining dosage. No relapse of symptoms.,M,42,6  months,7/20/2008Email,Hytrin
17, 5, BPH,No side effects.  Started at 2mg_ increased to 5mg.  Stream flow increased substantially.  Still get up a couple of times a night_ but this is related to my personal sleep pattern and probaly unrelated to the prostate problem.,Very satisfied with this drug.  Does not CURE the underlying problem (unfortunately)_ but sure makes it more tolerable and avoids the need for surgery (at least thus far),M,68,2  years,6/11/2008,Hytrin
18, 5, BPH,LIGHT HEADED FOR A VERY BRIEF PERIOD.KEEPS MY BP IN THE NORMAL RANGE!,IT HAS WORKED EXCELLENTLY FOR ME.  FROM 3-4 'TRIPS' PER NIGHT TO JUST ONE AND SOMETIMES NONE. LOST SOME EFFECTIVENESS OVER TIME AND NOW USE AVODART AS WELL.  GOOD RESULTS!,M,68,12  years,9/1/2007,Hytrin
19, 4, bph,Too high of a dosage - Weakness_ lethargy_ shoulder pain when bike riding_ very tired after exercising,As I stepped up thro 1mg_ 2mg_ 5mg_ 10mg_ urination kept improving.  My regular prescription was thus 10 mg.  After three months I realized all of the side effects were caused by too low bp (I had normal bp before meds).  I am now at 3 mg.  Urination is still pretty good (but not as good as 10)as I am only getting up once a night vs. 3 or 4 times.  However_ I feel like my old self -- energetic and pain free.  I may move up to 4 mg.  You need to carefully take the time to balance dosage vs low blood pressure.  For me_ I need about two weeks at a particular dosage to fully understand a side effect vs. just a bad day.,M,68,7  months,8/8/2007,Hytrin
20, 4, post brachytherapy - flow/urgency,Initially_ none other than very positive effects of increasing urine stream_ improving volume_ decreasing urgency. On physician's recommendation_ I increased dose and experienced considerable dizziness.  Reduced dose_ added 4x/day Aleve (c.) to help limit inflammation AND things seem fine!,Following brachytherapy (radioactive seed implants within cancerous prostate) the prostate gland (predictably) enlarges_ pressing up against the bladder and constricts the urethra. You get all sorts of urinary symptoms.  I couldn't tolerate the drug of choice for this - Flomax (racing heart_ extreme dizziness) and Hytrin suggested as replacement. So far - results seem good!,M,53,10  days,6/22/2007,Hytrin
21, 4, Enlarged Prostate,None,It definately helps urine flow. If I miss a dose_ I can tell the difference.,M,64,2  years,6/14/2007,Hytrin
22, 1, enlarged prostate,after a few months i had sever lower adominal pain. i could quit taking it and pain would go away. prostrate also would enlarge.,,M,66,6  months,5/9/2007,Hytrin
23, 4, Decreased urine flow; hypertension,Initial dizziness_ but none now,Has been a very effective med for me,M,53,4  months,2/4/2007,Hytrin
24, 4, prostate,Only thing I've found that helps urination. Can't tell of any side effects yet. Been on Hytrin about 6 months. Dosage 4 mg per day.,,M,66,6  months,5/10/2005,Hytrin
25, 3, hypertension,some light headedness at first but that went away after about 2 weeks.,its working.,M,43,7  years,10/19/2004,Hytrin
26, 3, to improve urine void rate,posturial dizziness,Benefit after a few weeks seemed to atrophy gradually back to slow (and incomplete) voiding again. With each increase of dosage_ the pattern seemed to repeat itself although not as quickly as before. Conclusion? Not-so-good with_ but worse without!,M,68,10  years,2/23/2004,Hytrin
27, 4, Enlarged Prostate--BPH,At 5 mg_ blood pressure was lowered to the extent that I fainted.  My Physician reduced dosage--after trial and error --to 4 mg per day. I have reached an equilibrium where blood pressure is low but not to low and BPH symptoms are acceptable.,,M,66, ,12/29/2000,Hytrin
