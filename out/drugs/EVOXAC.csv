0, 5, severe dry mouth,Sweating in head.  Soggy pillow. Nausea went away after 3-4 weeks.,This medication has changed my life.  I sure wish I'd known about it before last year.  Dry mouth caused me to lose two teeth (implants replaced them @ $1800 each).  No more water bottle grabbing either.  Stay hydrated anyway.,F,67,1  days30 mg 4X D,5/31/2016,Evoxac
1, 4, Lupus_ Sjogren's or poss. Sicca,Like so many others --- soggy pillow!  A small price to pay to wake up without the Sahara in my mouth. It was like night and day from the very first dose!,I've been taking this medication for about three years and just in the past few weeks have noticed a return of some of my more painful symptoms (burning in the mouth especially).  I have a pretty severe case as I have already lost 2 teeth due to dryness.  Will check back in with my Rhumy.  I occasionally skip a med or two_ but cannot miss this one --- can feel the difference immediately.,F,66,3  years 3X D,6/26/2015,Evoxac
2, 5, Lupus_ Sjrogens,I have had no serious side effects.,This  drug has done wonders for me. I would highly recommend it. Sometimes I have_access saliva in my mouth_ or pillow. But it's so worth it! No more constantly reaching for a water bottle!,F,26,6  days30 mg,2/7/2015,Evoxac
3, 5, Rheumatoid Arthritis & Sjögrens,Sweating_ excessive urination_ drooly pillows (hah)I really am happy with this little pill! My RA decided to give me a present called Sjögrens_ so my rheumy gave me another. Evoxac. Has worked wonders_ really. 3 times a day and I am good to go. Though I do wake with a wet pillow some mornings!,,F,20,1  years,5/25/2014,Evoxac

5, 4, Sjogrens,The sweating was awful. Somewhat nauseous at first_ but that went away. The medication does work well. It really helped with dry eyes_ mouth_ and sinuses. I am debating whether or not to continue because I am tired of being drenched in sweat all the time.,,F,46,2  months30mg x 2,7/2/2013,Evoxac
6, 3, sjogrens,sweating more,its hit or miss with this drug_ most of the time it did little or nothing at all. I would say it was about 20% effective,M,55,3  months30mg 2X D,5/14/2013Email,Evoxac

9, 5, Dry Mouth,I haven't noticed any major side effects.,The dose was for 3 times a day_ but I have trouble remembering the 3rd dose. 2 times a day seems to do fine for me. It seems funny that I have to take yet another drug to counteract the dry mouth side effect of the drugs I'm already taking,F,53,60  days30 MG 2X D,8/15/2011Email,Evoxac
10, 4, dry mouth_ eyes,maybe increased sweating.,I have taken it for 5 years_ before that I tried Salagen_ but Evoxac works much better for my mouth and eyes.  It really makes a difference as I went without it for a week or so_ and really missed it.,F,61,5  years,8/31/2009,Evoxac
11, 4, Dry mouth,Maybe loss of energy?,I was miserable before taking Evoxac_ about to go crazy from my dry mouth.  I was constantly chewing my tongue or the sides of my mouth.  Evoxac has helped to increase my saliva flow_ for which I am thankful.  I am going to try Salagen to see if it offers greater relief.  I take 30 mg three times a day and chew gum constantly to keep the saliva flowing.,F,55,2  months,6/22/2009,Evoxac
12, 1, Sjigruns,I started with a quater dose every  hours and was ok_ except heartburn.  When I took a three quaters dose I was natious_ dizzy_cramps_ and felt out if it.  It added a little moisture but not the gushes I have heard about.,Some folks say the nausea goes away after a week but I also had dark stools and wonder if it is an allergic response,F,50,2  days,3/22/2009,Evoxac
13, 4, Sjogrens,So far_side effects have been minimal_ but I have only been taking it for less than two weeks.  I was told to take 3 times per day but only take in am and pm.,Has tremendously helped my dry mouth and even my eyes.  I had completely forgotten what is was like to actually feel my own mouth produce saliva! What a relief!,F,51,10  days,9/16/2008,Evoxac

16, 5, Sjogren's Syndrome,I haven't had any side effects.,I take one Evoxac in the morning and one at night_ and have for the past 7 years.  It's interesting to read about the side effects that others experience.  All it's ever given me is relief.  The only complaint I would have is that it's so expensive.,F,66,7  years,3/16/2008,Evoxac
17, 5, Sjogrens Syndrome,Sweating.  I'm having abdominal pain and doctor thinks it may be the Evoxac,Has improved my quality of life greatly.  Would not want to be without it.  My mouth was miserably dry before,F,52,6  months,2/6/2008,Evoxac

19, 4, Sjogren's Syndrome,Excessive sweating is a side effect that I have experienced.  At times the excessive sweating is unbearable. My hair gets so wet that it looks as though I have just jumped out of the shower  and the sweat soaks through all of the layers of the clothing I am wearing.  Due to the amount of water I lose through sweating_ I have to be very careful about my water intake. I have found that I need to drink lot of water or I become light-headed.,This drug has been helpful in treating the dry mouth I experience.  It has not been very helpful in relieving dry eye symptoms.  I was taking it 3-4 times a day when first prescribed but I have reduced the frequency to twice a day.  This has helped to decrease the frequency of excessive sweating episodes.,F,54,3  years,11/16/2007Email,Evoxac
20, 3, Sjogren's,Sweating,Evoxac has tremendously helped with migraines. Unfortunately it only works temporarily for the Sjogren's. Approximately 30 minutes after injesting the pill_ I begin to feel sweat on my back and stomach. It typically last about 45 min - 1 hour and then it's over...until my next pill. It has not helped with my eyes or joints.,F,32,2  months,10/19/2007,Evoxac

I would not be able to function without the relief that evoxac provides!,F,49,2  years,7/7/2006,Evoxac

I hurt so much I couldn't even move.,It did what it was supposed to do for my skin_ eyes_ and dryness in the mouth.  I stopped having the body slam pains after I quit taking Evoxac.,F,59,6  months,6/21/2006Email,Evoxac
24, 4, Dry mouth_difficulty swallowing.,I have not noticed any side effects from this medication.
