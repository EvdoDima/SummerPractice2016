0, 3, back injury from fall off a ladder,very sleepy; viscious heartburn unless taken DURING a meal and pain does not subside depending on time of day I take it,Pharmacist told me to take one with breakfast and one with dinner. If I forgot the one at breakfast I took only one that day with lunch - pain did not subside. I have healed enough after 30ndays now to take one a day with dinner. I do not like this drug in the am because it makes me so sleepy and rather loopy - not alert. This drug gave me the worst heartburn unless I took it with a meal like this: eat a little - take the pill - finish the meal. Also I needed to drink two full glasses of water it order not to feel dehydrated because I am also on two other meds. Mostly though I was disappointed with the pain relieving value of this drug: even when I took it as directed the first week I was still in pain. The pharmacist told me to give it at least five days of strict adherence to dosing at regular times. I got more relief from this drug after 5 days than I did from an OTC one like Aleve. But I don't know what it would have been like had I taken Aleve regularly for 5 days. Just not real happy with this drug's effectiveness initially.,F,56,1  months400mg 2X D,5/14/2014,Etodolac
