0, 5, Eczema,a few stretch marks,This is probably the best drug for eczema there is.  I have tried most of the drugs out there for atopic eczema and this one worked the best.  Protopic and Elidel sucked and didn't do anything for me...all they did was make my skin burn like hell and my clothes greasy.  Other than taking the right medicine_ the REAL solution to eczema is find out what foods or environmental factors are triggering the outbreaks and stopping them.  A scratch test from an allergist did wonders in finding out that I was allergic to dust_ smoke_ milk_ dogs_ cats_ and many other things.  A majority of doctors (especially HMO) won't tell you this secret information because they want to keep you suffering so they and the drug companies keep making money off of you.  Do not use this medicine on your face_ around your armpits_ or inner thighs---use a milder steroid for those areas like over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream.,M,31,2  years,12/7/2007,Topicort
