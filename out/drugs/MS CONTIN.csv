1, 5, Spine C2-C7_ L3-5s1_car accident,Just Constpation.(can manage)  No Drug Cravings due to long acting_ slow release of meds.,This medicine gave me my life back! When you are so debilitated by Pain that u can't move_ u want to Die_ At least the Pain would be done in Death. No More Surgery would help_ but  My Doctor helped me get relief. I'm so sick of Drug addicts taking Narcotics and killing themselves. Then Docs getting blamed_ The meds get blamed & patients R questioned to Y we R in Pain in the First place! Not everyone who takes pain meds is abusing them! If A Diabetic took 2 much insulin_ or a patient w/ HBP OD' on their meds due to not following prescribing orders_ is it the Docs fault? It's no different for Pain meds.  If a Doctor prescribes medicine it's up to the Patients to take it as prescribed. Y should we SUFFER w/ Pain? Labor pain was nothing compared to what I feel without my meds. I can't imagine not being allowed to take my medicine it scares me more than anything_ and not because I want to get high_ but because I want relief & to be a Mother & a Wife_ not a perpetual bedridden patient! Patients who don't abuse their meds & have a true medical problem need to unite together! How can we do this? Our story needs to be told!!!,F,36,7  years200mgx2,6/2/2016Email,Ms contin
2, 5, L4_ L5_ S1_L/R knees shattered,Dry mouthMild nausea which would happen for 20 min every few hours which i believe was the tablet teleasing more medication. Eased after a day or two.For withdrawals get immodium ad or any lopermide otc. Take equivalent dose as you would an opiate(do not need more then 20mg once per 24 hours. I take 10 2mg once a day).

Do not sit back..doctors are under the gun from government and drug seekers. We as a group have to push and push hard both medically and politically. Research_ understand and take your future back from the decisions of big business and government. Doctors want to help us but there are rules. Review the medication and not your personal opinions of your doctors. No help get up walk out. It took me 13 years to find someone to help. They are out there.

8, 3, 3x back surgery/bulging docs c-t,I've never had any except constipation_ which helped with the use of a stool softener such as colace.,I do go through a pain clinic which has very strict rules. They control a patients_ use to prevent over use of opioid medication.. The pain clinic I use only will prescribe ER medication. The problem most ppl like myself run into are periods of break through pain which _ in that situation_ your basically stuck. There are other pain clinics that prescribe differently_ it depends on the MD and they all vary state to state.I've had several lumbar back surgeries and have many bulging discs from my cervical to lumbar spine_ I live with severe pain pain everyday. I'm currently exploring my opinions with a new pain clinic to better control my pain now that I'm getting older and my spine problems are getting worse. The use of MS Contin greatly helped in the beginning_ but_ with long term use_ the drug no longer provided the pain relief it did in the beginning_  you will notice the effect will not last as long as when 1st prescribed. All in all_ MS Contin is definitely a great drug for many_ my suggestion is find a pain clinic and work closely with you MD_ and convey the severity/describe in detail your pain.,F,51,2  years15x2d/30x1,10/1/2015,Ms contin

15, 3, SLE RA UC,Tired. Extremely Tired. Insufficient pain relief.,I've been in pain management since age 10. I have mixed connective tissue disease. At age 10 I was prescribed Demerol and Dilaudid. Compared to Oxycodone MS Contin will make you have half of the energy and half of the pain relief however you'll sleep better. In fact you may be so tired you wonder why you even bother taking the medication as pain management goal is to give you some form of your life back. I guess minor pain relief is better than none but I'd really like to be able to get out of bed once in awhile. I hope it works for others in chronic pain.,F,34,2  years60MG x 6,12/5/2014,Ms contin

Yes I have long hair_ and I am eccentric_ but do not use any recreational drugs. Finally_ through a caring nurse friend I found a doctor who was appalled at my previous treatment and gave me MS Contin. I live a reasonably normal life now. Management is important. Each month I reduce my dose to 1 x 60mg per day taken at 10am. Yes I get the flu symptoms and some unpleasant side effects for the 2 to 3 days_ but when I get back to the normal dose the effect is dramatic and I have my energy back. It takes management. Constipation is a definite but can be ameliorated easily. I take one teaspoon of Nu-Lax (contains senna_ pears_ apricot_ figs_ dates_ sucrose and glucose and is a very natural laxative) Also two glasses of Metamucil per day. Pleasant taste_ orange or other fruit flavours which will work as a stool softener. I do recommend putting up with the 'cleansing' procedure once a month to flush out the excess morphine.

I have herniated disc disorder with sciatica (which is radiating/shooting pains down my legs_ usually the left one).  I've got severe nerve damage in my legs due to the jelly from the ruptured discs adding too much pressure on my spinal cord.  MS Contin works even more effectively with Chitosan supplements.  Google it - I speak the truth_ from experience.  I prefer ENDO generics_ because they seem to release a bit faster.  Mallinkradt (sp?) are annoying because they take FOREVER to kick in but once they do_ they're fine.

46, 5, Back injury,Itching_ constipation_ confusion (at times),My doctor's decision to prescribe MS Contin is the best advice I have gotten in the 20+ years I have dealt with my back problems.I have had a total of 10 surgeries and more are necessary. However_ I have no intention of letting them touch me again. Though I'm only 41_ I am considered disabled and receiving benefits_ I am relatively comfortable and happy. Mainly due to the introduction of MS Contin to my life. Like many I have read_ I was doing oxycontin with dilaudid breakthrough. This went on for about 18 months leaving me with an obvious addiction that began to disrupt everything in my life. With the unbelievable help of my doctor_ whom I owe everything to_ I was able to stop the oxy/dilaudid Hell after a year or so with the use of MSC. After six yrs_ I am maintaining on 150/180mgs daily and leading a pretty normal life. Sure_ I have horrible days. However they are greatly improved from how it was.

Mild acne again_ slight itching.,"I was on Oxycontin 40mg 3X a day for the last 2 years and thought it was great.  Little did I know how much different my life would be on MS Contin.  (Plus it is SO much cheaper!).  My husband cannot get over how calm I am.  He describes it as on oxy_ there was always a level of tension/possible emotional eruption lurking_ but with MSC_ I am mellow as can be.  Very happy_ he says the ""old me"" is back_ more chatty_ happier_ overall mood enhancement.  I never realized oxy had done that to me - after years_ we forget our former personalities_ I guess.  I was taken off oxy abruptly due to severe side effects that came on suddenly_ so I am being titrated up slowly on the MSContin.  I am going every 2 weeks until my dose is settled.  I am hoping this dose will be ""it"" - 100mg 3 X a day.  I take Percocet 10/325 up to 3 a day for breakthrough meds as needed.  I am very glad to have gotten the ""oxycontin"" burden out of my life - hated ever having to tell any docs_ any ER_ any pharmacy because of the stigma.

48, 4, Severe sciatica_ Radiculopathy,Initially I became constipated,"I sustained a nursing injury while trying to save a patient. I felt horrible burning up and down my buttocks. I was in PT 5x per week. I got no relief and was finally put on percocet and it did nothing. I became bedbound from pain. I saw a pain psychologist because I became suicidal from intense unbearable pain. I lost my job and lost my home. A psychiatrist evaluated me and asked a pain specialist to put me on morphine. My life was forever changed that day because for the first time in a year I was going to finally get some relief. The medication allows me to function without pain and I have been asked if I ""feel high"" and the answer is NO! I feel as though the medication allows me to think and function without chronic debilitating pain. I never did go back to nursing because a nurse can not work under the influence of narcotics. A light-duty nurse does not work because they are considered a liability. My pain psych informed me that without pain management I most likely would have resorted to suicide.

49, 3, multi-level disc disease,SEVERE Anorexia_ which continues up to today. I began taking MS Contin 30 mg tablet every 12 hours_ and Roxicodone 15 mg tablet / 5 per day_ in March of 2010. I really do not know if one_ or both_ of these opiates_ is the problem.,MS Contin 100 mg tablet every 12 hours_ plus Roxicodone 15 mg tablet / 5 per day_ plus Promethazine HCL 25 mg tablet prn_ has helped alleviate my pain somewhat. But I still must be very-careful how I move_ walk_ and do other simple things_ like standing to wash dishes; roll-over in bed; etc.---the simple movements of body which most people take for granted. This back pain is HELL!!! In short_ this present medication regimen does not work real well for me. I just began receiving the 100 mg MS Contin tablets 8 days ago_ increased from 60 mg tablet every 12 hours. I really think I need my Roxicodone 15 mg tablets / 5 per day_ increased to 30 mg Roxicodone tablets_ but I am concerned my doctor_ who is a very helpful and understanding man_ might flip on me_ and cut me off. I should add_ that my back damage was caused_ by my being thrown out of the back of a 54 foot shipping van_ when a tractor jerked the van from under me_ throwing me to the concrete warehouse floor_ on October 07_ 2009---I have a lawyer. I have real problems_ and I am really afraid of my doctor thinking I am playing him_ for a legal high---which I am not_ as my January 2010 CAT Scan is plain proof of my problems. Have any of you suffered with the SEVERE Anorexia_ nausea_ and diarrhea problems_ especially the Anorexia? Anyone who has had the Anorexia and lack of analgesia problem(s) got a winning LEGAL drug combination for me to suggest to my doctor?

I find that if I take 2 doses at once_ I get the relief I used to.

That being said_ 15mg of MS Contin 2x daily seems to do the job very well in alleviating the pain.  There has been no addiction.  In fact it went the opposite way: she gave it up easily and had no withdrawal symptoms.  But the pain returned with an awful vengeance two days later.  Moral of the story (that prescribing Dr. never told us): you must take it steadily_ don't go on and off without supervision.

97, 3, severe back pain from car accident,I seem to have lucked out compared to some folks. I was not sleepy_ felt quite energetic_ and my pain was controlled fairly well with 60mg MS Contin with 15mg IR. The high dosages are simply because I am naturally opioid tolerant_ which some folks just are. I had a mild histamine reaction_ i.e._ I felt a little itchy sometimes and wanted to pick at myself a bit. Taking Benadryl will address this_ but the added sleepiness might be too much for folks that are made drowsy by the morphine itself. I honestly liked the combination of fentanyl patches and Norco for breakthrough better_ but my doctor wanted to switch me around to a variety of things in order to help reduce tolerance issues.Incidentally_ when my pain allowed it_ I've withdrawn three times_ once each from MS Contin_ fentanyl/Norco_ and Dilaudid. Yes_ I was very ill_ but I did it with a full bottle of medication right there next to the trash can I was puking into. Don't be afraid of tolerance_ it doesn't equal addiction.

I used to as well_ until I started going to one specific Target pharmacist_ to whom I introduced myself. Considering that _now_ I'm actually on maximum doses of both Dilaudid and Norco_ as well as Valium for muscle spasm and strong amphetamine ADD medication_ he has plenty of reason to look at me cross-eyed. Yet he does not_ because I simply took the time to tell him what had happened to me_ and invited him to call my two doctors. Which he did_ and they told him that I was not a problem patient. Now he treats me like a special customer_ gracious_ helpful_ always making sure he has my meds in stock when he knows I'll be coming in (the ADD medication I'm on is so rare I'm the only person he's ever met that's on it).

They have no idea how much pain I'm in and how every day of my life is full of incredibly pain_ frustration_ anger about the pain and things like that. Having said that it makes me sound like a horrible person to be around_ but I'm normally quite pleasant because after 13 years of going through this_ I've learned to hide it well for the sake of my wife and kids.

135, 5, double amputee-multiple surgeries,some constipation,Very effective for pain control. I have taken every pain medication there is and this has helped control the pain the best.  I take 2 60mg. pills 3x a day.  However_ I need to find an effective med. for the break thru pain.  I have had over 30 surgeries on my legs-first trying to save them and for the past 4 years trying to fix the damage caused by the disease that led to them being amputated.  Doctors want to amputate more of my legs-they think it will help the pain.  But with the ms contin_ my pain is under control and I am able to walk on prosthetic legs.  I refuse to let them take any more of my legs.  With the ms contin I am able to live a fairly normal life and be a good wife and mother to my family.  I also have a wonderful pharmacist who understands the battle I have gone through in trying to seek pain relief and he never gives me any hassle.

I could function on the Oxycontin and no one even knew I was on any pain meds. I have been on this for 2 weeks and I hate it_ I feel like a zombie and don`t get out of bed expect to go to the bathroom which is very hard to do either one.

L-1 is gone_ replaced by titainiuim. Be very careful on your next ascent on a ladder. Try not to be over asphalt. Anyway...I've preety much been through the mill. You've been there or heard it before. Oxycontin and Dilaudid are probably the the best for pain relief_ but despite my best intentions_ I couldn't help abusing them. They do a good job with the pain and they make you feel really good-(well being) I would find that chewing my 80mg pills every 6 hours was better than swallowing them. After a while_ I never swallowed them. I forced myself to ask the doc for something else. (after 7 years!) He gave me MS-contin 60mg 3X day with 30mg 4X day for breakthru. I feel so much better. A little peri-colace relieves the constipation. That's the only side effect I have. I never chew them-brand is definetly better then generic. I don't have any real high to speak of.

147, 5, 7-hern. discs. degen. disc disease,I took MS Contin for almost a full year before I decicded to take myself off of it due to the side effevts that were causing problems in my marriage. It completely took my sex drive away. It also caused me to strike out at my wife and pick up a domestic violence charge. I only threw a pillow at her_ and chose to only throw a pillow rather than pick the chair up I was sitting and slam her with that. This is something that I am very ashamed of. This is something that I NEVER would have done otherwise. It had to be  the morephine that made me react like that.As for the pain relief_ it was wonderful and worked very good. I started taking two 30 mg twice a day_ and went to three a day. I slept like a baby_ not having to wake up during the nigh to take more of other types of pain meds as I know have to do. I'm currently taking Lortab 10's and find myself taking more than the perscribed 8 per day. I'm in pain_ and feel alot more pain which really limits me as to what I can do in any given day. I am a Viet Nam Vet. Airborne Ranger Special Forces_ and jumping from the airplanes has really taken a toll on my back and on my knees. It never really bothered me until around two years ago_ and it all came out of the blue around the age of 50. My pain is so severe_ sometimes I don't think that I can take it any more. It really takes alot of pain for me to even complain_ but I'm doing alot of complaining now. Especially since I've taken myself off of the MS Contin. I really feel worthless and sometimes wonder why I sholdn't put a bullet through my head to end the pain_ suffering and discomfort. I really went through some seriuos withdrawals but I'm considering going back on it just to relieve more of this chronic pain. I'm having a hard time weighing out the pro's and con's. I could use a little help with making this decision so if anyone could send some thoughts my way_ It would really be appreciated.,The MS CONTIN really helped with the chronic and severe pain_ but...I'm a serious advocate for doestic violence and don't ever want to harm my wife and_ or children. I'm also a retired pro-fighter and could really hurt someone. And that I don't want to do.

So she took me off the morphine IR and gave me good old hydrocodone.

I see him Monday so we will see.As far as the pharmacies_ you do get looks but who cares. Nobody knows how much pain you are in so tell them to stick it.

Going to a Pain Management Center to start a round of Epidural Steroid shots to try and put off back fushion surgery as long as possible. I have a VERY difficult time taking pills of any kind without gagging and vomiting. But I liked that the pills were tiny and alot easier to take. However_ that said_ I could not sleep last night_ had problems breathing which I believe was due to panic attacks. I was very worried about taking morphine_ and read all the side effects that could occur and just went into panic mode. But Hydrocodeine just doesn't help me. It only messes with my head.

156, 4, Chronic Low back pain,Contipation,I have suffered for years from low back pain and was hard to find a Dr. to take me serious. I even had to quit my job as a CNA in a nursing home due to my pain. Was so frustrating that nobody would take it serious. I'm glad to say I finally found a Dr. that would take my pain serious come to find out that I really need back surgery for my deterorating spine_ but I'm scared and really can't afford the time off from work to recover. So_ we experimented with a few different combos. She started me on percocet  5/325 and Oxy IR 5mg. That combo didn't help too much although I found the Oxy IR very addicting and was easy to take more than I should. I was glad to get off those. She then switched me to Avinza 60mg once a day w/ percocet for the break thru. Those helped somewhat but didn't find them to last the 24 hrs they were supposed to plus I had a extremely hard time getting them filled so now I'm on MS Contin 60mg 2x's a day w/ percocet for break thru and I'm finding them easier to be filled(generic). I do have to agree with the ones on here about getting funny looks from some of the pharmacists. Most ppl don't understand that we take these for our pain_ not to get high and taking them for pain you DON'T get high from them. I function a normal basis now that I take these_ although I think I need to be uppped on my dosage and the withdrawls from this is horrible I had to go 2 weeks without it and it was the most excruciating 2 weeks ever!

164, 5, Neck Nerve damage/ severe pain-head,Well I do get constipated_ & since I take MORE than the prescribed dosage & crush & swallow them I have alot of energy & have a hard time sleeping.,This is a marvelous pain med! I've taken so many different opiate analgesic meds over the yrs this is the best i've found for long term relief! The way I take them & the amount lasts me all day long til I sleep! Because I have other opioids to prevent wd's I usually take between 4 to 6 30 mgs(Endo or Malinkrodt)tabs daily & I do what you're not supposed to & crush & swallow them with Coca-Cola which nakes them take effect faster! I've been on Dilaudid(every mg & even used to take them when they were prescribed in grains & were soluable! Remember those beauties?:)& almost every Oxycodone & Hydrocodone there is & even Fentanyl & Demerol & other synthetic pain meds made_ as well as meds now discontinued like Pantapon/others. I've used to be on on 75mg Methadone daily for over 10 years at a clinic(& would often buy more from other patients of the clinic illegally up to 200mgs daily!) but had to get off basically cold turkey in a hospital setting where I was only given 25 mgs Demerol for the 1st week(then decreasing amounts) to detox_ then only Catapres(a hi blood pressure med that somewhat helps the wd's)& benzo's & sleeping pills to detox the rest of the way! IT WAS HELL! So I finally found a considerate Dr. who(after trying many other pain meds)gave me the MS-C_ but altho i've been on my supposedly normal dose for 4 yrs I need more but he won't prescribe a higher dose_ so I take more than I should. This is an efective med for pain & I don't know what i'd do w/o it! I've been on opiates for over 30 years. Most of them for recreational use for most of that time but when I developed my REAL pain problems at age 46 I began the MS-C at age 48 & have been on them ever since& it's worked wonders. As I said I do get other opiods(mostly Oxycodone or Hydro's)which keep me from having withdrawals. I just pray i'm never taken off this med unless a cure is found which i'm told will never happen so....I'm very happy now & mostly pain free & pray I stay that way! I'm glad I found ONE Dr.(out of approximately 30 I saw 1st who wouldn't prescribe anything stronger than Vicodin-Narcos-Percocet-ect. or even Darvocet or Tynelol #4 which is like taking a placebo!)who had the knowledge & compassion to give these MS-C's to me & the otherfast acting pain meds as well....THANKS Doc! If you need a great pain medication that lasts long term Morphine Sulfate ER(MS-Contin Extended Release)& has little side effects(for me)I highly reccomend you 'try' MS-C! Btw_ I recentlyfractured my radial & ulna bones in my forearm/wrist & when taken to the ER they 1st gave me Morphine IV which didn't work at all because of my tolerance to it_ & the kind ER Dr. immediately gave me IV Dilaudid in 4 mg injections(16 mgs in total in a 6 hr period)& this almost completely took my excruciating pain away. SO IF you are on MS-C & ever have a serious pain related injury_ I suggest you be truthful & tell them you've been on a strong analgesic to allow them to treat you with a pain med that will work for you. I had NO IDEA(after my yrs of recreational opiate use)how much i'd need these types of very potent pain meds for REAL pain_ & I now belong to many msgbrds for people w/Chronic pain & sympathize with the 10's or 100's of thousands of people whom suffer REAL PAIN & have trouble finding a Dr. WILLING to prescribe the neccessary opiates for relief!!

168, 4, Severe RLS / Neuropathy,Awful constipation.  I don't experience any euphoria_ dizziness_ sleepiness_ etc.  This is a nice change from my first regimine of Klonopin and Oxycodone.,MS Contin has positively changed my quality of life.  My neuropathy / restless legs was so severe_ I often couldn't get out of bed all day long - and I was only 30 y.o. at that time.  My first doc had me on 5/350 mg oxycodone 5x a day and Klonopin.  That often knocked me out completely - with extreme daytime fatigue. And the ups and downs of oxycodone was awful - it worked fast and wore off fast_ with a terrible rebound effect.  MS Contin is so different_ but you need to take a STEADY regimine - find what's effective and stick to it.  I take 60 mg in the morning and at bedtime and one .5 mg Xanax at bedtime - I've been nearly symptom-free doing this.  The pain is almost gone_ and so are the muscle twitches.  I sometimes have breakthrough pain_ but it's only moderate.  Also_ MS Contin works best to prevent pain_ instead of as a cure. So_ take it BEFORE onset of symptoms.  The only negative side effect I've noticed is horrible constipation.  But I've discovered mineral oil!  Only_ don't take mineral oil within a few hours of your MS Contin dose or it could lessen the efficacy.,M,33,18  months,8/4/2004,Ms contin

175, 4, pain relief related to pancreatitis,Side effects were few beyond dreaded cycles of lethargy_ constipation and diahrrea..oh my! but it's better than the pain I'd otherwise be experiencing fully!,Good pain reliever_ doesn't really relieve all the pain_ but makes life livable..one 30mg (sometimes 2) pill is ok if I can swallow it and keep it down; just started to use 15mg immediate release form (under the tongue) for breakthru pain and the combo seems pretty stable and helps with chronic pain from pancreatitis and I can generally tolerate most medications well..have had few side effects from any but efficacy of MS CONTIN is tops! I have tried a lot of pain meds_ this one gave best relief with fewest side effects.. Am currently also taking Pheneragan for occasional nausea (rectally) and sometimes lomotil for runs.  When efficacy of MS CONTIN starts to wane; in lieu of increasing dosage; i switch for a month or two to Duragesic patches (not usually in summer)and then back.,M,40,24  years,4/23/2004,Ms contin
176, 4, To get high,relaxing_ warm_ soft_ fuzzy glow,Eating these things wastes it and takes too long to kick in. I found if I ate an entire 60mg pill I would get less of an effect than snorting 10mg of it....weird but true. I think alot of the medication is wasted in your stomach lining. very addictive and not a high like oxy's but less intense. Worth a try but better to shoot it up. Won't go there though.,M,36,3  months,4/3/2004,Ms contin

178, 4, Lower Back Pain_ Degenerative Disc,severe constipation_ increase sweating_ major drowsiness_ can't drive while on this med_ frequent feelings of needing to urinate but bladder not full_ occasional uncontrolled muscle jerking of arms(about 4 times a month)_makes me sleep a lot_ sometimes sleep happens immediatly while on med and I wake up 30 min or so later not realizing that I had fallen asleep. If you are a smoker_ DO NOT SMOKE IN BED while on this med. I have several burn holes from falling asleep in my bedding. VERY DANGEROUS! Have also burned my fingers from cigarette burning all the way down.,While the side effects limit what I can do in my personal life_ I feel I wouldn't be here without this med. My pain is so severe I had thoughts of suicide prior to being placed on this med. For me it was a life saver_ I can function now and walk some_ where before I was bed ridden. Have also tried OxyContin_ I feel this is a superior medication but can't afford the price of pills. $800 for a rx of 100 tablets. I now have insurance but my insurance won't pay for OxyContin because of the price and negative press about med. They are both effective for severe pain. I felt OxyContin had less side effects when I was on it. I take 300mg MS Contin (generic) 2x daily and 30 mg MSIR (generic) for breakthrough as needed_ up to 8 per day. A high dose but have built up a tolerance to pain meds_ Have been on pain meds for 5 years. This dose has been stable for me for the last 8 months.,M,40,8  months,3/20/2004,Ms contin
179, 3, Back Pain,Other than constapation none,I have went from hydrodone 10 mg 3 times a day to Oxy IR 5 mg 2 pills 3x a day for 30 mg a day. Then my regualr Dr got sick and the backup Dr put me on MS-Contin 30 mg 2 a day. They dont last 12 hours they are not as effective as the Oxy or Hydrocodne was.My last visit I told them they dont last 12 hours so they added 10 mg hydrocodone 1 a day to the mix. This has taken care of the problem for the most part. But I think that 40 mg of hydrocodone a day would work as well with less constipation and much more cost effective. Perdue Pharma wraps a little extender around the meds and charges out the yeng yang for them. I have been on these types of pain meds for about 4 years. I also take large doses of NSAIDs.I think that I was able to function better and felt better all around taking the Hydrocodne or OXY.The Hydrodone is a lot less hassle as well can be refilled not treated like a drug addict at pharmacy etc..,M,40,6  months,1/31/2004,Ms contin
180, 4, migraines,very very tired and sorta hungry but maybe it was just me,dont take this if u are a young teenager and be careful and dont drive!! But if u suffer from pain this is a good thing to take but it will ruin the rest of ur day by knockin you out. If you cant take the pain that you have you should take this to get rid of it but dont take it too often cuz it could become habitual because once you take this medicine alot some of the other stuff you take starts to not work as well.,F,17,1  years,9/26/2003,Ms contin
181, 5, Multiple Back Surgurys/Chronic Pain,Some dizziness_ occasional sweating_ and constipation.,MS Contin is an excellent pain reliever; I take three 60 mg tabs four times daily.  I additionally take 1-3 Norco 10/325 four times daily for breakthrough pain. For severe muscle spasms I take three Valium 10mg as needed. Anyone who is plagued with constipation from their meds_ there is an all NATURAL MIRACLE available (FLAX SEED OIL) from your local health food store. In addition PLEASE eat a common sense diet and make sure to take a variety of water soluble vitamins and minerals. I've done so for 10+ years and when my Dr. tests my liver/kidney and other organs he just cannot understand how my tests return so positively HEALTHY!!,M,39,10  years,8/26/2003Email,Ms contin

184, 5, lupus_ degenerative disc disease_,constipation_ sweating_ MS Contin 60_ then 80_ then 100 all taken for one month each at 3 times a day that is every 8 hours_ helped but still had acute break through pain_ now starting MS Contin 100 3 times a day with MS IR 30 mgs twice a day for break-thru pain.  SWEATING. Can walk better_ still feel the pain but can move better. NEED multiple joint replacements.  No cartiledge left.,OK_ but there is prejudice from some professionals like pharmicsts at Newark Delaware ACME pharmacy_ they said they do not have it_ do not stock it would not fill it. Told me to go next door_ and that pharmacy had me wait 30 minutes to then tell me they did not have it.  One month while on the 80 mg only had to wait 5 hours_ leave and return to a Maryland's Kleins grocery pharmacy as the pharmacist wanted to check and recheck with the doctor and insurance company.  I am a pleasant_ normal looking individual with above average education and income. A graduate degree_ married 17 years to same person.  Did not deserve bad treatment.,F,49,4  months,4/15/2003,Ms contin

190, 4, spinal cord injury+fbs,nausea in beginning_ constipation_ sleepiness after just taking_most side effects went away after several weeks.,Have taken since 1990 - have had to change dosages quite frequently - now on 90mgs every 6 hours plus 45 mgs of MSIR every8 hours. Also Percocet for breakthrough pain.  Now my doctor is suggesting I change to Methadone. Kind of afraid to mess with something that at least works a little - in exchange for the unknown. Very afraid the methadone will not work as well.,F,50,12  years,1/11/2003Email,Ms contin
