0, 1, Insomnia,May as well not take anything. Some nights it would take 30 minutes to feel effects_ others it would take 2 hours. When I did feel effects_ it didn't make me tired; just dizzy and uncoordinated (if I don't manage to fall asleep right away_ that feeling dissipates within about 45 minutes). After 5 hours of sleep_ I awake without fail and can't fall back asleep.To compare_ last year_ I took 1mg brand name Lunesta for about 2 months_ and it worked strong and fast (,If you like the brand name version and it works for you_ I don't recommend switching to generic_ unless you need to save money.,F,30,35  days3 MG 1X D,4/2/2015Email,Eszopiclone
