0, 1, couldn't sleep after my mother's death,I took halcion to stop nightmares/anxiety after my mom's death.i quickly started abusing them to cope.i was taking them all day long and losing huge chunks of time.i was taking 6-8 (0.25) tablets at a time and would be standing talking one minute and keel over out cold the next.im shocked I didn't die.i hit my head on the bathroom counter passing out once.i got pregnant with my daughter (and when I found out there can be missing digits and limbs from this medication...I quit cold turkey.i didn't sleep for 2 weeks.But I never took them again.and my daughter was perfect because I did the right thing.I think this medication has a huge abuse risk and everyone should be really careful with it.,,F,26,1  months0.25 /pm,4/5/2016Email,Halcion
1, 2, Insomnia,Severe nightmares_ continued insomnia_ amnesia and depression.,Didn't help for my insomnia at all_ I slept for maybe 1-2hhrs on it_ and that was if had been up for a couple days already. So I got a total of 4-6hrs of sleep every week.,M,18,1  months0.375 1X D,3/21/2016,Halcion
2, 5, Dental surgery,Grogginess_ some amnesia.,Took one tablet the night before surgery and it helped me sleep. Took two tablets an hour before surgery and it worked great. I was relaxed and groggy during surgery.  Don't drive. Someone needs to take you to and from appointment.,F,60,2  days.25 mg 1X D,1/25/2016,Halcion
3, 5, Tooth extraction and uncovering,Nausea_ dizziness_ stumbling,Felt like really hard core drowsy medicine_ but I puked about 15 minutes after taking it. Luckily_ I didn't puke up the meds. It did make me a big goofball. I was laughing at everything. I enjoyed my experience over all. I basically knocked the heck out and don't remember much. I had that plus Nitrus oxide plus novacaine for my procedure. If you feel nauseous_ tell your doctor! Mine gave me some Zofran and I was good to go,F,18,1  days0.25,1/14/2016,Halcion

5, 5, anxiety_nerves_sleep,no side effects,I was given this drug originally for sleep. I discovered that it improved my mood and calmed me down. I then asked my Dr. for additional doses that I could take during the day and he agreed with the caveat that if called upon would I testify what it has done for me. I would still be taking it for the fact that I lost my job and insurance. Now my health care has been taken over by the V.A. and it's impossible to get from them as they dont listen to patient's who want to be involved in their treatment. Now I am back to square one and suffering while being prescribed drugs that have a minimal effect on my well being.,M,65,10  years.25 4X D,9/23/2015Email,Halcion

I couldn't tell you what happened 15 mins after that. It was great - my gf would prob say otherwise as she said I mumbled and stumbled around but it was very effective.

I must have the worlds largest tolerence because I felt nothing. Not even tired.  I was told I can take too.  Nothing.  So I took two again.  And nothing.

15, 1, to create amnesia for dental proced,the amnesia failed- I became aware of bait & switch_ my surgery was very invasive- not as advertised.   My dentist left himself vulnerable to my knowing what occurred and quickly dismissed me as a patient.,The amnesia is now an integral part of multiple surgeries in one day at the dentist-  We are sold Halcion to erase the process -  for the dentist's own comfort.  So the process can be hidden and accepted.,F,52,1  days5.0 MG + 5X D,7/17/2014Email,Halcion

17, 1, Dental sedation,"extremely anxious about dental work. nothing ever seems to help. had tried .25 mg last appt_ and it did nothing. Dr doubled dose to .50 night before_ and morning of procedure. I had not slept in 2 days_ so was looking forward to having this help me sleep the night before my dental work. didn't help much - but was able to get about 3 hours sleep. took the morning dose about an hour before procedure. It was awful :( the pain was excruciating due to novacaine not working properly (hence the reason of my dental anxiety - novacaine doesn't work well_ and when it does_ it wears off fast)....however_ I physically could not say ""hey! STOP!!!""  all I could do was feel the tears streaming down my face. Never AGAIN will I take this medication. I was completely trapped and now my dental anxiety has increased 3 fold :'(  It also did nothing to cause the ""amnesia"" effect I keep reading about.

21, 5, Sedation for dentist appt.,N/A,I was very satisfied with this medication. I took .25 MG the evening before my dental appointment and .5 MG an hour before. I had six hours of dental work done and remember very little of it. I honestly didn't feel like I was in the chair for more than an hour or so_ and I definitely didn't care about whatever the dentist was doing in my mouth. I definitely recommend this for others with dental anxiety!,F,27,2  days.5 1X D,11/1/2012,Halcion

26, 3, Dental Procedure/Anxiety,Nausea & vomiting,"I was prescribed .25mg Halcion to take 1 hr prior to my dental procedure.  I had never take it before_ and am quite petite and was somewhat worried about the effects.  It made me ""cloudy"" and a bit dizzy_ but there was no memory loss as everyone says_ and you are fully aware of what is going on around you.  It made me vomit once at the dentist's office and then once again when I arrived home.  The nausea lasted on & off throughout the day.  I did take a little nap_ couple hours_ and woke up fine and without having that hangover feeling.  I have chosen not to use it again_ due to the nausea_ and can tolerate dental procedures without it.",F,37, .25mg 1X D,4/19/2011,Halcion
27, 2, Dentist Appt Sedation,Dizziness and vertigo.,This was prescribed to my 8 year old for dental sedation_ and although it made him loopy and dizzy it was exceptionally ineffective.  The purpose was to relieve anxiety and prevent traumatization and memory for my son- the meds did not work_ he remembers the entire procedure and was EXTREMELY traumatized by the entire situation.,M,8,1  days 1X O,11/10/2010,Halcion
28, 4, dental anxiety,short-term amnesia; slightly unpredictable effectiveness. Make the assumption that you will be confused and require supervision for 4-6 hours after taken if using as an anti-anxiety.,"While I am not thrilled about having a 4-hour-long ""hole"" in my memory_ I had been unable to go to the dentist for a couple years over anxiety. With halcion_ I was able to sit through two sessions each lasting a little under two hours of drilling and such. I have vague memories of the dental work being done_ but they are only fragments_ and don't cause me the kind of anxiety that will keep me from finishing up the work I need done. It's a reasonable trade-off for me.",M,47,3  times 1X AN,10/2/2010,Halcion
29, 5, Insomnia,None,Works faster than the Restoril I was taking_ but wears off faster so I wake up feeling much more rested. When I take Restoril to sleep I alway feel so tired the next day.

32, 1, 1 hr pre-op dental surgery,Was told to take this by my oral surgeon as I would have no pain & no memory of the procedure. Per oral surgeon_ I had severe agitation within 1 hour of ingestion_ inability to sit still. Complete memory loss_ inability to walk correctly x 1 day. Slept for 5 hours after getting home. No known etiology-not due to drug interactions. Had never taken this drug before. I would never recommend it to any patient_ although it is now widely used in dental practices. Per pharmacist_ a certain % of patients who do not have psych hx_ depression_ or hx of alcohol use will have a poor outcome with this medication. Patients become zombies_ no memory_ no conscious control of actions. This is a sedative-hypnotic. Per FDA warnings: Serious side effects of SEDATIVE-HYPNOTICS include:getting out of bed while not being fully awake and do an activity that you do not know you are doing. (See What is the most important information I should know about SEDATIVEHYPNOTICS?)abnor,Ask for another medication-this is not the only drug that is available for patient anesthesia_ which is basically what it was used for in my case.,M,45,1  times,1/7/2010,Halcion

34, 1, 1 hr prior to dental appt,uncontrolled laughing_ feet/legs giving out (falling down) & extreme tiredness,I showed no anxiety nor had any at the prior day's dental appt. Why this was prescribed is beyond me but I will not be using that dentist again. They told me it would relax me & that I would be able to care for my 1 1/2 yr old son afterward. Needless to say_ my mother had to help me to bed and take care of my son.,F,20,1  days,8/13/2009,Halcion

36, 1, prescribed on admission to hospital,extreme paranoia_ complete loss of short term memory_ poor judgment,I was admitted to hospital for OCD-related suicidal depression and the doc put me on antidepressants (clomipramine/anafranil) which was successful_ xanax_ and 1mg of halcion every night! Already at that time (1984) there were warnings about halcion and this dose was way too high_ yet he kept me on it for 7 years! Even though I reported to him things like I refused to touch my pen after someone borrowed it because I thought he had poisoned it_ that I lay down in the road at night for a rest_ etc. He only showed concern when I told him I did an assignment and only when I put it in my folder did I realize I'd already done it before_ exactly the same like a photocopy! That's when I quit it. I never needed it anyway as I had xanax to get to sleep. No wonder it's been used as a date rape drug and also murder charges have been dropped against people when the judge found out they were on halcion!,M,62,7  years,3/10/2009,Halcion
37, 5, Severe insomnia,Absolutely none.,I suffer from severe insomnia_ I would be up for 4 to 5 days at a time. I have tried all types of sleep agents and Halcion is the only one that has been effective thus far.,F,36,5  months,1/16/2009,Halcion
38, 2, Insomnia,Emotional instability.,I took this a few times because I'd been waking up during the night and not able to go back to sleep. Since the effect is short-lived this was prescribed. Almost every time after I took it_ the following day I would get extremely emotional about insignificant things_ to the point of crying uncontrollably.,F,34,5  days,1/15/2009,Halcion
39, 3, Sleeping aid,I have taken Halcion only a few times in the past 15 years.  I have always loved it because I am very sensitive to medications and with this I was able to sleep great and still feel great in the morning.  However_ I recently took it about 3 months after having a PTSD type reaction to Versed and it triggered the reaction again.  I slept great the night I took it but it has been 4 nights since then and I wake up at 1:00 AM experiencing severe panic and can't sleep for the rest of the night because I feel like I'm going crazy.  Literally every muscle in my body feels like its buzzing and my heart it racing and pounding.  It is very scary.  I have never had this reaction to Halcion before_ but I feel exactly like I did for about 2 weeks after being given Versed.  I am now afraid to take it again.,,F,47,1  days,12/2/2008,Halcion
40, 4, Insomnia,If i took over the recommended dose I still had hangover. But with the recommended Dr dosage I slept very well with no problems at all.,Regardless of the negative publicity halcion had years ago. It taken as directed it really does help you sleep with no problems. Plus is comes generic.,M,48,4  days,7/26/2008,Halcion

43, 4, insomnia,When I took it responsibly there were no side effects.  When I was an idiot and took to many I almost killed myself in a car accident.,This is the only sleep medication I have ever taken that has not caused drowsiness the next morning_ and it works almost nightly.  The bad thing is that the half life is around 4hrs. I think you will either love or hate this drug.  It is unlike any other sleep aid I have had.  Take it responsibly though as it is a potent drug.,M,42,2  years,8/2/2007,Halcion
44, 3, insomnia,none,Sometimes it helps me sleep; sometimes I stay awake all night.,F,35,2  weeks,7/29/2007,Halcion
45, 2, resistant insomnia,When I tried Halcioln it was a disaster. I couldn't fall alseep_ so ikept taking tablets every half hour (like you're never done it)_ and_ while feeling normal and awake_ apparently I fell asleep_ and then woke up half an hour later swaddled in couch blankets not know where I was or how I got there.,Halcion either takes a VERY long time or a very large dose to kick in for some people (I'm pretty drug resistant) but no pharmacy in the US will actually give you a reasable dose. I don't remember having any induced nightmares (possibly because I was asleep for souc a short time)_ so I suppose that's a plus_ but I'm not willing to put up with that sort of disorientation unless there's a benefit.,F,25,2  days,11/10/2006,Halcion
46, 1, Insomnia,Although the 25 mg Halcion had a relaxing effect I was wide awake for 4 hours and then decided to take another half tab. Slept fitfully at best.  Next day I was so confused and sleepy that I could not drive safely and spent a good portion of the day in a drowsy state but unable to sleep.,I have taken this medication some time ago and remember the lingering drowsiness. Both times I have been on SRI anti-depressants simultaneously.,M,62,1  days,4/15/2006,Halcion

48, 5, Sleep Aid,Perfect restful sleep.  Rapid,Took it off an on for 4 years to help adjust to rotating day/night work shifts.  Extremely refreshing sleep with full alertness and energy upon awakening.  Ambien does not get you to sleep as rapidly nor as well as Halcion and Ambien leaves you very groggy upon awakening by comparison. Too bad irresponsible patients made the med nearly impossible to get any more.,F,43,4  years,5/18/2005,Halcion
49, 1, to control anxiety,Psychosis.,The psychiatrist_ not knowing (or caring?) that I had been taking Haldol and Halcion_ informed my parents that I was psychotic and should be institutionalized (?!). Thank God my Mom obtained both MRI and CAT scan results to prove those people wrong. There is a possibility that these drugs will worsen any kidney problems that you may have [or that you  may not be aware of at the time :(]. Therefore_ I strongly recommend to find out as much as you can about the medicine(s)_ and to have your physician test other medications before agreeing to take either Haldol or Halcion.,F,36,1.5  months,2/8/2005,Halcion
