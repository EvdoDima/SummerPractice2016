1, 3, Fungal infection on big toe nail,Extreme tiredness. Regular bloating sometimes extreme. (Never experienced stomach complaints previously) Occasional irritability. Heightened general anxiety. Unusual muscular and joint aches. Find usual exercise regime sometimes impossible sometimes possible with extreme exertion. Last time I exercised I had what I believe was a tension headache_ very sudden very painful. Had to walk 4 miles back! Aside from these issues the poison seems to be resulting in unaffected nail. My opinion is get the nail cut off its not worth the hell.,,M,32,7  weeks250,8/7/2016,Lamisil
2, 4, Toenail fungus and skin fungus,Very little side effects.  Very slight upset stomach...almost unnoticeable.,I'm on month 5.5 out of 6 and no problems.  I was very worried about taking this medication but my dermatologist was not.  He was right.  Unless you have a history of liver problems in your family you should go ahead and take this drug.  It started killing the toenail fungus at around 2-3 months_ so my doctor put me on it for a total of 6 months.  The worst thing about it is...you will need a blood test almost every month...and this is mucho expensive if you don't have coverage.  The medicine itself is only about $75 per month_ and that is if you have no insurance.  Don't be afraid of it...go ahead and take it...and if you somehow are one of the minority who who has problems just stop the medication and tell your doctor_ there are other medications he can give you to kill toenail fungus_ but Lamisil is the most effective.  By the way I also had a fungal rash on my hand (what a big issue this was for years) and the Lamisil started killing it after only a month.  The toenails took longer.,M,51,6  months1 pill 1X D,7/15/2016Email,Lamisil

I don't have any side affects_ and have fought this for 8 yrs_ spent 2 yrs at a poditrist who gave me a nail polish to kill the fungus and religiously for 2 yrs did this with no change.   my toes have a long way to go_ they do not appear as thick_  they look like they are clearing up_ they dont look that disgusting any more...  i am going to go thru the 90 day treatment_ I just pray I don't get these horrible side affects some of you all talk about_ but I feel fine_ if not better!

23, 1, toenail fungus,Never been sicker in my life. Extreme fatigue_ nausea_ dizziness_ constant headache_ reflux_ total lack of appetite. Unable to concentrate. All of this_ all day_ every day. Like the worst hangover +flu at the same time.,"This stuff is poison for me: it has compromised every single aspect of my life. Since blood tests have been normal_ none of the Drs I've seen have picked up on the side effects & have called it ""hormonal"" (!). Discontinued it immediately upon realizing it's been Lamisil & not lead poisoning or a brain tumor or mononucleosis or Lyme disease (all of which I've considered as possibilities_ never having had side effects to anything remotely like this). It is POISON. Yes_ it kills the fungus but I have paid for it with my sense of taste_ my ability to function as a wife and mom_ interest in family_ friends_ and life. Had to take time off from job-unable to work w/fatigue & nausea. Went from being a triathlete to being unable to walk dog around the block in 2 months. I hope to God I will be able to get my old life back. This has been a NIGHTMARE.",F,49,85  days250 1X D,3/15/2016Email,Lamisil
24, 3, Nail fungus,Mouth sores_ depression_ anxiety_ fatigue_ joint pain.,I have tried everything else for this very embarrassing nail fungus_ so I am trying to tough it out and complete the course of therapy. I begged my MD for years to let me try it when nothing else worked. I don't want to have to take anti-depressants_ and when I told him about the anxiety_ he didn't want to give me anything for it. It says not to drink alcohol_ but there isn't any other way to sleep. Taking 15-20mg melatonin_ 4-6 unisom_ and 5-8 calms forte a night to be able to sleep 4 hrs. Back pain so bad_ I stay on a heating pad on my days off all day. Halfway through lamisil therapy. Just have to try to tough it out!,F,48,10  weeks250 mg,3/12/2016Email,Lamisil
25, 2, Skin infection,Anxiety_ OCD-like symptoms_ tight feeling in chest_ loss of appetite_ feelings of worthlessness,A couple of days after taking Terbinafine I began feeling extremely low and down_ unlike myself_ and had feelings of worthlessness and depression. Then the intrusive_ OCD-like thoughts_ began; very distressing and made it difficult to focus on anything. Also experienced a tight restricting feeling in the chest. Even after I have stopped taking the medication the intrusive thoughts and anxiety persist - do not take this if you are vulnerable to anxiety or depression!,F,17,10  days250mg 1X D,2/13/2016,Lamisil

28, 1, Toenail Fungus,Dizziness_ loss of appetite_ dry mouth_ insomnia_ fatigue_ diarrhea_ tremors_ anxiety_ depression,First couple of days were okay. I experienced a little dizziness and a slight loss of appetite. If I forced myself to eat when I took the pill the dizziness went away. Third day I began to experience some slight anxiety. The anxiety increased on the fourth day. I began questioning my relationship with my boyfriend (whom I love dearly). Thought it might be hormonal. The fifth day I woke up with diarrhea and severe dry mouth (I've probably drank a couple gallons of water today and am peeing like crazy because of it. Probably good to get it out of my system quicker). Throughout the day I experienced a lot more anxiety. Tonight I became very depressed and even contemplated suicide to get away from the sudden and confusing anxiety and depression. Had to call my mother to come sit with me in my apartment so I wouldn't hurt myself. I've struggled with anxiety here and there (nothing severe)_ but this is unlike anything I've ever felt. I made the connection to Lamisil when I stumbled on this site. I'm not going to continue taking the medication! Currently I'm experiencing terrible insomnia. It's now 1:30 AM and I haven't eaten for 12 hours because I can't keep anything down/I have no appetite. It's too early to tell if the medicine is doing anything for my toes. Even if it did_ I'd rather have nasty toenails than crippling depression or any of the other horrific side effects! I do not recommend this drug!!,F,21,5  days1x/d,1/18/2016,Lamisil

On top of that I also started getting panick attacks/ anxiety/ rapid heartbeat. All and all I was just miserable. I stopped taking the meds and we are now about 2 months further and I'm still trying to heal my digestive tract. The diarrhea is gone_ I do still have soft stools and I can't eat wheat/gluten etc any longer. My stomach wakes me up in the middle of the night because of loud rumbling.....

Since the medication didn't work the first time the next year they put me on it again for 90 days the first two weeks the panic attack started again and I started to investigate on the internet and found that is one of the main symptoms is anxiety and panic attacks I would not recommend it for anyone that suffers from depression or ending mental illness or even normal people I live a normal life and then in fear for the last two weeks of my life and didn't know why.

I went to see my GP_ she thought I might have rose river virus_ malaria or dengue fever. The tests came back negative_ but I had elevated white blood cells for no reason. My GP prescribed antibiotics and some pain killers. She had no idea about the lamisil side effects niether did I! Then after sixths week_ one night_ I woke up in a very bad mood and suddenly felt really anxious_ my heart rate went to may be 180. I went back to my GP_ she thought it's due stress_ then she asked me whether I still take those pills_ I said yes. Then she searched online and she said actually those pills (lamisil) have some side effects and one of those is anexiety!!!! Then myself_ I came here to see what are the side effects_ now I realized what happened. All these problems suddenly came up due to this horrible lamisil. I still have three weeks to go and won't give up until I finish them_ as my toe nails are growing back nicely.

No other side effects at all.,I read about possible side effects before taking it_ so I decided to start the medication by taking half a tablet for 4 days_ taken at bedtime. The side effects can be somewhat bothersome at times_ but I can already see improvement so it's worth it to me. I would NOT suggest pulling it off the market as others have suggested. Reactions are different in different people. I can only say I am mostly happy with Lamisil as I have not finished the full course of treatment.,F,69,2  months250 mg,12/16/2015,Lamisil

38, 5, Fungal skin rash and toenails,Loss of appetite_ slight nausea_ headaches_ exacerbation of depression and anxiety symptoms.,"I just have to say that I've read a lot of the reviews_ and all of the other reviewers are unfairly giving this medication a bad review because they didn't like the side effects. No medication in the world is going to be free of side effects_ and if you were a well informed patient and not only discussed the medicine with your doctor but read the info that you were given by the pharmacy then none of these would come as a surprise to you. Stop blaming a ""bad"" doctor or ""bad"" medication for your willful ignorance and refusal to educate yourself about what you put into your body. Also_ none of you seem to know how to follow basic instructions_ as none that I've seen have correctly put in their dosage info. Makes me wonder how any of you were bright enough to even submit a review_ as your reading comprehension skills and basic common sense seem to bee missing with most of you.",F,32,3  weeks250 mg,10/15/2015,Lamisil

My sleep is interrupted by waking all night and I ache all over.,I would never take this drug again!  My toenail hasn't changed.

49, 1, Ringworm & toenail fungus,Chest tightness_ muscle aches_ joint pain_ headache_ nausea_ anxiety_ lightheadedness_ sore throat.,I took this drug for six of the 30 days it was prescribed and on the morning of the sixth day I felt a tightness in my chest.  It emanated from the center of the chest and spread half way to each shoulder.  I stopped taking the medication on day six.  Following the chest tightness I experienced a tender area on the front of my forehead that resulted in headaches.  The upper part of my left arm had sporadic aches and I experienced joint pain in the left elbow.  Lightheadedness and dizziness followed on the second day after stopping the med.  I called the dermatologist's office and the nurse recommended to stop taking the drug (duh) and when I asked about the chest tightness she said it should go away that day.  It didn't.  I visited my regular doctor and reported the chest pain_ numbness in the arm_ and headaches.  He ran lab work for kidneys and liver and administered an EKG.  The tests were normal.  It has been four days since I stopped the medication and the symptoms persist.  I read an article online that suggested the medication remains in the system for 200-400 hours after the last dose.  I am hoping for some relief over the next two weeks.  I will NEVER take this medication again and if anyone asks me about it I will deliver a resounding NO.  RUN.  Find another course of treatment.

52, 1, Foot rash,Anxiety and severe depression. Dry mouth and bad taste in mouth.,I have struggled with anxiety for the past year and about 4 days after starting oral terbinafine my anxiety started increasing. On the 11 th day I started feeling this dark_ hopeless feeling. I have had small bouts of depression in the past but never anything like this. I also had this preoccupation with suicidal thoughts. It wasn't until I took the last of my 14 pills that I decided to look at the side effects. Sure enough_ changes in mood_ and anxiety and depression are right there. Then I found this site and am seeing that other people have experienced a very similar situation. I took my last dose about 36 hours ago and am still having extreme symptoms.

But_I am at the 60 day mark and I'm stopping this drug.  I was supposed to take it for 80 days_ but the issues with my taste buds are scaring the heck out of me.

My tongue was sore as if I had scalding burns and the papillae was all red_ enlarged_ and inflamed. It became difficult to eat and drink or simply concentrate_ as it hurt so bad.

Was going well until the 7th week when I started to lose my taste.  Didn't realize right away it was from this and ended up taking it for another 2 weeks on and off.  Then started noticing that after taking it my tongue and lips began tingling and were numb.  Been off it now for about a week and the tip of my tongue is still somewhat numb and tingling; still have a dry mouth_ and have altered taste.  Everything takes on a somewhat salty taste.  It's horrible!  From what I've read_ appears to take a very long time for things to return to normal.  Hopefully they will!  Would NOT recommend this drug to anyone!  The only upside is that my toenail fungus has definitely improved.  Hopefully I had enough meds to clear it up.

71, 1, toenail fungus on one toe,After taking this medicine for exactly one month_ I too experienced the significant change in my taste buds. For two weeks_ everything I ate or drank tasted like salty motor oil. AWFUL!! These side effects eventually subsided and then I lost my sense of taste all together. Chocolate cake tasted the same as broccoli -- and it all tasted like cardboard. Again_ AWFUL. All told_ I lived in misery for 8 weeks without being able to enjoy food at all. After two months_ my taste slowly began to return to normal. It's been ten weeks since I first experienced these horrible side effects. I am happy that I am now able to enjoy food again -- but only savory foods at this point. Desserts/sweets/sugar still taste awful -- and chocolate is the worst. I'm hopeful that I will be able to enjoy these foods again soon. I have lost a total of 11 pounds during this ordeal. I would gladly add back those 11 pounds and have fully functioning taste buds.

74, 1, Toe nail,I was only on Lamisil for 2 days. I had heard about this drug years ago but was apprehensive to take it because it can possibly be hard on your liver. I thought I'd give it a go as the nurse at the foot doctors office encouraged me to take it. So I thought okay maybe it's okay_ well I picked up my script and read all the side effects. The first day it seemed like I just swallow the pill and about 30 min after got upset stomach and diarrhea. Then later that day started getting a sore in my mouth. Day 2 worse diarrhea and then on my way to work my throat started to get sore and felt some swelling on one side. Before I got to work called the doc office and reported my side effects. I was told to stop the meds. When I came home from work I found this site and read everyone's comments. I felt the same as many of you that it was poisonous. I could not handle any more than 2 damn days. I will continue to try natural remidies. I agree with everyone that it wasn't worth it. I know for a small amount of people they had no problems. And I know this sounds ridiculous but_ I too was starting to feel negative and depressed!!!!,,F,59,2  days250 mg,3/19/2015,Lamisil

I had every side effect mentioned and I read about the side effects AFTER taking this med.  Won't do that again!  I am glad that I am better_ but side effects are still ongoing_ and it seems like this drug leaves your system very very slowly...I have tried to find info on this drug online and DermNet NZ has info that it binds to proteins in your blood and is slowly eliminated from the urine and feces.  I am healthy_ 5'3 and 108lbs_ and always have exercised. I also had lost about 10 pounds being on this stuff since I could not eat_ no appetite and nauseous and loss of taste (taste came back after about 6 weeks).  I am back to normal weight_ but there are no words to describe this med...NIGHTMARE sums it up for me.  I think this med is poison and it is beyond me why they so readily prescribe it like handing out candy.  Should be a 'last resort' drug.  I am on Jublia now and that is a topical treatment that seems to work.  On a very short side note...I will say my nails actually were clearing up. ""I almost died_ but my nails look goodThanks Lamisil!"" SO NOT WORTH IT_ I just pray my life returns to the state it was before I took this med.

77, 1, Fingernail fungus,God I will try to keep this as short as possible.  Lamisil is a horrible drug.  I have been off of it for 6 months and I am still having side effects.  I have to laugh at the RNs that write in and other people who swear everyone on here is crazy because we are experiencing horrific effects.  Everyone is different.  I have NEVER had side effects from any medication like I have/had with Lamisil.  Horrible.  I swear I have been through hell and back the last 6 months of my life.  I wish I could turn back time and NEVER have started taking it.  I was on the medicine 14 days_ my mouth started tingling...I broke out in a rash on my face (cheeks) and burning_ tingling skin_ white spots on my lips and mouth sores...sore throat_ cramps_ made me get my period early (while on the pill) also mouth and lips were all swollen_ red spots on my tongue.,I had to go to urgent care_ where they said it probably was a reaction and to go off of Lamisil.   I did_ but in the weeks that followed I broke out in a ringworm looking rash on my stomach_ which my dermatologist later punch biopsied it and informed me it was indeed a drug reaction.  Also_ I started having Joint pain_ tingling in my hands and arms_ and private parts (very strange)_ chills_ diarrhea_ weird and frequent urination_ tingling in my face_ itching on my neck_ purple spots on my lips as well.  My vision was blurred and I had mucus coming out of my one eye (gross).  I was so scared to death_ I didnt know what was happening to me.  I was also having terrible panic attacks_ and my heart was racing.  I have been off now for 6 months and I am still having swollen lips_ occasional mouth sores_ still tingling in my face and lips_ but it has subsided mostly.  I was given Prednisone and several antihistamines after 8 weeks of being off Lamisil but when I finished the Prednisone_ the reaction came right back.  It was so bizarre_ I feel like I have lost months off of my life and the feeling of 'normalcy'.  If there is a class action suit for this_ I will be joining in.  I hate this drug!  You might be one of the lucky ones to go through with no side effects_ but I was not.  I had every side effect mentioned and I read about the side effects AFTER taking this med.

Extreme fatigue and exhaustion. These crept up on me with at first 2 joints mildly affected until my whole body ceased up. Doctors didn't seem aware of such effects. Blood tests all okay.,The blurred vision and bad smell has resolved 4 days after ceasing the medication. The joint pain is still disabling. I havent been able to get out of bed for 2 weeks now. ...Drinking lots of water but not sure what else to do. Do not take this medication.

However_ never got a cold and shortness of breath continues almost immediately after taking medication.   I tried taking it different times of the day (later in the day_ early in the morning) and its the same thing.   Worst part of all_ the fungus has not changed.

81, 1, Toenail Fungus,I was supposed to take this medicine for 90 days_ but had to stop 22 days early. After about a month and a half of taking this drug_ I began experiencing anxiety and depression. I started having strange thoughts and worrying about things that i knew_ rationally_ didnt matter. I was having extreme jealousy problems with my boyfriend and I have never had problems with jealousy before. Initally_ I thought that my hormones were out of balance_ and I didnt even consider that this drug could be causing my problems. It wasnt until I had a full blown panic attack that I decided I really needed to figure out what was really going on. I was under some stress_ but not anything I havent been able to deal with in the past. I also felt very depressed. Once I stopped taking this medication_ I began feeling better immediately!!

The strangest side effect was that both my breasts were swollen and felt engorged.  They burned and felt as if they were swollen with infection.  I found out that my father years ago had a very similar reaction to Lamisil and had to have an ultrasound.  His right breast was so swollen with lumps.  It was horrible.,Toe is looking better but I will try natural remedies instead of this.  Seriously_ the swelling of my breasts and the pain that came from this scared me.

And like other reviews I've read I was also for many years self conscious about my feet and was finally ready to try something that would work and felt Id take a risk with the side effects bc I wanted this gone! I also have had seizures since I was 12.. So I had a double risk but it was oked by my dr to try.. I thought the medicine would only be tougher on my liver like my seizure medicine.. But now that I look at all these reviews it all makes sense. I hadn't had a seizure in almost 4 years and had one a month ago and my anxiety level has been through the roof!!! Scary.. I was taking way too much medicine to keep myself feeling less anxious but idk why not never dawned on me until now_ I guess I relied on my dr.. But I thought about the lamas il as the problem and looked it up and sure enough I am not alone!! But even though all this negative has happened my toes have all cleared up but one..

88, 1, ,Let me say that if you value your quality of life DO NOT TOUCH THIS DRUG. I was going to hold out on writing this review until I fully recovered_ but I have no clue when or if I will. The first effects I noticed were strange_ intense dreams and terrible fatigue in the mornings. Then I started to feel quite surreal like I wasn't here and got bouts of dizziness. After 6 days I stopped taking it and expected to feel better the next day. The next day I woke up and was even more exhausted and the dreams were even more intense. Terrible anxiety and irritability started and then the joints in my hands_ knees and elbows began to hurt.,cont. Horrific insomnia then began and every time when I actually fell asleep I'd have disturbing hallucination type dreams and then wake up horrified to my core. The insomnia lasted 3 weeks_ I also had crippling anxiety and depression_ and debilitating fatigue and malaise.  It's now been nearly a year and two months since the reaction and I've suffered a lot in that time. The anxiety_ depression were terrible but have eased to a more acceptable level but can flare up. I have chronic fatigue that has improved to a degree but can still be pretty bad and I never feel rested when I wake up. I still have some joint pain in my hands. The worst ongoing side effect is probably the dreams. This drug is capable of warping your mind and what I experienced is like nothing I've ever known. Over a year later and dreaming feels like I'm going off to some insane_ distant land_ like another life. It can be incredibly frightening. If you're suffering a similar reaction hold out because things will ease given time but you need to find coping mechanisms like meditation. My intention is not to scare you_ but others need to know the dangers of this horrible medication. I only took 6 days worth!,M,24,6  days250 MG 1X D,1/16/2015Email,Lamisil

91, 1, Toenail fungus,"After a couple of weeks I started to experience malaise_ aches and just a weird mental feeling_ difficult to describe. Shortly after that _ still feeling bad_ I had a pretty severe ache in my left arm. For some reason I kept going and made it to about 6 or 7 weeks when I lost my sense of taste. The only taste I have is a weird_ bitter_ salty sensation. Flavors of food is severely altered. I quit right away when that happened. Aches and pains are bad enough but losing the sense of taste is really depressing. It's been two weeks and it's still the same. I read all of the bad reviews before starting this ""poison"" and was very reluctant_ yet my podiatrist told me I shouldn't worry about the reviews and take the meds. I really can't believe that so many doctors completely disregard how dangerous this drug is and still recommend it. There must be hella kickbacks for docs to sell this to patients.. I don't know.

The last few nights I could hardly get to sleep but once I did I would wake up in the middle of the night drenched in cold sweat needing to change bed clothes several times a night and the dreams I have been having are horrific.  I've been off of this stuff for 48 hours now and am hoping the residual drug exits my system ASAP so that I can sleep with some peace soon. Also noticed a new aching pain in my right elbow when I have had no recent injury or trauma in that area.  Not worth it. Will live with the toenail fungus and seek natural remedies.

93, 1, Toenail fungus,On the day before Thanksgiving when I was baking sweet potato pies for the dinner I was hosting the next day_ I lost my sense of taste.  I was using the same foolproof recipe and the pie filling was so bland that I thought I had bad potatoes.  I even threw out a bottle of lemon extract because it smelled weird.  I was about to throw the pie in the garbage and then I let my husband taste it.  He said it was good.  Everything I cooked tasted awful to me and I had to use my husband and son as tasters. It quickly dawned on me that it must be the terbinafine because I remembered reading a few comments about the loss of taste when I researched the drug.  I panicked_ got depressed and very anxious at the thought of hosting a dinner where the food would not be food.  How could I adjust the seasonings if I couldn't taste the food??!  I am so disappointed that neither the physician nor the pharmacist told me about this side effect.  The emphasis was only on the liver.  The thought of not having,I am trying to keep this all in perspective and will make the most of not having a taste for good food.

95, 1, Onychomycosis,Many side effects_ the worst of which has been loss of sense of taste.,In terms of side effects_ there is not a way to know if you will have an adverse reaction before beginning treatment.  Losing your sense of taste is devastating and occurs with enough frequency that it is not worth risking_ especially given lack of hard data about when_ or even if_ you will recover the sense.  I believe the risks far outweigh the benefits of this toxic medication.

I took the generic equivalent (terbinafine) from Walmart for the prescribed three months with no side effects_ but also no improvement. Two years later_ a new doctor suggested I try it again_ this time from Walgreens. No side effects or improvement for 6 weeks_ but then rash and itching for the next 5 weeks.

101, 5, Fungal Toenails,Loose stool_ Headaches,I've had fungal toenails for over 10 years now_ (believed to have gotten the infection from my father_ who had awful feet) and at the age of 27 decided enough was enough. It wrecked my self esteem and I couldn't bring myself to wear sandals in the summer or get in the pool with friends because of how ugly my feet were and talk about a relationship killer. I had become skilled in filing them down and painting them so that on a quick glance you couldn't tell what my nails suffered from_ but I couldn't do it anymore and decided the risks were worth it so I asked my doctor to put me on the treatment. I was so scared and read i think every review on the internet_ fully expecting to have all the bad side effects like liver failure and loss of taste. I feel I have gotten lucky !!! My DR put me on a 3 month treatment_ but I did my own sort of pulse method with one week on_ one week off. So far out of 2 of the 3 bottles_ I see pretty pink nails coming up even on my big toe which I was the most concerned about! It's working a LOT faster than I thought it would especially because my condition was so severe and toenails grow extremely slow_ seemed even slower on the medication. The only side effects I have experienced so far is loose stool (tmi_ but for the sake of the review I'm being honest) the entire time i've been on it and some really bad headaches.

I went into a deep depression and had extreme anxiety to the point where I went to an outpatient  hospital program for help. I also had extreme headaches every day. There was no reason for my depression. I had just gotten married and returned from my honeymoon. I thought it might be from the let-down but there was no way that would've made depression and anxiety so extreme. I finally went to my doctor who told me to stop taking Lamisil. I've been off of it for 6 days. Depression and anxiety have gone away almost completely but still have a little anxiety.

It took a good 12 weeks for it to even start to get better and about 16 weeks for it to totally go away.  I had totally convinced myself that I was going to be one of the few where it was permanent and didn't know how I could live the rest of my life like this.

Plain water still tastes terrible to me.  While everyone else is losing weight_ I can't even have that benefit as I am continually eating something trying to get rid of the taste.

Most food tastes terrible_ and water is particularly bitter_ but every now and then_ I find something (like x-cheddar goldfish crackers - go figure) that helps cover this taste up.  My doctor and pharmacist said they have never heard of this reaction_ yet obviously it is more common then they say when you look at everyone with these problems on the board.  I filed a complaint with the FDA for what its worth.  I am finding that I am actually getting depressed and feeling panicky that I might never get rid of this side effect.  I really believed that after I stopped the medication_ that the problem would go away.  Wish there was more information on how long it took people to get their taste back.  I was only on this 10 days - Can't imagine how bad it would be if I was on longer!,F,54,10  days250 1X D,9/18/2013Email,Lamisil

147, 3, Toenail fungus (3 nails),Increasing exhaustion as time went on - for most of the three months I took naps during the day to try to deal with it and I was still more and more exhausted. I'm also experiencing major mood swings. After about 6 weeks my hair began to fall out and it is still falling out as the three months are drawing to a close. I also developed severe hayfever-like symptoms even though I have never had allergies before. My eyes are very bloodshot and uncomfortable and my mind constantly feels foggy_ as if I had a cold. Runny nose. My nails are starting to look better but I can't decide if it was worth it.,Doctors seem not very informed about the side effects of this drug.,F,31,3  months 1X D,8/15/2013Email,Lamisil
148, 2, Massive Toenail Fungus,Abdominal gas_ greasy bowel movements_ change in taste,I am suffering from a massive toenail fungus. Took Lamisil over 4 years ago and it went away_ but within the last year it has come back with a vengeance. I am starting 60 days into the treatment and I have yet to see any new growth in my nails that show the fungus being arrested. My health insurance plan does not pay for the laser treatment_ so I hope this works.  All 10 of my toes are affected. I don;t understand why I am prone to this disease.,M,43,30  days250 1X D,8/12/2013Email,Lamisil
149, 5, toe nail fungus,absolutely none,About 8 months ago I started laser treatments for my toe nail fungus. All ten toes got 6 treatments_ one week apart. 30 days later the doctor say let's try another 2 because he sees no improvement. So 30 days later (seeing no improvement) we have another consultation and he suggests the generic equivalent of Lamisil to be taken once a day for 7 days_ then 30 days later repeat_ then 30 days later repeat again. So I got a prescription for 21 pills @ 250mg. I was very leery of the medication_ but taking it so infrequently seemed reasonable. I am happy to say that improvement is obvious; it looks like another 30 days or so and all my nails will be good. So is it the Lamisil or laser that works? Maybe in my case both were necessary. I think in one year's time my nails will be sandal worthy.,M,59,21  days250mg 1X D,8/7/2013Email,Lamisil

154, 1, toenail fungus,severe itching / hives,This is an updated to a comment I posted a couple weeks ago - went to Allergist yesterday- have had incessant itching and hives for three weeks with no relief.  Allergist explained that it isn't an allergic reaction_ rather_ the Lamisil likely triggered my histamines and it started a cycle that needs to be broken. He said that there is a war between histamines and anti-histamines and whichever is better represented_ will prevail.  In my case_ there was more histamine.  Anway_ he said to take 2-3 zyrtec tablets every day until you are not itching for 2-3 weeks_ then scale back the zyrtec until 1 tablet a week until you are off.  That should take care of the itch / hive problem.  I am now on my first day of being 99% itch free in three weeks.  Hope this helps any others out there suffering the same.  He said it is safe to considerably more than indicated on the box but you may get drowsy.  Drowsy beats itchy by a long shot! Good luck.,F,,7  days250 1X D,7/4/2013Email,Lamisil
155, 5, Toenail fungus,Week 1_  I experienced a real bad headache that wouldn't go away. Gained weight FAST in one week. I don't like sugar_ but I craved it madly since taking Terbinafine_ thus the gain weight right? Yay_ lucky me.,Week 1 was the hardest mainly due to the fear of the vast reviews on the Internet and the warning label on the bottle_ but after the first week the headache went away and began to have more energy than I was used to. I was fairly fit before using Terbinafine_ mainly because I ate well and didn't indulge in sweets_ but out of no where I had uncontrollable sugar craves. I bloated. I was very unhappy for the first month and a half until I began to see healthy life on those awful nails. All my liver panels have been normal. Oh_ I did have to wait a few days for my new prescription to be filled while the doctor waited on the test results. Once I began taking them again_ I once again had a headache for about a day and a half. Nothing else since. I have a couple weeks left to go and my nails are looking good considering I had this for fifteen years_ but they are growing strong. I just threw out all of my old socks away_ bought some sprays and Lamisil cream to be on the safe side. I am happy and can't wait to buy my first pair of sandals.,F,33,10  weeks50mg 1X D,6/26/2013Email,Lamisil

Plus I developed SCURVY due to not being able to take the taste of many fruits and veg_ and have ended up on so many vitamin supplements I rattle. I am prone to depression anyway and although I'm on a high dose of meds this problem is making me feel close to the edge. Everything I drink and most things I eat taste unpleasant. If I thought for one minute I would be like this for life I would be looking into having my taste buds removed somehow and being fed by supplements_ I would rather taste nothing than have this constant nasty taste in my mouth when I'm not eating and have no enjoyment from food.,If you want to feel like you have no quality of life go ahead and take it.

I continue to eat_ in spite of the nausea_ to keep my energy up.  I then began looking for the side effects and discovered that what I'm experiencing appears to be linked to the foot applicable forms of Lamisil.  Trying tea tree oil and apple cider vinegar.

Continued with program and swelling disappeared after 10 days. No other side effects until 4th week when I started having serious constipation_ bad enough to need enemas to have bowel movement. Currently taking 600 mg. Ducosate Sodium to have almost normal bowel movements. Anxiety began showing about the 4th week also_ along with minor depression. After 6 weeks I had to take vacation time due to severe depression which almost cost me my job.  When I stopped taking Lamisil my lower back really started bothering me. Other side effect that I don't know the time table on is sex drive went from drive_ to idle_ to park. When I first thought about taking this regimine several years ago my physician said that the treatment is worse than the cure. I believe him now.

186, 4, toe nail fungus,first week: intense anxiety around midday; possibly sore throat and feeling of cutoff from world (cloudy mind like when you have a cold); transient cramps in legs_ arms and joints. Did blood tests and no problems detected then.By week 3_ all seemed okay so I am continuing with the drug. It is week 5 now,My use of lamisil is in progress - 5 weeks of 12 so far.I procrastinated taking these the last three years due to fear of liver and other side effects and need to curtail use of alcohol. Too soon to say if it is working although I think I see new growth at the base of the nail.Believe I suffered conspicuous side effects for the first week or two: intense anxiety in mid to late-morning; a few days later and running for 4-5 days had cramps in muscles (calf_ joints) that moved around to different parts of my body. Saw the dermatologist then and she ran blood tests (all okay).Side effects seemed to subside by the third week (yay) so now I am comfortable with this drug. One small change I made after day 4 was to try to avoid drinking coffee until at least 30 min after taking the drug. Maybe that helped the anxiety for caffeine apparently can interact with the drug.I hope to end up healthier and to lose some weight since I am not drinking and to develop better habits in that respect. I just wanted to add my opinion - and update on how I got through the first two weeks when side effects did seem bad. It is easier to report bad news than good news.Would love to find out about the laser treatment.

Lamisil is an antifungal antibiotic. Antibiotic hmmm.  You are making the yeast in your body proliferate by taking an antifungal/antibiotic for that long. And are probably causing a secondary infection like candida albicans google it.  I am going to try taking 7 pills for a week then 21 days off for a total of 12 months. There is absolutely no reason to take an antifungal antibiotic for 90 days straight  it makes absolutely no sense and is extremely dangerous to do so.

Nausea.,I was already off sugar and eating a vegan diet_ so I didn't have alot of trouble_ but the depression was unbearable.  I asked the pharmacist if I could take 5-HTP 'cause I knew Lamisil interacts with anti-depressants.  He said no; it's the same thing as anti-depressants.  So_ I went back to my doctor about the depression and he said that the pharmacist was wrong_ so I could take 5-HTP.  That was during the first month.  Once I started on 5-HTP_ and taking the Lamisil with a bedtime snack_ I felt better.  I figured I might as well be sleeping if the pill was going to make me feel lousy soon after taking it.  I needed to take it with food_ though.  So that really helped me get through the whole four months.  I ended up needing to take 100 mg of 5-HTP morning_ noon and supper-time to get through it_ but it was the only way I could stand this drug.  I trust that as my toenail continues to grow out_ the fungus will be gone.,F,59,4  months250 1X D,9/20/2012,Lamisil

I also had a damaged little toe nail that took much longer to grow in.  By the end of the 3 months it was 85% grown out on both toes.  Took diflucan for two months after (2/week)_ with no sides just as precaution_ not sure if i needed it tho as i heard the medication stays in the nail and it should have grown out anyways.  My nails are 100% cured.  I drank 5-6 drinks at a time every couple weekends while on it_ it did not feel good at all and I felt nasty the next day.  I recommend taking MSM (2-5grams)_ as it helps your nails grow much faster.  overall im happy i took it_ in spite of the mild side effects where i felt tired and a little off.,M,35,90  days250 1X D,9/14/2012Email,Lamisil

I decided after taking the drug the second time that I would never take it again if the toenail fungus returned. I decided to try it once again though due to the constant embarrassment I feel over having ugly_ deformed toenails. The first time I took Lamisil I lost my taste altogether which was very depressing. Even water tasted like salt water to me. It took a few weeks for my taste to return to normal. The second time I took Lamisil I made sure to drink TONS of water daily to help flush my system and assist my liver in breaking down the drug. I have not been drinking water as I should on this round_ and I have started experiencing a dull to sometimes severe and persistent headache for the past week. A headache that is not totally relieved unless I take something strong such as a Lortab.

I had liver function test 6 weeks in_ and it was fine.  A couple months after I stopped_ I requested to have another LFT because I was paranoid and it was fine.

When I learned where the liver was in the upper right_ guess what_ the pain shifted to the upper right. I suggest limiting your alcohol consumption and drink lots of water.  I think I had 2 glasses of wine for special occasions.  I even stopped taking acetaminophen. Wait a couple weeks before starting to drink after the treatment is over.  I did not do this_ and that's what really made me start to worry and the ""pain"" increased.  I strongly suggest limiting your internet research if you are hypochondriac.

There was no bald patch or anything extreme_ and my hair still looked relatively normal but a bit thinner than usual_ and *so* much hair came out whenever I brushed or washed my hair. This stopped after the first month. I have seen this side effect reported on many forums about Lamisil.2. SLOW HAIR GROWTH: Since my second month on Lamisil_ I noticed my hair growth really slowed down. It is now 2 months after finishing my 12-week course_ and I have not had my hair cut for 3 months because it is growing incredibly slowly (I usually need a hair cut once a month). Also_ the texture of my hair is different since taking Lamisil_ it used to be shiny and bouncy_ but not it's quite dull and ""dead"". I have not read this side effect in the forums_ so not sure if it's related. But I figured that if the drug has an effect on keratin and nail growth_ it would have an effect on hair growth ...",In my case_ I had toenail fungus in both big toenails following nail trauma when I dropped something heavy on my toes. My nails then started to grow in an uneven_ buckled fashion_ and became twisted_ gnarled_ yellow and disgusting. But I neglected it for 3 years_ and they got worse_ so finally I decided to do something about it and now two months after finishing my 12-week course of Lamisil_ I am seeing some signs of improvement. One toenail partially fell off during the course_ leaving a gross grey-green layer beneath_ and still looks awful_ but both nails are showing a new_ clear_ healthy nail peeking through at the bottom of the fugly nails. So my big toenails are currently one-quarter clear & new_ and three-quarters twisted and disgusting. My doc says as these buckled_ deformed toenails are so huge_ it will take a long time for them to grow out. The drugs apparently continue to work for 6 months after finishing the course_ so I will be patient and see how they are looking at the end of the year. The growth of the new nail is soooo slow_ but hopefully worth it.

Such symptoms included a very rapid heart rate with insomnia and very strange dreams. I can handle to dreams part_ yet not the rise in heart rate! I did see a change in my nail color within 3-7 days which i was extremely happy about. The foot doctor I saw was not giving me the correct advice and said Lamisil was completly safe and It would be the only way to cure my toe nails. I felt like he was not treating my fungus correctly due to my instincts. I am thinking of stopping the medication_ due to the abnormal heart rate which is VERY scary! I wouldn't recommend this product to ANYONE!! If you have these same issues with heart rate increase or sleep disturbances_ please email me.,Thinking of filling a claim with the pharmaceutical company to see what their response is...just out of couriosity. This drug is dangerous!! Try natural solutions...which i will be going that route.,F,35,7  days250mg 1X D,2/15/2012Email,Lamisil

244, 1, Toenail fungus,Lower abdominal pain_ frequent urination_ darker urine_ general fatigue_ slight hair loss_ pain in joints esp. legs & feet_ mood change (sadness_ hopelesness).,Side effects started right from the beginning and forced me to stop taking this drug after a week. Tried again later on for a few days but with the same results. This is the kind of drug that clearly shows that the approval system for drugs is failing patients. The side effects of Terbinafine are quite serious. This drug targets not only fungus cells but also other body cells including in some cases vital organs (liver). In this case the risks clearly outweighs the benefits. Why endanger your life just to treat fungus_ especialy when there are other_ safer alternatives.

I read these reviews ahead of time knowing that I typically experience the crazy ""rare"" side effects of drugs. I was actually hoping I'd have the taste/weight loss side effect but no such luck there. I have had no change in taste or weight loss issues. One thing I noticed right away is that I have to urinate frequently_ including usually waking up in the middle of the night and having to go (almost every night)_ which is very unusual for me (and annoying). I do get headaches (nothing major) which isn't common for me. I notice dry mouth at night and in the morning (I take it at night).

I am now wearing flip flops again. Today I take my last pill of 90 and my toe nails (all 10) are 85% clear with just a little funk left at the end of the nails.

I finished taking the drug 5 months ago and it looks like it's starting to get worse again.  And now I spread it to others through the shower_ very frustrating to deal with at my age.

The good news is that the nail fungusappears to have been cured_ but I doubt that I would go thru theexperience again if the fungus comes back!,"I found that extremely hot showers--using a detachable shower headto target my rash_ would give me relief for 2-3 hours. I would wakeup several times a night to take such showers. Also_ at times_ Iwould use a hair dryer_ putting it on the ""hot"" position and holdingit only a few inches from rash areas.

And my doctor said if i am allergic to this medicine then I would have the rashes right away (not after 4 weeks). I believed him and continued to take the tablets for another week. Then I had to stop. The rashes spread to all over my body - itchy and hot. I could not think of another reason that I have rashes. I never had an allergic reaction to anything in my whole life. I've stopped taking the tablet for 3 weeks now. The rashes become less and less. I did not see any obvious improvement on my toe nail infection.

Otherwise_ nothing noticeable.,I was aware of some risks of using this_ but over many years_ my toenail fungus grew worse_ to the point where the nails on my big toes were extremely brittle and occasionally slightly painful.  They were also getting very tough to trim. After taking for 90 days_ the nails look better (although not dramatically.)  I have been told it takes a while for them to grow out.  However_ the nails are much stronger now_ and at least are not painful any more.

Nail funk really bad back then.  Thick_ yellow and rotten!  One of my nails even fell off.  I took Lamisil then_ it was over $300 a Rx but it worked perfectly.  Had the blood tests_ liver is great.  Now_ my new hubby handed over some funk and I noticed a bit of discoloration and breakage in my nails. Doc put me on Lamisil again because it worked so well before.  Still no side effects.  I actually feel really great!  Seems to give me a little energy!  As long as my liver tests keep coming back good I'll keep using it.

If I drink even one alcoholic drink within a few hours of taking my daily pill_ I get very sharp pains in the liver area.

The skin has peeled off about 5 times over with a red soreness which is almost unbearable. Getting off the medication i then experienced severe itchiness to the groin area. It is like a tingling and my hair follicles are ultra sensitive and rub continually causing an unbearable itchiness. Another way to describe it is like ants biting me constantly. No creams or ointments give relief. Now 6 weeks after taking Lamisil the doctor has no clue what to give me and I am continually in pain.,Going back I have had jock itch for some 10 years.

I have lived on soup_ peppered beef jerky_ raw onions and carnation instant breakfast vanilla flavor. I have contacted a lot of people on this site and all of them recovered except one.

The toenail sample comes back negative everytime. BUt the podiatrist is sure it's fungal the thing is lamisil is only effective against certain types of fungi. IT is not effective against candida which a majority of toenail infections are the drug sopranos is used in that case but it is one of the most dangerous drugs I have tried. It works great but always comes back with a vengeance after discontinuation. Its important to get a positive diagnosis antifungals aren't to be taking lightly they can do irreversible damage to ur liver take lamisil for longer then the 90 days preferably for 180 bc u only have one shot to kill it after that fungus becomes resistant to lamisil and it will never work the same again.,M,30,90  days250 mg 1X D,6/7/2011Email,Lamisil

Now that I'm reading other people's comments I am thinking that my hair loss_ joint pains (which also have become more frequent a few months into it)_ lethargy_ occasional heart palpitations and anxiety might be related.,Heart palpitations and anxiety could be due to change in certain life circumstances_ although I have not had such a reaction to change in circumstances before and if anything_ the drug may have exacerbated anxiety.,F,34,4.5  months250mg 1X D,2/7/2011Email,Lamisil

They cracked and got thick and it was uncomfortable to walk.  I have an auto-immune disorder and was hesitant to take the drug_ but I did fine.  My toe nails are almost all grown out and I am happy.  It is a thrill to see pink nails with a white top after looking at horrible yellow thick nails for so many years.  I can't wait to wear sandals this summer.

I recommend to any young people with fungus problems - don't delay; I wish I had taken the lamasil years before. I attempted the full gamut of topical applications_ including expensive ones. But please don't drink alcohol during the course of treatment - my reaction to tiny amounts of alcohol was phenomenal. And drink lots of water. I think it's also wise to eat a very healthy diet during treatment - so your liver is taxed as little as possible. ,F,53,8  months250 1X D,12/29/2010Email,Lamisil
343, 5, toe nail fungus,None. Topical Lamisil works perfectly.,Directions for use:Apply white vinegar to each nail with a brush.Apply a coating of Lamisil creme once a day in the morning before putting on socks. Please note that this takes 6 months or so and the processed may work faster if application is 2 times a day. You will see amazing results in 6 months. Plus the nail will thin out and not remain thick due to the acidity of the vinegar which allows the Lamisil to permeate into the nail.,,58,6  months30mg 1X D,12/27/2010Email,Lamisil
344, 3, Fungal infection spread over body,Chest pain.,I've had to use several (what could be considered) heavy medications in the past_ and I try to simply take the necessary medication without worrying too much about possible side effects if it is really needed. (If I feel it's not needed I'd rather search for a more natural solution though). Same goes for Lamisil. I had a fungal infection that had spread completely over my body; after two months I felt I'd take about anything to get rid of the itch and skin problems. As such I was not too worried about possible side effects. Now_ 3_5 weeks later_ I'm not too sure anymore. The pain in my chest seriously makes me doubt whether I should continue taking it. Is the benefit worth the possible negative. On the other hand: how sure can I be this chest pain is a result of the Lamisil (never had it before though). I'm not sure. Right now I'm saying 'no way'_ I've never experienced cheast cramps and pains taking any medication_ on the other hand it is easy to conclude this now now that my skin concerns finally have improved. I'm not sure what to do might the rash and continuous itch on my skin come back. In short: positive is the fact it definitely helped after about 2-3 weeks_ negative is the fact I developed chest pains (that I suspect to be the result of the Lamisil).,F,28,3.5  weeks250mg 1X D,12/25/2010,Lamisil

346, 4, Toenail Fungus,I had lower back pain if I didnt drink enough water with the pills.,I had the nail fungus on all 10 nails. I took Lamasil and the first few weeks were hard due to slight change of taste_ then I realized that if I took the pill at night before bed with a full glass of water_ my taste was fine. So I continued with that. Now my 3 month course is over and more than half of each toenail bed is healthy and growing out. They seem to be growing fast. I love this medicine and I cannot wait until summer to wear flip flops again. TIP: Dont read too much into these things. Its really in your mind. If you get all panicked and start thinking it wont work for you_ it wont! Everyone is different_ just go with it and if it doesnt work then stop but dont stop because you get scared of what happened to others. Nothing happened to me_ had my liver checked 3 times_ and I'm perfectly fine. My toenails are looking great.

I also encountered major pains in both knees. The pain isnt always in the same spot and sometime bounches from knee to knee. I'm unsure if this is connected with lamasil_ but after seeing a doctor and physical therapaist and doing blood work everything came back to be normal. I'm a young fit healthy 27 year old and never had any knee pains prior to taking this medicine. I discontinued use last week and the pain almost instantly went away. My muscles are sore from the physical therapy but I believe all knee pains are gone. My physician didnt go over the side effects of this drug and I wish he had.

Since then_ I have been researching another drug I just started about a week before the loss of taste_ but thankfully I just discovered Lamisil is the culprit. I will stop taking it tomorrow! No problems with smell_ but have completely lost any sense of taste now. I hope to have a quick return of taste as it already ruined my Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas is just around the corner. I plan to call my orthopedist tomorrow and ask that my bloodwork be repeated as a precaution. I was not verbally warned by my doctor or pharmacist of potential side effects_ other than liver.

361, 1, toenail fungus,I lost my taste on exactly six weeks into the medication.  My doctor did  not inform me that this could be a possible side effect so it didn't occur to me until I started doing some research. It started by losing a taste for salt and then for sweets and then completely.  I stopped taking the drug immediately and had a liver panel done and those results came back fine but I the loss of taste was/is so disorienting that I decided to stop taking the drug even though my toenails were clearing up nicely.  It has been about 3 weeks since I stopped taking the drug and I feel as if my side effects have gotten worse rather than better.  It feel like I just ate a teaspoon full of salt.

363, 1, Athlete's Foot,Extreme fatigue_ heart palpitations_ anxiety_ blurry/double vision,I was warned that about potential side effects_ but the fact that I'm extremely healthy was supposed to virtually eliminate the risks.  The side effects came on slowly_ starting with the mono-like fatigue_ growing anxiety and heart palpitations_ but they were bearable if it meant getting rid of the rash.  I finally discontinued taking it when my vision suddenly changed (right eye seemingly worse) and the symptoms included: double vision_ blurry vision (it would cut in and out) and halos around lights at night.  I stopped taking it two weeks ago and my energy level has increased_ heart palpitations have stopped and anxiety has largely dissipated.  Unfortunately_ my vision has not come close to fully returning to normal and I'm hoping that it will completely recover with additional time.

I tried everything before taking Lamisil and my only regret is not having tried it sooner! People online talk about vinegar baths_ Vicks_ Listerine_ tea tree oil. They all miserably failed in my case and I was persistent with my at home treatments. If you have a very mild case_ these things MAY work_ but if it has been years do not waste your time or money. Try Lamisil once. Do not listen to those people that say avoid it at all costs. They are welcome to their opinion_ but they should not tell anyone to not take a drug just because they had a bad experience with it. You are different and until you try it_ you never know how your experience will be. I am proof that you can take this drug symptom free and get great results!! My new pink toenails were almost fully grown-out after only 3 months! I am waiting on my one big toenail that will take another couple months according to my doctor since it is a larger nail.

I'm stopping the drug at this point.,No side effects first time around except mild headache and drug worked great (Lamisil).  On Terbinafine this time around (about 10 yrs. + after first taken).  Very different this time and not a good thing.  Feet are swollen and painful to walk on.  Labs were fine before taking and liver enzymes still good.  Joint pain_ though_ and muscle pain.  Was going to see a surgeon wondering if I had an inguinal hernia and as joint/muscle pain got worse and spread to knees_ shoulders_ fingers_ ankles (started in hips)_ decided to look it up since I had had a similar experience when taking Septra (a sulfa drug) years back.  Amazed to see how many people say same - my pharmacist actually said it looked like it would be a rare side effect if that was what was truly happening w/me.  After lying on couch all day yesterday feeling so sore I couldn't believe it_ I've now decided I will have to save up for laser - I can't keep doing this drug at this point.  While toenail thickening is much lessened_ I don't see good growth so don't think its really working - I am on my last refill of the 90 day treatment (once a day).  Penlac lacquer didn't work_ either (but it was hard to do this faithfully).  PS - taking it at night didn't create a taste issue for me_ thankfully.

I did noticed some good nail growth after just the one week of use. Unfortunately_ I noticed hair loss about one month ago which became worse this week. Yesterday I lost about 50 hairs between bathing_ blowdrying and brushing my hair.  Luckily I have a thick head of hair that still looks ok.  However it feels substantially thinner.  I will not take the next two (week long) doses.  I guess I will have to seek out lazer therapy for the nail fungus?

Increased fibre intake via vegetables.Believe this protected my liver from this toxic_ but effective drug.Nail bed now clear for 1st time in 10 years_ and hoping rest grows out without re-occurance. Had IgG and IgM test for candida_ which came out very high (way above normal)_ so will stick to anti-candida diet for at least 6 months further. I believe the school of thought that a fungal nail reflects more serious fungal problem internally_ often caused by passed antiobiotic/cortisone use.This diet change is starting to have amazing health benefits_ and with the help of a few colonics_ constipation now gone_ so pleased I took the course_ but NEVER again.,M,49,3  months250 1X D,9/9/2010Email,Lamisil

My toes look somewhat better_but it's to soon to tell.  Nothing in life comes without a price. I don't want to have to cover my nails with nailpolish for the rest of my life.

I told my doctor not to recommend it to anybody. He seemed to agree that it was the lamisal that caused the taste loss and now that i read the comments i realized that the severe rash i had a month ago was probably the lamisil also.I thought it was from working next to a tree and i was allergic to the tree.

385, 1, Nail Fungus,Side effects started after 3 weeks of taking Lamisil.  They include hives_ rash_ swollen hands and feet_ severe joint and muscle pain_ sore throat_ and difficulty swallowing.,Do not take Lamisil if you are allergic to Penicillin or Sulfur antibotics!!!  I had the same allergic reaction to Sulfur just a year ago.  The difference is that I had the Sulfur antibotic in my system for just 2 days.  Lamisil has been in my system now for 3 weeks.  At first it was just a swollen thumb on the left hand.  The next day 1/2 of my right hand was swollen with terrible joint pain plus my feet swelled.  Could not walk without pain.  Discontinued used that day.  The third day my throat started hurting_ my feet were still swollen_ and the rest of my hands were swelling.  The swelling was accompanied by joint pain.  The next day the pain moved up to my arms.  This was more of a muscle pain than a joint pain.  Last night the pain went to my left knee.  Today my hands and feet are still swollen.  The joint pain has lessen on my left hand_ but not on my right hand.  My muscles in my arms still hurt when I move them. My feet do not ache_ but my knee does.  My throat does not hurt.  Besides the pain_ I still itch.  Like everyone else who has visited this site because of reactions_ I wish I came here to read the reactions prior to starting the meds.  I was told by both a pharmacist and podiatrist that this medication is well tolerated.  I can only assume that as the medication gets out of my system that I will get better.,F,48,3  weeks250 MG 1X D,8/22/2010Email,Lamisil
386, 4, Toenail fungus,Metallic taste in mouth somewhere between weeks five and six.  Initially it was pronounced when eating/drinking some foods or liquids.  However_ it seemed to come and go in the remaining weeks of completing this medicine to where it was really not noticeable.  I completed the 90 day treatment early August.  I did notice some additional hair shedding a few weeks into the treatment which stopped after about two weeks.  Hair loss of this type is not permanent as it is a response to the medicine_ the same way going under anesthesia my cause some people's hair to shed.  The hair will regrow.,I was concerned about taking this drug as my family physician would not prescribe it because she felt it was very dangerous.  My podiatrist felt otherwise.  He believed it safe so long as a person had no signs of liver issues.  Since he was aware of my concern_ he said I could have my liver checked again after the first 30 days_ then again after 60 days to help ease my fears.  I felt this was a safe and acceptable option.  As my initial liver test was good_ I opted to have my liver function retested half way through at 45 days.  Again_ the test test came back good.  During this time_ I did consume wine in modertion.  I have no health problems and experienced no other side effects than what I provided.  I rated this a 4 only because I am having trouble determining if it was fully effective as toenails grow out slower than fingernails.  I had fungus on five toenails.  The fungus did not discolor my nails_ only thickened them making them uncomfortable and requiring me to file them down_ so it is harder for me to tell if it is working.  I believe the new growth may not be thickening up_ but think it will take another few months to be sure.,F,55,90  days250 1X D,8/20/2010,Lamisil

I have lost 6 pounds and I do not need to lose weight!,Do not take Lamisil.  I spoke with 3 doctors (family physician_ oral surgeon_ and hematologist) and none of them had heard of this side effect.  I informed my podiatrist of the side effect and he told me to stop taking the drug.  I have been off the medicine for 4 weeks now and have regained a lot of my taste back_ except sugar.  I anticipate it will take a few more weeks to regain this taste (I hope).  Regaining the taste is very_ very_ very slow_ but it is coming back.  There's hope for everyone who has lost their taste with this horrible drug so keep the faith.  I drink vanilla instant breakfast a lot and drink grape flavored water.  I can eat french fries and fried eggs.  Once I regain my total taste back_ I am going to write the company and the FDA and let them know that this drug needs to be off the market!  This website has helped give me hope that I will be able to taste normally again!  Thanks to all that has posted to give me hope!

It seems like its working because it looks like its being contained. My toes look a lot better than what they looked like before. So maybe for those who are sensitive try taking it at night.

Of course_ I had stopped to take the drug immediately. During that period_ I lost 10 kilograms of weight_ and this forum helped me a lot to find things I could still eat_ and provided solidarity. I notified the French Agency for Medicament Security of my side effects from Lamisil knowing that the pharma industry does not care.I had the Lamisil treatment for a toenail fungus_ which previously had been unsuccessfully treated with locally applied medicine like nail lacquers_ creams_ etc. Not willing to ever more take the risk of taking a systemic fungicide_ I decided to treat my severely infected toenails with Dakin's Solution_ essentially a sodium hypochlorite solution (check the web for Dakin's Solution). Once a week_ I wrapped the toe to be treated in a small piece of paper towel_ soaked with Dakin's_ during 10 minutes. Three weeks after the onset of the treatment_ the affected nail surface began to shrink. After 6 months_ my toe nails were like new.

Five treatments in total over 4-5 year stretch. Contracted fungus at age 23.  I warn everyone when taking this drug seriously consider the effects it will have on your body ruined my taste  and  don't feel like  myself anymore.. All oral antifungals are prescribed without thought by  Dr's.  It amazes me this drug was ever approved.  My advice is if you ever do decide to take Lamisil which all Podiatrists will say is the best therapy( Lies) take it for 6-7 months with liver panels every month to check for liver function. And not the 90 days they suggest bc the fungus will  come back bc  90 days is not enough to kill the fungus. And you will have to take it again. Hit the fungus in one long treatment. And make sure you get a precription for Penlac topical which helps tip of nail. while using the Lamisil. Neither medicines have worked for me and i refuse to ever take it again my body can't handle side effects anymore.  I am going  to try the Laser therapy(PinPointe) it is expensive but its supposely 85% effective unlike Lamisil which is only 30%.

That may sound strange_ but the horrid metal taste that you can't get away from and the loss of taste for so long just makes you angry.  Did you know your life revolves around food?  I never realized that until now_ socially especially. I hate this drug - it really isnt worth it.  Unless the fungus is just horrible_ which mine wasn't_ don't take a chance with any of the bad side effects.  Girls_ we can just paint our toenails_ guys don't have that option.,I lost my taste completely and had a strong metal sensation in my mouth after 25 days on the drug.  Of course_ my doctor and pharmacist said it wasn't the Lamisil_ but thanks to this web site and others_ I know it was. It was weird that the Doctor that recommended it to me and the pharmacist that sold it to me_ weren't interested in trying to figure out what in the world had happened to me.  I guess they think that if it is approved by the FDA they don't have to be concerned about the patient's side effects.  The mental aggrevation of this was probably as frustrating at the actual side effects to my body. I want to thank the person that wrote on this site on 2-5-10 that explained that we will get our taste back and the exact experience he had.  It gave me hope.  I began to get slight hints of taste or just sensations of taste on my tongue after 3 weeks of discontinuation of the drug.  Over the next 4 weeks I have very slowly regained most of my taste.  It comes back very slowly.,F,49,25  days250 1X D,4/10/2010,Lamisil

436, 2, tonenail fungus,loss of taste,I lost almost all my sense of taste after being on the generic form of Lamisil for 1 month... in early December 2009. From my research_ this happens to about 3% of those taking Lamisil.  This may sound like a small number_ but it represents about one out of every 33 people who take the drug.My experience paralleled that of others.  I lost my taste over the course of just a few days after having been on the drug for a month.  The only things I could taste at all during the following weeks were tomato soup and_ to a lesser extent_ cheese... especially no fun over the holidays!  I had stopped taking the drug as soon as the side effect evidenced itself (though my doctors_ surprisingly_ had not heard of this effect... If I hadn't researched_ they'd have been testing me for other causes...).After about 3 weeks into my loss of taste_ I slowly began to regain it.  Little by little_ things began to return to normal.  The last category to return was sugar - which wasn't regained until almost exactly 2 months after ending the drug.  Again_ this 2 month period is the same as reported by many others.  It's now February 5_ so things just returned to normal for me within the last week... I wanted to be sure at this point to return to this forum (where I'd gotten a lot of information before) and let others know who suffer this loss of taste that it will return.  It can be scary.

I hope everyone will read this and consider this treatment.  I tried 3 courses of Lamisil_ 3 months each time. It looked like it was working one time but the fungus never completely went away. I was very concerned about liver side effets. Today I am fungus free by using 2 drops vinegar on each toe_ twice a day. I've done this for 11 months as instructed by Dr Walt Stoll website. I want to spread the word as the toe fungus is humiliating_ and the vinegar treatment really works. That was all I used_ and it worked 100%. No meds. You MUST keep up the vinegar as instructed; don't get discouraged.,F,45,3  months,1/26/2010Email,Lamisil
438, 4, Tonail fungus,Diarrhea the first couple days. Not much else.,I had my toenail removed due to an injury to it. At the time my doctor wanted me to take Lamisil for 30 days and use clearly confident cream during the healing. After speaking with my mom who works for a podiatrist_ I went with their advice not to take the Lamisil. Over a year later the nail grew in only halfway and became thick and slightly yellow.  I went back to the Dr and this time he offered a low dose method of 8 days on_ off for 6 weeks_ and on again for 8 days. I decided to take the chance as the nail looks awful.  After my first 8 days I did not have much in terms of side affects except a little diarrhea the first couple days. Now I have to wait 6 weeks to take the other 8 and see what happens.,F,34,8  days,1/25/2010Email,Lamisil

I did not notice any severe side effects- except maybe at the week mark losing a sense of taste and appetite but it came back. Now I have been off of it for 3 weeks_ and found out that I have liver damage. Scary_ that I didn't even have warning signs_ and don't know what treatment I will have yet. Also_ it looked like it did nearly cure it_ but it's coming back and it wasn't that severe in the first place-was only 1 big toe without about 40 percent showing infection_really regretting taking this although doc tried to talk me out of it_ because he has seen several cases of liver damage before.

445, 1, Fungal toenail infection,Loss of taste_ hot flushes_ dizziness_ muscle pains_ headaches_ nausea_ severe fatigue_ mild constipation_ loss of sex-drive_ depression,I was prescribed lamisil via post from my dr. and not warned about the side-effects. Initially_ it seemed to be fine and was helping kill the fungus. However_ ~ 6  8 weeks into the 10 week course_ I noticed that my morning coffee no longer tasted as it should and then other foods / beverages suddenly started to lose their normal taste  cheese_ beer_ pizza and pasta tasted particularly bad. I thought I must just have a cold starting but then I started to get hot flushes_ and muscle aches and felt extremely tired which made me think I had the flu. I visited my dr who didnt think the lamisil would be the cause and assured me I just had a viral infection. Two weeks later_ I was still suffering and by now had become extremely depressed so visited my dr. again who this time took a blood sample but was still not convinced that the lamisil was causative.  The blood test came back fine and Im now starting to feel better ~ 4 weeks after stopping lamisil but my taste has still not fully recovered and I only hope it will soon. To anyone thinking of using this drug_ I would urge you to take much care and to perhaps monitor your time on it very closely.

455, 1, toenail fungus,elevated liver function levels_ red_ itchy skin_ depression_ anger,"My doctor wouldn't give the drug to me because he said it too dangerous to use for ""cosmetic reasons"" (I had toenail fungus).  So_ I went to another doctor who prescribed it for me.  In the end_ I wish I had listened to my doctor.  The side effects were too much for me to handle.  This drug is POISON.  It's okay to use for a few days_ but in order for it to cure nail fungus_ you have to take it for months!  Even if you're one of the lucky FEW who has no symptoms_ it's still poison.  Long story short_ afterwards_ I found something NATURAL that will get rid of your fungus and I know the frustration you're probably feeling so I want to share.  Go to a natural drug store.  Buy 1) grapefruit seed extract and 2) a high ppm colloidal silver tincture.  Start slowly with the grapefruit seed extract_ by taking 3-5 drops in a full glass of water morning and night_ then work up to about 15 drops_ morning and night.  Also_ keep your nails cut super short and right after a shower (the more you do this_ the better)_ put the colloidal silver all over your nails (in the cuticle area_ around and under the nail_ on the skin_ etc.).  Colloidal silver kills just about everything.  If you can find one that has tea tree oil in it_ even better.  The idea is to get rid of it from the inside and the outside.  This worked for me.  I got rid of mine in 1 yr.  Sure_ it took a little longer than Oral Lamisil ""claims_"" but I didn't have to take POISON to do it and it works.  I promise.",F,26,60  days,11/24/2009,Lamisil

I kept taking it for another week after first incident and had several more incidents like this_ especially when I had been drinking.,I stopped taking lamisil 9 days ago and keep feeling anxious although it seems to be lessening. Things that I can normally deal with seem to put me in a panic. The sensations have gone from my head filling up to annoying bubbly_ swelling feelings in certain areas of my head and a kind of tightness in my cheeks. I never really had much if any trouble with anxiety before taking lamisil. I felt like I was going to pass out or puke or die. I'm still kind of freaked out because the symptoms haven't fully gone away. I haven't noticed any improvement in my toenails either.

466, 5, Toenail fungus (left big toe),None that I could directly relate to the drug,"Just finished my 3 month supply and so far so good! Before treatment I thought I had eczema AND fungus because of the red_ peeling irritated skin and little blisters and the thick white nail. My regular dr. told me to watch it on 2 visits in 6 months; went to a walk-in and the dr. there said ""yup that's fungus"" and I got on Lamasil that night. Now the top half of the nail is white and thick_ bottom half is growing in pink and pretty. Hope it works for good!",F,25,90  days,10/27/2009,Lamisil
467, 1, toe nail fungus,slight numbness of the mouth and gums from the second day_ numbness/loss of sensation on my right hand (initially I thought this was because I had slept at a wrong angle although the numbness was more severe than what one gets when ones hands go to sleep)_ and on day six frightening numbness and loss of sensation in the rectum and vagina area (lasted only a few seconds but was very frightening) . I immediately discontinued lamisil,even though I took it for only six days it appeared to be working - but I thought the side effects were not worth it,F,42,6  days,10/25/2009,Lamisil

On top of it I had an awful salty taste when coming sweet things. 5 days after stopping the drug: the bad taste went away. But I am still waiting for my hair back damit.,M,31,11  days,10/20/2009,Lamisil
470, 1, Toenail fungus infection,Hair loss_ shedding_ thinning_ salty taste,AWFUL.I would not recommend this drug to anyone: my experience was just awful. My hair has become significantly thinner than it was before_ and also I have noticed a significant hair loss. God_ I really hope it will get thick again and grow back. Ugly salty taste appeared on the last day of treatment_ but went away as soon as I quit the drug.,M,31,11  days,10/20/2009,Lamisil
471, 3, Spreading toenail fungus,Dyspepsia_ diarrhea_ gas_ chronic stomach pain,I lived with toenail fungus on left big toe for about 30 years_ tried all kinds of topical cures and none worked. When the fungus started to spread to other toes_ I decided to try generic Lamisil. I am 8 1/2 weeks into 12 week course. Almost immediately_ I got strong heartburn and stomach cramps. Daily doses of Xantac knocked down the heartburn. At 5 weeks_ I started getting loose stools which came with massive quantities of gas. It quickly degenerated into chronic_ almost debilitating diarrhea_ gas and stomach pain. A dozen or more trips to the bathroom a day are not uncommon_ including waking up at night. The doctor prescribed a daily regimen of Imodium but that is having little effect. The only way I can do anything socially is to not eat for 12 hours before the event and then tank up on Imodium before I go out. Incredibly_ I have not lost any weight during this ordeal which leads me to believe I would have gained a lot had I not been flushing everything through my system so fast.If the diarrhea had started sooner than 5 weeks_ I would have quit the medication. I'm going to tough out the remaining 3 1/2 weeks but will not take this medication again if the fungus recurs.,M,67,61  days,10/19/2009,Lamisil

473, 1, Fungus,Loss of taste,I posted in July of this year. 48 year old healthy female_ educated_ married mom of three with mild toe nail fungus on two nails. Tried Penlac without success. Normal liver panel before starting medicine. Never read the Internet rumors etc. about Lamisil until I lost my taste and wondered what was up. Then I found this site. Loss of taste doesn't sound so bad until it happens - it was  scarey because it made me wonder what else Lamisil was doing that I wasn't aware of. It took 6 weeks for taste to come back and I am unhappy to report: I still have the fungus. I am very wary about Lamisil - I would not take it nor would I recommend taking it. Not worth it - don't start it!,F,48,42  days,10/17/2009,Lamisil

477, 3, toenail fungus,loss of taste,Day 11 on Lamisil_ after having the fungus for 5 years. I tried Penlac-which btw has only a 10 percent effective rate-what a waste of time and money_ then used several herbal remedies to no avail_ including thymol. The risks of Lamisil are pretty scary to me_ but I have seen photos of advanced disease that look like monster feet. That is my motivation for wanting to take the 90 day Lamisil plan and keep my fingers crossed. I just lost most of my sense of taste today and it's weird but I am going to try to put up with it. Pictures of monster feet make me lose my appetite_ too!,F,47,11  days,10/6/2009,Lamisil

479, 2, Toenail Fungus,"My original post is from 9/23/2009. I would like to answer some questions. ==== I did take these pills almost ""blind""_ only knowing about possible side effect on liver. ======= It has been 11 days since I stopped taking the pills_ but my taste is still the same = bad (like baking soda_ saulty_ bitter). Also_ yesterday I got hives! I cannot say for sure at this time_ if this is Lamisil side effect or if it is caused by stress or food. But I did read here (after stopping the med) that some people got hives/rash. It is bad - small/large red spots_ swallen_ itching_ very innoying_ and not pretty...",If I would have known before about all these issues_ I would NOT take Lamisil at all. My doctor said that I am his 1st patient with such side effects. ====== Good luck to all!,F,40,37  days,9/29/2009,Lamisil

Day 44 I got a constant taste of salt in my mouth and most food tastes bad.  Eggs and nuts are the only proteins I can stand to eat.  I am so glad I found this website.  I asked my doctor if I was experienceing side effects of this medicaiton and I was told no.  When I asked the pharmacist today if this were a possibility_ he immediately said ""yes"".  I've noticed significant hair loss the last couple of days as well.  I wanted to be able to wear sandals. I have seen no change on my little toe.  For the first time in five years I have new growth that is clear on my big toe.  I'd sure like to know how to prevent the fungus from spreading again.

The only thing I recognized was a slight taste thing...a minor price to pay for the fungus FINALLY going away!,"try it ""blind"" for a few weeks_ THEN see if any symptoms match.

483, 2, toenail fungus,Within 10 days of treatment_ I started tasting sweet foods as bitter_ and had a bitter aftertaste after all meals. I also have developed arthritic pain in 3 of my right hand's fingers_ and mild headaches. When notified about these effects_ the dermatologist who prescribed it was impatient and said the side effects would not harm my health but it was my prerogative to stop taking the drug (I'm taking the generic version). I WILL definitely stop taking it! I wish other people could also comment on how long they experienced the side effects_it would be horrible for me if the neurological damage behind the changes of taste was irreversible or very long-lasting_ but the prescriber never replied to my question about the long-term duration of the side effects I am experiencing.,Since the info coming from pharmaceutical companies emphasizes mostly the positive effects (and this drug is clearly effective with fungal skin infections)_ only websites like this with imput from people who have had bad  side effects as well as good results will give balance to the marketing push. There are many variations in human responses to drugs and it is very important to know this in the process of personally weighing the toxicity against the effectiveness of a drug as toxic as lamisil. It has been very helpful for me to learn of other patients side effects_makes me feel less isolated.,F,64,20  days,9/25/2009,Lamisil
484, 2, Toe nail fungus,I took my 1st 30 day supply of generic Lamisil and everything seemed to be normal. Then after 7 days of my 2nd round of 30 day treatment_ my taste has changed! It felt like I drank very salty water with some bitter taste. It affected water and any food_ that I ate. My doctor told me to stop. I have not been taking pills for 5 days now but my taste is still bad. Even though my liver test is normal and my toe nail started slightly to improve_ I have decided to stop taking Lamisil. I am concerned about what else it may do. And I really hope that my taste will come back and soon!,Also_ I have been feeling tired. My CBC count was not good and my thyroid number (TSH) raised.

Was only on it for 2.5 weeks and I am quitting right now.  I didn't relate the achy joints and weight gain as first.

It looked like it was working one time but the fungus never completely went away.  I was very concerned about liver side effets.  Today I am fungus free by using 2 drops vinegar on each toe_ twice a day.  I've done this for 11 months as instructed by Dr Walt Stoll website.  I want to spread the word as the toe fungus is humiliating_ and the vinegar treatment really works.  That was all I used_ and it worked 100%. No meds.

Took it for 6 days_ back pain was so bad I had to stop. Have been off it for 3 weeks now still have annoying back pain but it is somewhat better. Started to notice joint pain in my fingers during the pulse dosing. That is still as bad now. My doctor said I had a allergic arthritis reaction to the drug and it should clear up with time.

I wish I'd done this earlier because I've had this fungus for years.

On the same day as the change I developed a nettle rash and hives all over my body. I went to an out of hours doctor who gave me an antihistamine injection_ prednisalone and fenofexadine. He said that the reaction was probably a delayed allergy to a pill. I have never had an allergy before_ and was on no other medication. I am 64.After a week I had to go back on the steroids and the antihistamines for 8 days. I shall continue the fenofexdine up to a total of 3 weeks.

I also have had fungus in one nail for many years.,I took the generic form of Lamisil and was doing great until day 50.  The foot rash went away within a matter of weeks and I was also starting to see new healthy growth of my nail.  BUT then there was a stomach bug going around my family that unfortunately I picked up and then I become very ill. The stomach bug stayed with me for  about 2 weeks_ I finally went to see my MD who asked me to stop taking the Lamisil since I was given a very strong antibiotic for the stomach problem.  I checked with the dermatologist that prescribed the Lamisil and it was uncertain if the fact that I was taking Lamisil compromised my immune system and why I could not get rid of the stomach bug.  The only way to determine was for me to start the Lamisil again.  After being sick for 2 weeks and getting behind at work I opted not to take Lamisil again.   I do see a tremendous change in the nail that had fungus_ looks so healthy and actually my nail has not looked this good in approx 10 years.,F,44,50  days,8/6/2009,Lamisil
498, 2, toenail fungus (9 of 10 toes),Sudden total loss of taste after 45 days of treatment_ also put up for weeks with some unusual lingering muscle pain in one extremity (arm).,"Six days ago I would not have considered posting comments like this about my daily regimen of one 250 mg tablet of terbinafine hydrochloride (generic Lamisil)_ because as far as I was concerned my toes were clearing up wonderfully and there was new healthy toenail growth where there hadn't been in more than ten years. Some muscle pain developed in one arm_ but I was very happy with the tremendous progress I was making. But things have changed very drastically_ and very quickly - for the past five days I have had NO sense of taste_ and have decided that daily pill #50 (of planned 90) that I took this morning would be my last. I am a healthy 48-year-old male with a normal range BMI_ taking no other medications_ so there is nothing else I can blame for this inability to taste anything. Searching the Internet today for side effects to generic Lamisil_ I came across this comment page where I found MANY people associating this inability to taste with this medication. In questioning the medical professional who prescribed this to me_ he was not even aware of this side effect. Online descriptions of this drug list ""change in or loss of taste"" as a MINOR side effect_ but let me tell you that it is minor only if it is happening to someone besides you... As for me_ I am going to hope for the best with the treatment so far (as my toe nails do look healthy) and end the medicating today. Hopefully I haven't killed off my taste buds for good.

499, 4, toenail fungus,horrible rash,I was only able to take the drug for 10 days before my body was breaking out in what started as little red bumps on my stomach then quickly spread and grew in size all over my body_ the bumps were really hot and burning me and then they started to blister up and burst_ I had to immediately stop taking lamisil and go on antibiotics_ the rash went away after about 2 weeks_ I now however have some scars from the massive size of the blisters.  Thankfully lamisil appears to have done its job in the short time I took it which surprises me because I have been hiding my feet since I was 12 and when I say hiding I mean literally no one - not even my husband has ever seen my feet!  They just joke and say I dont have feet I only have socks and NO ONE KNOWS why I'm horrified at the thought of anyone seeing my feet - its been my best kept secret to date....needless to say_ I now have a new nail growing in and for the first time its not bumpy or fungusy_ its not 100% clear (I'd say about 90%) but its definitely a HUGE improvement - I've been using Fungicure in the mean time to try to kill off any fungus that may have survived my breif attempt with lamisil - so far so good!,F,24,10  days,8/5/2009,Lamisil
500, 4, some type of tinea corporis,None yet.,I just wanted to add my comment about this drug even though I've just started taking it. I am on day three_ and I have not experienced any side effects at all. I'm worried because of all these comments_ but I'm hoping I will be one of the ones who don't get them. I have a bunch of random fungus spots on my skin_ and my doctor says I am a person who is prone to getting these infections. She says that some people are just more sensitive to them. I've been going to the weight room a lot_ so I think I might have caught it there. I tried using Ciclopirox_ which is a topical prescription cream; it cured some of the existing lesions_ but more kept popping up and I couldn't keep up with it. I finally caved and took the oral meds because it's getting ridiculous.

My son who is 11 also has problems with his toenails and now he is takeing lamasil. He has 20 more days left to go. Very much pleased. I had checked w/Pharmacist and he told me it can affect your liver ONLY if you take it for long periods of time and 90 days was not going to hurt anything. Liver function test were fine!!

I feel the need for a tums more often than I used to_ but I could use the calcium supplementation anyway.  Took Generic.,"Definitely helped.  I've had this fungus for 10 to 15 years now.  I tried having the nail removed with no cure.  This has all but the tiniest sliver gone.  I read that Lamisil stays in your nail bed for a while after you stop taking it_ but I may visit my doc anyway and get her opinion.  I heard pure cranberry juice is good for your liver_ helps to clean it out.  I can't reasonably afford that_ but I bought the no sugar added variety from Ocean Spray and drank 8 oz of that every day.  Kept away from alcohol.  Wore open-toe shoes to prevent recontamination (ideally).  Eating a larger variety of veggies_ too (also heard that was good for the liver).  I can't avoid painkillers and other things that aren't good for the liver (except alcohol) because I get migraines a few times a month and ""can't live"" without my meds.  Very healthy_ otherwise.

Also have had loose stool_ with some yellow watery discharge_ ben VERY anxious... I have alreay lost 10 pound and I am skinny to begin with. I went to the DR and all my liver functions and blood tests came back good. Could this possiably be caused by the Lamisil.

About a week in I had a nausia spell that lasted a few hours_ but went away.  Went in for my 6 week liver check and everything was fine_ and just finished my prescription a few days ago.  Definately DO NOT DRINK while taking the medicine_ even though I'm done taking it I'm still waiting about 2-3 weeks before I consume alcoholic beverages.  I am seeing some great results_ but as everyone knows toenails take FOREVER to grow out.  Do yourself a favor and give it a shot_ talk to a few doctors about the pros and cons.

Most of my nails were fungal_ and I see an improvement in 2 or 3 of them_ but the more seriously diseased nails are still pretty bad.  I've been using tea tree oil as a topical treatment to prevent a relapse_ and I know that it's early to judge the efficacy of the Lamisil_ but I'm a bit discouraged.  The fungus has been present for nearly 20 years in a couple of the toes_ and I wonder if the sheer duration contributes to how stubbornly it persists.  I'm not too vain -- I'll wear sandals -- but it's not attractive_ and sometimes ingrown nails result.  I'll withhold judgment until late fall.  If the nails are still like old brick mortar_ I'll try thymol.,M,53,3  months,6/11/2009,Lamisil

This side effect is more disturbing than you would think.  I plan to post again when taste is restored because the worst part is that there are so few postings to provide any insight as to how long this will last and it is very scary.

I then took the drug with great trepidation and great trust in God to get me through.  I praise God for his aid.  My toenails responded well enough for me to don flip flops.  There is a new laser treatment at approx $1000.  I learned of the laser midway through my 90 days.  I had my midway doctor visit with no change in my liver test yet another answered prayer.  I then questioned my physician about the laser who expressed great faith in the laser.

527, 2, Toenail Fungus,Rash_ Rash and more RASH,After 3 weeks a spot showed up. At first I thought I had ringworm and did not associate the red mark on the middle of my chest with the medicine.  However_ after 2 days of treating it as if it was ringworm_ the rash continued to grow and showed up in a dozen more locations. I called the doctor who had me stop taking the Lamisil and said I was having an allergic reaction. Now it is 2 weeks later_ the rash is all over my chest_ back and arms and has not gotten any better.  I called again and they said it may take 2 to 3 weeks to go away_ but I'm calling again to get an appointment and see if a shot of some sort is needed.  What really ticks me off is it was working and my toe nail was starting to look better. But knowing what I know now_ I would NOT do this again.,M,55,3  weeks,5/3/2009,Lamisil

I can see the new nail starting to grow in an im really pleased. Hopefully I will continue to have good results and no side effects.  After reading this forum i have noticed that most side effects seem to occur with older people.  I wonder if there is a correlation between this or if its just a coincident??

He said that this method works just as well but is not as rough on the liver.  No problems for the first few days but have noticed some pretty bad cramping in my legs for 2 days.  Luckily I only have one day of pills left this month....and then I get 3 week a break.  **I also got #90 pills at Wal-Mart for only $10.00 which is a lot cheaper than my $40.00 copay that I have for most prescriptions with my insurance**,F,33,6  days,4/7/2009,Lamisil
535, 1, toe fungus,No side effects until week 3 or 4.  I woke up in the morning to start my daily routine and felt my hands were itchy and a little rashy.  My legs felt the same way.  I called the doctor and asked if I could take a benadryl (25 mg.).  I took a benadryl & then jumped in the shower - after the shower it seemed to be getting worse (I found out later that warm water makes allergic reactions worse).  I took a 2nd benadryl because it seemed to be spreading.  My lip then started to swell and itch_ and I noticed my face breaking out - called the doc back and was told to go right to the E.R.  At the E.R._ I was given prednisone & monitored for breathing.  I was sent home with a prescription for prednisone and an Epi Pen.  It is now day 5 without taking lamisil and I'm still experiencing redness.  The doc said it will take time to get out of my system & the prednisone is suppressing the allergic reaction.,I wouldn't take this drug.  I was hesitant before even trying it because of what I had read about it_ but my doc said it would be ok.  After this round of steroids_ the doc is going to try diflucan for me.

My upper lip looked like one of Angelina Jolie's lips_ but not in a good way.  (Think Octomom!) I had to go to an urgent care center_ but even the meds I got did not work right away. It took a full 5 days for the itchy_ splotchy rash to go away after I stopped taking the pills.  My podiatrist said it was probably my sun exposure that caused the itchy rash. (I do have sensitive skin.)  I was really shocked this happened b/c I had never_ ever had an allergic reaction to anything in my 45 years of living.  I was very disappointed to have stopped this medicine b/c it was working.  (I can see a little bit of pink coming out!?) I now have to go back to covering up my nails with nail polish.

I have fungus on the left great toe and have had for years.  Recently the nail has become much thicker and I can't cut it anymore myself so I wanted to pursue treatment. My podiatrist gave me a few options_ none of them being promising except this one. He did a blood draw before I started the medication and he'll do another one this week to check liver enzymes. I don't like taking medication because I usually have problems with most everything I take.  This being no exception.

I've dealt with an untreated black nail for years before I sought treatment. I thought I was beyond helping. But_ much to my surprise_ I see clarity as the nail is growing out.

After two more weeks I developed a worsening rash that spread over my back and down my arms and legs_ some spots on my forehead. The spots range in size from pencil eraser to nickel size_ red and intermittently itchy. Some spots are dry and scabby. I stopped the med but two weeks later still have the rash!

Now I can't tolerate hardly any other medications because of the peripheral neuropathy that this Lamisil CAUSED!  I have prickly burning pain especially bad in the limbs_ and even feels prickly on my face.  It's worse if I take Ambien or Lunesta for my insomnia_ or even over-the-counter Guaifenesen (Mucinex) for sinus problems--then the prickly gets worse.  My new doc prescribed Lyrica for the neuropathy_ but I can't even tolerate it.  This all started 8-9 months ago when I was on the Lamisil.  It's no longer a ""SIDE EFFECT.""

Just had a liver function test and everything is fine,I was scared to death by all the bad comments on the site until I started scanning for the happy people's comments.  One of them felt just like me that many of the happy people probably don't take the time to post on the site.

559, 5, toe nail fungus,no side effects at all/ very happy with the results!,I have now completed my 90 days and I am thrilled! As one of the previous people said_ I lived miserably for 2 years_ hiding my toes_ no sandals & such because I was SO terrified by all of these testimonials of awful things ( and SO many for some people). I agree with the previous person_ I eat healthy_ low fat_ exercise & dont smoke_ and had none of these problems. My only regret was not starting the drug sooner. I think its very unlikely this one drug can cause the thirty different problems that people have come up with. Next thing you know_ they'll blame the economy on this drug!,F,44,90  days,1/20/2009,Lamisil

I'm actually on my 2nd round of it.  I had toenail fungus in 2 toenails 12 years ago_ and took Lamisil using the pulse method.  It cleared it up entirely.  10 years later_ after living overseas it came back FAST and in all 10 toes.  This time I'm taking the 90 day course_ and here I am_ on day 82_ and my nails are already halfway grown out PERFECTLY NORMAL.  I can't wait for this summer to get here so I'm not stuck spending my days filing down the thick nails and painting them so they look normal from far away...

I did experience side effects like people have mentioned but didn't seem to suffer from severe reactions that would have made me discontinue the drug completely. My doctor wanted me to take it for 5 months but after one month and using the PULSE method of a week every month after that I feel this is the most appropriate treatment for me. Look up PULSE method on google. My doctor didn't recommend that method to me but due to side effects it seems like it works for me after the 1st month of being on it continuously. I used terbinafine hydrochloride_ the generic version.,M,39,60  days,1/12/2009Email,Lamisil

I knew that the drug was toxic because my Doctor made me take many liver tests before giving me a prescription. In addition_ I ran into a nurse when first buying my prescription and she tried to talk me out of using it...just cover it up with nail polish she said...my case was very minor_ but I was tired of wearing nail polish and more determined than ever to rid my body of the fungus...After starting Lamisil_ I read this website and was astonished at all the negative comments...I came across one that said you have to keep in mind when taking this medication...no pain...no gain. I persevered and finished the medication because I wasn't about to let this fungus under my toenails embarrass me any longer...I'm now done with my three month supply and my toenails look almost normal...my doctor told me that it often takes eight months after taking Lamisil to have your nails fully grown out without,F,43,90  days,1/3/2009,Lamisil

I am unable to register anything sweet and what I can taste does not taste the way it is supposed to - I am miserable.  Water is very nasty_ most foods are either very salty or blander than bland (tasteless)  or simply horrible.  My mouth has a constant salty ""taste"" in it. I am nauseous almost constaly_ especially after eating or drinking anything.  I also get frequent acid build up in my stomach. - I quit the lamisil 2 weeks ago when these symptoms began and I still do not have my taste back.

No problems with my tastebuds; however_ there was weight gain in spite of the fact that my diet and exercise regimen has not changed.  I'm anxious to complete this medication_ and looking forward to the end results.  I've had this problem for several years_ and was VERY hesitant to take this type of drug.  I tried numerous other methods to address the fungus; NOTHING else worked_ and it continued to get worse.  So far the benefits seem to have outweighed the side effects.  I'm just hopeful that I can get my weight under control; have more restful nights; and can enjoy exposing my feet this summer.  :-)  I'll provide an update within the next few months.

I'm amazed at the spectrum of reactions - I was and still am in perfect health. If you're fit and healthy_ and eat a good diet_ should be fine. But don't drink on this medicine!

I would prefer to not take prescriptions if it can be avoided but I've tried all the home remedies that do nothing but diappoint you time after time...vinegar_ Epsom_ peroxide_ bleach.....I even taped a lemon around my big toe over night when I first had the infection cause I was told that it would raise the acidity in the nail and make it hostile for the fungus to live in.  I've only been taking the pill for 23 or so days and can see at the base of my nails that there is some clearing up going on.  People who don't have an infection in their nails don't  realize how humiliating it really can be...I feel like I'm getting a huge Christmas present and I'm giddy with anticipation for something most people don't think twice about.....I'm really bummed for all you ladies and gents who are suffering...ideally it would work for everyone...hopefully something even better will come along...chin I guys,M,24,23  days,8/1/2008,Lamisil
607, 5, Toenail fungus,Been taking it for almost two months as the fungus spread on almost all my toenails_ so far i have not had any of the symptoms that could arise from taking this medication. Keep in mind everyone will react differently to this medication.,I can see lamisil is doing good progress on my toenail_ on my left foot which was less affected by the fungus it is approximately two thirds clear and healthy but on the right foot as it was the most affected by the fungus it is taking longer to clear_ only about one third is clear. Again_ everyone will react differently to this medication and so far I've been lucky that i have not had any adverse effect with it.,M,30,2  months,7/30/2008,Lamisil
608, 5, Toe nail fungus,Nothing except weird smelling poo...,I had toe nail fungus for years on both big toes that started to speread to other toes_ which freaked me out_ because I am a hygiene freak.  I am on day 89 of 90_ and my new nail growth is a healthy pink.  I think that most people who comment on these sites have had negative experiences and you don't hear the positive experiences.

In June 2008 I had a sudden Achilles Tendon rupture; doctor was asking if I had taken any antibiotics.  I said_ ""No""_ because I forgot to mention the Lamisil.  Now that Cipoxin_ a quinolone_ is implicated in tendon ruptures_ I wonder if Lamisil affected my tendons.  So far_ no one else here has reported it.  But I wonder!  It's 1.5 years since use.",F,48,5  months,7/23/2008Email,Lamisil
610, 3, Toenail fungus,Bad taste in mouth_ some hair loss initially,One thing to consider when reading the comments on this site is that people who were dissatisfied with the product are the ones more likely to comment. Lamisil is the only medication that had a noticeably positive effect on my condition_ and the side effects for me were relatively minimal. After the second course of Lamisil_ the fungus had totally disappeared. Unfortunately_ it came back_ so now I've just finished my third course and hope it will clear up permanently.,F,57,3  months,7/20/2008,Lamisil

All the side effects I had were minor and didnt really impair my quality of life.  I am starting to see some improvement in the nails (on my feet).  I did break out in hives but mostly on my legs and some on my torso which are almost gone now.  It created a feeling of depression for me (i am the happiest person ever) but I had to focus on overcoming it; by not letting the medicine control the way I think.  I have been reading this post for a while because I was scared as hell to start the medicine but so far_ its not so bad.

Both those side effects almost disappeared after 2 month of taking drug. Also little bit  of hair loss (but it can be as a result my iron deficiency). And abdominal pain during jogging (it stopped after I finished taking Lamisil). I was aware about Lamisil side affects_ but decided to try_ and think in my case it worthed it.

The rash quickly developed into a much worse rash and I went to the ER where I was given a diagnosis of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.,This drug is poison!

I also couldn't exercise for at least 3 hours after taking the Lamisil or else I would get abdominal pain lasting all day.  I'm a bit worried about my weird periods....it has started 4 days early each month and is extremely light.  The gas and bloating is extremely annoying_ but tolerable.  Overall_ the side-effects are annoying but not bad enough to make me stop taking the medication.  Although I am very eagerly awaiting my last dose.  My toenails seem to be clearing up nicely.

Also_ you cant be too sure about the other risks with it - not worth it.,Stopped taking it - hopefully the rash goes away soon. Doctor never warned of these side effects.

A word to the wise_ don't believe all that you hear or read.  The mind is more powerful than we realize and if you psyche yourself out before taking lamisil and tell yourself that you are putting a toxic poison into your body you will feel just that_ it's true! I took the pill right before bed every night_ that way my mind was asleep.  I really don't support pharmaceuticals and don't take any other than this lamisil_ I was desperate and had tried everything for the last 15 years.  I don't regret my decision.  My liver function tests always came back great_ but I am healthy and don't drink and/or do drugs and I don't take any medications.

629, 1, Athlete's feet,Did not take it thanks to common sense and this site,As I see here_ most people took lamisil for toe nail fungus which is harder to cure as athlete's feet. My toe nails are absolutely ok. It was prescribed for me to treat athlete's feet. I only had it for couple of months and it was only on one foot and not so bad I have seen on some pictures on the internet_ only a patch about 3x3 cm. So when dermatologist prescribed not only topical treatment but lamisil pills for 28 days as well_ I was a bit surprised because I have heard it is quite a heavy medication and may damage your liver. He told the drug was safe if I drink a lot of water and avoid alcohol. No liver tests were taken and I was not advised to come back for any tests after treatment. I bought all the drugs he prescribed but after reading the lamisil leaflet decided to use only topical creams because nausea and diarrhea was mentioned as very common side effects and I was going abroad for 3 weeks with several long distance flights (and some parties with old friends and a few drinks,F,35,0  days,5/30/2008,Lamisil

I've had an echo cardiogram and ekg.  The echo said I have a slightly enlarged left side of the heart but two Dr.s say it is not out of the ordinary.

655, 1, slight toe fungus,An itchy rash that started on the back of my head.  Then it came out on my back_ right in the middle_ of course.  Went to four dermatologists - NO ONE KNEW HOW TO HELP ME.  Never take prescription drugs - especially this one.  I have had this rash for four (yes_FOUR!) years now and probably will have to battle it the rest of my life.,Should be banned in the United States.,F,, ,3/10/2008,Lamisil
656, 2, toe nail infection big toe + others,Didn't notice any significant side effects,My doctor DIDN'T advise to take it for only 3 months. I have just finished taking it though due to no improvement in symtoms. But I was taking Lamisil for 10 months!!!! So dangerous not to be advised earlier!,F,30,10  months,3/2/2008,Lamisil
657, 1, Doctor's Order,I didn't take it_ after reading coments on this website.,Forget the Lamisil.  Go to your corner drugstore and spend a few bucks on VICKS VAPO-RUB !   It cures toenail fungus with NO side effects !  Just rub it in to your toes every night_ and that's it !,M,69, ,3/1/2008,Lamisil
658, 1, Toenail fungus,The worst possible,I had pretty much all of the worst of the side effects_ depression_ unable to eat and feeling all around bad. I stopped taking these about maybe 7 or 8 months ago and eventhough I am mush better then I was when I was on the pills. My nails are great and everything_ I still have episodes. I'm not completely myself and I don't know what to do because when I did go to my doctor with the side effects in the beginning he said that he hadn't heard of them and maybe it wasn't the pills. He didn't believe me but I know it was the pills. All I can say is no one should ever take these pills because you are still going to be dealing with the side effects for months after finishing the pills.,F,21,4  months,2/26/2008Email,Lamisil
659, 5, Toenail Fungus,None,I've had my toenail fungus since I was in my mid 20's. I always assumed that for some reason my toenail became disconnected from the skin. My big toe was disgusting_ I was embarrassed and reluctant to go barefoot or wear opened toe shoes.  I visited a doctor about 5 years after it started_ but he said all he could do was to remove the nail and that he could give no guarantees it would grow back. Im 51 and the problem started to spread to my other big toe. The embarrassment was too much I decided to go see a doctor and see what could be done. He took a sample of my nails and determined it was a fungus. I was prescribed Lamisil and filled the prescription through my insurance carrier and was given a generic pill.  I just finished my three month treatment 4 weeks ago and I'm already seeing good results. I wish I took a picture of my toenail fungus prior to taking the drug. I would've of made a good case study for a commercial. I had no side effects at all. I'm extremely satisfied,M,51,90  days,2/24/2008,Lamisil
660, 1, toe nail fungas,LOSS OF TASTE BUDS!,I have been taking this medication now for 6 weeks (half way mark) and will discontinue because it is affecting the quality of my life.  At 4 weeks lost my sense of taste buds_ everything I eat tastes like nothing.  Its like eating and drinking the taste of water.My mood has also been affected_ cranky all the time_ and not to mention no sex drive.Its not worth loosing one of your senses over this.So i guess i will just live with the fungas and be sure to hide my feet in the sand in the summer.,F,38,6  days,2/18/2008,Lamisil
661, 1, Fingernail infection,2 days of dizziness_ 1 week of headache_ 1 month of abdominal pain/cramp which hasn't gone away yet 4 weeks after quitting the pill...,I had read all the comments here_ but I wanted to try anyway... One of the most regrettable decisions of my life... I have been suffering strange abdominal cramps/discomfort on the lower right. It started on the 8th day. It has then spreaded to some nerves probably_ because I am having pains on mu hip and legs too... I don't know what the hell this drug did to me... Doctors can't diagnose anything... I can't believe I am in this kind of problem all of a sudden_ just because of a small infection I was trying to heal... I beg people who read this. You never know what this is going to do to you. JUST STAY AWAY... I wish I had done that :(((((,M,33,11  days,2/11/2008,Lamisil
662, 3, Slight fungus on both great toes,For the first 2 weeks I had extreme nausea_ fatigue_ insomnia_ and a metallic taste in my mouth that could not be attributed to anything else because I do not take any other medications.  Those side effects diminished a little in the following weeks_ but there would be days where my tongue felt as if it were burning.  My doctor claimed she had never heard of side effects such as I was describing_ so I referred her to the Internet!  I did stay on the medication for the entire 3 months prescribed by my doctor.  My LFTs were never abnormal; they were checked every 3 months and were fine.  However_ the fungus is still present on my left great toe at the point of entry.  My toenails have grown a good bit over this time period_ but the area on the left edge of the left toe has not changed.  It just grows back in looking exactly the same as it did when I started.  I am now experiencing the pinching sensation again as well in that area.  The right great toe looks fine.  It is back to the docto,,F,43,90  days,1/29/2008,Lamisil

At this dosage_ only one inital liver function test necessary - does not require continued monitoring.  Nails are already growing in very clear.  NO side effects.  Would highly recommend this treatment. Will probably take 8-9 months_ but so does everything else.,Okay - one funny side effect....REALLY smelly poo!

665, 3, toe fungus,Ive had toe nail fungus on my left foot infecting 4 of my toes for about 10 years now. It got progressively worse as the years went on and it became painful to run or wear closed toe shoes..not to mention embarrasing when wearing sandals. I tried every over the counter remedy. I finally visited my Dr. and although he didnt really recommend it bc of the side affects I figured I had to try bc I was desperate. I took it like the pill..7 days morn/night_ three weeks off for 4 months. It dramatically changed the appearance and feeling of my infected toes. However_ I didnt have money to continue it and I believe my toe hadnt fully grown out yet. It was healthy for about 6 months then came back. I am now on it again bc it went generic.,I dont have taste problems or back pain or nausea. I was willing to take the risk after I got back the results from my liver/blood test. However after reading all the feedback I think Im going to stop it bc there are more bad comments than good.,F,30,5  months,1/22/2008,Lamisil

668, 1, Nail fungus,Sudden taste changes after 5 and a half weeks. didn't connect to Lamisil initially. Complete loss of taste and sudden dizziness after 6 weeks - scary. Everything tasted salty_ even water. Salty things and sweet thing had no taste. Chocolate tasted like a lump of fat. Most disturbing constant salty taste. Taste has gradually improved over 2 weeks after stopping Lamisil and is now (thankfully!)getting back to normal. Dizziness lessened after about a week of stopping but still get occasionally.Hasn't fixed my nail.,Don't ever take this! No nail problem is worth these risks.,F,44,6  weeks,1/14/2008,Lamisil

Happened again last night_ so came looking for possible causes and ran into this site.,I have since May 07 beens suffering with a horrible_itchy_ hive-like rashes that resembled ring-worm_ on my legs.  Dr.treated me with Gris Peg which cleared it up temporarily. Two mos. after treatment_ symptoms showed up again. Dr. told me that my nail/fungus & athletes foot had spread to my skin.  I've never heard of such a thing. I've researched multiple sites and have never found any such similar exp.

671, 1, toenail fungus,At the six week point I lost the ability to taste.  This was very distressing and I was not able to find any information about how long this might last.  My doctor and pharmacist were both clueless saying they had never heard that before from previous patients.  I called Novartis (the drug manufacturer) and was not given any useful information only to contact my doctor who as I said_ didn't know!  I could not register sweet taste at all and what I could taste didn't taste the way it was supposed to - it was literally like eating garbage!  Water was foul_ coffee tasted like salt_ meats were extremely gross.  I have had a continual bitter taste in my mouth and have developed a sore throat and a gnawing sensation in my stomach - I think it may be acid reflux so I'm taking Prilosec OT which seems to be helping.  I quit the lamisil 4 weeks ago when these symptoms began and I still do not have my taste back.

I would not recommend this to no one.  It's not worth the risk and what I am still going thru everyday_ I seem to get worse.

It takes Him_ and all I have just to make it day to day_ as I'm not taking no other med to try to feel better_ Im too scared of their side effects too.

My taste does seem to be off a little. This started on day 34 of taking the med and one week later the rash is still spreading. Defiinitely a med reaction per pharmacy and MD. I have a medrol prescription which I haven't filled yet.  The med really made the skin on my feet soft again.

I just finished taking my 3 month course and I see results already.  I wish I had taken it sooner.  I was given generic Lamisil (terbinifine) 250mg. once daily.  I tried all the other stuff (vinegar_ bleach_ vicks_ tea tree oil) nothing worked.  Trust your doctor.  This is the only way to cure toenail fungus because it needs to get treated through the bloodstream.

Figured that since I just had a clean bill of health (liver panel) and the drug went generic I would give it try.  I took the pill on Tuesday at 6:00pm with dinner.  By the next day at 4:00pm I had a rash that developed under my right arm pit that ran from front to back.  I also developed a rash that started in between my butt cheeks all the way to the front.

To my surprise a number of sites came up and I found out I was not alone. I called my PCP and the dermatologist and told them about it. Both told me it was very rare and my taste would return. After going through all the material on line I called the doctors back and told them to go on line and then tell me its rare. I was very upset with the side affect and let them know any time they prescribe this drug_ the patient should be told about the potential for loss of taste besides the liver damage Lamisil may cause. Your doctor should draw blood before you even start the drug to be sure your liver enzymes are normal. Anyone with liver trouble should not take the drug.

About 20 minures a a time ar as long as I had time.All of my 3 toe nails are now all healed _ no sign of infection any more. Email me if you like. I'll be more than happy to share with you the good news. It cost me about 2 gallons of white _ cheap vinegar ($6) after suffering for about 5_ 6 years and lots of money on medicines that are good for nothing. IT DOES WORK. Try it and be patient. REMEMBER the vinegar needs to soak into the nail as much as when you get the nail soften by being in the swimming pool. that is when the vinegar really get to the fungus.The infected nails were just so soft and bad that they peeled off  after the vinegar got to the fungus.,F,51, ,9/17/2007Email,Lamisil

694, 2, Toenail Fungus,My doctor told me theres never usually any side effects. The first week I took it I experienced constipation_ slight diarrhea_ stomach upset. But a few weeks later i got over the symptoms mostly. About 6 weeks into treatment it was working fine_ until I went to a party and drank a few beers_ i got really drunk like i've never gotten before so i am pretty sure lamisil lowers your alcohol tolerance even though i was never warned about anything between the two(lamisl+alcohol=don't do it). The next day i was sick to my stomach_ this is when I first got all of my symptoms for months/weeks to come. I had all kinds of blood tests_ and expensive xrays_ even a frickin stool sample- but everything looked good_ my doctor pressed on my liver and it felt a little sensitive-but many liver panel tests showed no sign of anything wrong.I looked at this website and had a strong feeling it was the lamisil built up in my system. I immediately stopped taking the lamisil the day after the party. The symptom,I think the body takes a long time to get this stuff out of your system since it is a drug that builds and stays in the system for months.   My father took this drug also and had no side effects-so this proves everyone is different.Also_I went to Greece/Europe when I had these symptoms and I asked a pharmacist over there about the drug lamisil and he looked it up and said that it is dangerous and very strong and only in America is it usually prescribed. The only reason I give this drug a rating of 2 is because it actually did clear up my toenail fungus but at an unbearable price(feeling like im gonna die for months)-i'll take the fungus anyday.

754, 5, Toenail Fungus/Athlete's foot rash,Malaise_ depression_ fatigue and chronic headaches plagued me toward the middle of 3 month treatment. I am now nearing the last two weeks of treatment and considering stopping the medication. The side effects seem to worsen through the treatment. I'm also quite bloated_ gassy and retaining water. It really makes me quite ill. All of these symptoms are uncharacteristic of my body before taking Lamisil.,The medication has worked as described and the fungus is off my foot and nearly grown out of my toenails. I'm very happy with the result_ it's just a difficult med to physically tolerate.,F,27,3  months,4/5/2007,Lamisil

Unable to wear anything that shows forearms_ legs_ feet_ etc.  It is truly a disfiguring_ gross_ rash.,"They don't tell you its only effective about 30% of the time!!!!

After 90 days on Lamisil about half of one of the toenails had new pink growth. The other one (the little toe) hadn't grown enough to see whether it would grow out without the infection.  I have now been off Lamisil for 90 days. One toe seems completely cured. On the little toe I am just beginning to see new pink growth. I am hoping that within the next 6 months_ it will also be completely cured.,M,44,90  days,3/31/2007,Lamisil
757, 5, toenail fungus,The only side effect that I may have is some weight gain.  But that could just be a normal thing for me since my weight fluctuates.  I've read that some people have had depression from taking this medication.  I must say that I am taking Celexa which is for anxiety and depression.  I was taking this medication before the Lamisil_ so maybe that is why I haven't had any depression or anxiety.,I have been taking Lamisil for about 4 months now.  My big toenail on my right foot was always bloody and peeling_ very painful.  I have had this fungus for about 10-11 years.  I also had the fungus on my two little toes.  Since taking the Lamisil_ my toenails have grown back and are now almost back to normal.  I am hoping that the fungus does not return.  Oh_ I am going to get my first pedicure since having this fungus.  I am so excited!  The Lamisil has definately worked for me.   However I do believe that everyones bodies are different_ and different drugs effect us all differently.  For those who can't take the Lamisil_ hopefully there will be something on the market to take to get rid of this painful fungus.  Good luck all and God bless!,F,42,4  months,3/23/2007,Lamisil
758, 4, toenail fungus,none,I have fungus in my big toenail right foot_ and both little toes. I haven't really noticed any side effects_ but I have had some weight gain over the past couple of months_ about 7 lbs up to 120 from 113_ mostly in my belly_ and am quite gassy sometimes_ but nothing else_ no dreams or loss of taste.  I am also starting to go thru menopause so weight gain could be a combination of things.  I only have 10 days left of a 3 month regimen.  I can't tell yet if there is any improvement_ doctor says it could take a while for it to show_ and may increase prescription another month yet. I run also and some damage of toenails is from my running.  All bloodwork and liver tests continue to come back normal.,F,44,90  days,3/21/2007Email,Lamisil

That was just 3 days ago_ and I haven't decided what to do next. I am still feeling the same effects and they are unpleasant enough that I'm not looking forward to carrying on. I have seen improvement in my nails_ but it's definitely not worth possibly messing up my system. I think I'm going to hope that the side symptoms abate soon_ see what happens with my nails in the meantime_ and then maybe use one of the mitigated regimenes that others here suggest--either half a pill every three days_ or go off altogether for three weeks and then on for one week. I'm thinkint that maybe the one dose a day for three months is more than I need since my case is not extremely severe.

I called my doctor's office and they said it probably wasn't related to the Lamisil but to stop taking it to make sure. I took another pill a week later over a weekend when I knew I wouldn't be driving_ and within four hours I was incredibly drowsy and dizzy. I ended up sleeping that night for thirteen hours and still woke up very dizzy and with a heaviness in my legs.

I am always worried that the symptoms are caused by something worse_ but then I talk myself out of it telling myself that it is just all a part of this medicine.  On a lighter note_ the toenails and fingernails are all clearing up_ I can see maybe 6 of the toes are completely clear and the other two are clear at the back where the new growth hasn't fully taken over yet.

I don't think the 'pulse' dose would work for me - my toenails are BAD. Tried the vinegar treatment for 18 months absolutely no effect.

This led me to believe that most likely it was something internal.  I have recently come off of the medication_ but I am still suffering from the severe stomach pain_ diarrhea_ headaches_ fatigue_ flatulence_ diarrhea_ and skin rash.  The big downside is that Lamisil does build up in the blood stream_ and can remain in the system for a long time.  Now it is a waiting game to see how long these symptoms will persist.,F,26,50  days,12/8/2006,Lamisil
798, 4, Fungus in both finger and toe nails,At the start of the 6th week_ my tasetbuds went haywire_ seemingly overnight_ everything tasted like cement (except corn flakes and chocolate pudding !).  This lasted throughout the 12 week regimen and I am now off the drug for 8 weeks and I have about 85% of my tastebuds back.  I lost 12 pounds since I could only stand a few bites of anything because of the bad taste.,I stuck with it because it did clear up the fingernail fungus_ and I 'hope' it has worked on the toe nails_ although I can't tell yet because of how long it takes the toe nails to grow in.  I can see some clear nail on some of them but I am not sure I can see that on all of them.  If I had to do another lamisil treatment to work on the toenails I would think long and hard because of the taste problem_ but I might do it again because it would really be wonderful to not have to keep hiding my toe nails.  And now I know that my taste buds do come back_ albeit a few months after ending the treatment.,F,46,12  weeks,12/1/2006,Lamisil
799, 1, toe fungi,Bad reaction that happened after 5 pills of Lamisil 250.  Bad rash all over my body_ burning sensation and itching.  Started with severe rash up my legs that turned red_ itchy and resembled welts.  Dermo ordered to stop taking the s..t and began treating the effects with anti-biotic ointment_ burn ointments and vinegar soaks and washes.  It has been close to a months and more of the rash comes up now and then but in lesser intensity.  Skin burning is also going away_ scalp itching is subsiding and there is little hair fall out.  Disgusting stuff especially if you are over 40.  Do not use if you value your health and well being.

803, 5, mild/moderate case toenail fungus,I had absolutely no side effects whatsoever from oral Lamisil until the 9th week of the 12-week treatment. I was impressed with such clear sailing up until then! I am relieved to see that others have experienced chronic lower back pain particularly toward the side of the waist; upper back pain_ chest heaviness/discomfort/pain; heartburn and an upset_ gnawing stomach.,I am truly dragging myself to the finish line of the 12-week treatment program with about 10 tablets left to take.  I see a marked difference in my nails though and I believe they will be completely normal again in the months ahead.  I'm looking forward to it and think a month of discomfort was worth it to cure/treat this disease.,F,52,11  weeks,10/29/2006,Lamisil
804, 5, Toe nail fungus on all 10,Tired at first_ and a funny taste in my mouth for the first month_ second month I began to feel better.  Third month_ if there are any side effects_ I can't tell. :),I am into the third month of Lamisil and I am just now beginning to see some changes in my toes. I was afraid that it wasn't going to work for me_ but now I am so pleased and I can't wait until the treatment is done.  I had severe fungus on one toe_ and mild signs of fungus on my other toes.  The toenails were very thin and frail_ but now they feel stronger. The worst toenail was thick and dark_ and now I notice the monster nail has grown out considerably and is being replaced by a much clearer nail.  I can look at my toes and happily anticipate the summer_ and wearing flip flops...instead of the dread that i usually feel! After reading this forum_ I know that even after finishing my last month_ I can still expect them to continue to improve! Yes!,F,41,3  months,10/28/2006,Lamisil
805, 3, Finger nail fungus,No side affects at all until the beginning of the fourth month.  I then noticed lesions developing on my chest_ back_ arms_ and legs.  My dermatologist took me off the lamisil five weeks ago and the lesions are still horrendous.  They are not painful but sometimes itch.  My internist thinks I may have vasculitis.  Blood tests were taken with the results due next week.,I was on the medication for three months and two weeks.  Due to the lesions my dermatologist took me off. It helped my nail fungus but after reading articles on vasculitis I am very concerned about my overall health.,F,57, ,10/26/2006Email,Lamisil

After 6 weeks  of taking Lamisil I lost my taste_ thirsty but water taste terrible food taste like cardboard.  Soft drinks and everything else tastes terrible.  Dr never told me about any of these side affects.  Have felt depressed_ have been impatient and anxious.Look pale.It appeared that the fungus was getting better so I began the second phase of 42 days at a cost $518. at WalMart...Took 10 pills from this second phase.,In my attempt to find out about my loss of taste I found this website and feel terrified to know of all the bad side affects others have experienced as well. I am going off the Lamisil.  I think it is a dangerous drug and should be taken off the market and it is frightening to know that the doctors won't tell you of don't know the possible side affects of this dangerous drug.

811, 1, Toe Fungus,First of all_ I would tell anyone taking the drug to stop immediately.  I took the drug for two months_ it did not heal my toe fungus.  Later I had trouble breathing and it kept getting worse until I finally went to another doctor.  Ater taking a CT Scan_ they found a mass as large as a football on my liver.  I had to have surgery and lost one half of my liver.  It has been a year since my surgery and I am still recovering.  Ibelieve lamisil was the cause of this.,,F,57,60  days,10/21/2006Email,Lamisil

813, 1, toenail fungus,Felt thirstier than usual but no other side effects until the 23rd day when I noticed a terrible rash on my chest_ back and stomach.  I immediately stopped taking lamisil and took OTC benadryl but rash continued to spread to legs_ arms and neck within the following week.  Rash was horrible looking. The last and worst to get the rash were the palms of my hands which involved 2 more weeks and lots of itching and peeling and   exposed reddish skin.  Soon after_ the bottom of my toes started to peel too. I had mild itching up until my palms.,My husband and I started lamisil the same day.  He used lamisil for 2 months with no unbearable side effects but started to have diarrhea badly and a week after that started_ discontinued the medicine.  It's amazing how little the doctors are aware of the side effects and seem inexperienced to handle.  My podiatrist had to look up in his medical book to see if lamisil could actually  case a rash - at first he didn't even think it was the drug!  No doctor wanted to see me.  My podiatrist told me over the phone to see my family doctor and my family doctor told me I should see my podiatrist.  It didn't occur to me until 2 weeks later to see my dermatologist who I wish I saw from the beginning.  My dermatologist said the industry is experimenting with a new topical treatment which seems to have promising results but won't be available for another 2 years.  I'll wait for that - no more internal medicines.,F,50,23  days,10/18/2006,Lamisil

I also noticed a slight weight loss and my sense of taste went away during the last 2 weeks of taking it.  Taste came back shortly after_ but so did my toe fungus.  I was going to take another 3 mos round_ but got pregnant.  I'm taking lamisil again and am having different side effects - around wk 4 started having headaches depression_ weight gain_ and lots of fatigue.  I'm extremely frustrated with the side effects and am not sure I can hold out another 2 months.  I also am concerned about damaging my liver.  ,The first time taking lamisil I experienced no problems and I would've recommended it to any person with a healthy liver.  This second round is an entirely different story.  I feel terrible on it! And I am seriously considering quitting the prescription.  This is a powerful drug_ but one also has to remember how difficult it is to kill a fungus.  If fungus was easy to kill we would all be using the topical stuff.

She discontinued the drug and_ when she had repeat liver function tests performed_ it turned out that her values were through the roof.  She's been off the drug for approximately 8 weeks_ but her alkaline phosphatase is still well above normal.  (Her other values are finally in the normal range.)  She has suffered_ and continues to suffer_ from loss of appetite (w/significant weight loss)_ severe exhaustion_ nausea_ chills_ itchy skin and bowel problems as a result of the drug.

I have not been without pain since starting this drug_ I have never experienced anything like this.  I am worried about taking not only lamisil but tyelenol_ excederin and motrin.  Majority of these posts complain about stomach and taste disturbance I would feel lucky to get that.,The nails are clearing and I have been on it for 6 weeks.

See comment below by gnomek@verison.net for more details.I have compiled a list of foods and how palatable they can be while recovering from the side effects of lamisil.  Perhaps they will help you find something you can enjoy.  Feel free to add more suggestions to the list.   If you want to taste something while waiting for your taste buds to recuperate_ I strongly recomment a tomato-basil bisque.  I got one from the Safeway recently_ and was able to eat_ and actually enjoy_ a whole bowl...With Bread!See panel to the right for more foods to enjoy_and avoid.,Lamisil and food:Avoid these:		Chocolate_ Cream based soups_ Doughnuts_ Coke/Pepsi_ cake.  Somewhat palatable:	Orange juice_ Grapefruit juice_ Milk_ Plain Yogurt_ spicy chili_ Ice cream.Actually have flavor!  Coffee(black and strong)_ Red Wine (not too much_ just 2 or 3 oz.)_Tomato-Basil Bisque (highly recommended)_ Altoids.If you have any other suggestions please pass them along.G.,M,47,37  days,6/17/2006Email,Lamisil

Eating is now as much fun as sucking rat puke from a sewer!!All food is just mush in your mouth..I put a teaspoon of pure sugar on my tongue and it was just wet sand to me!.I did`t make the connection to this horrible drug till i read all these stories with the same results..I stopped the crap at 40 days in and i am now off it for 12 days. I seem to be getting a tiny bit of life back in my tongue...slight tingling but no sweet taste yet.I have been gargling and swishing listerene every day and brushing my tongue too..I think this is helping the tongue spring back.I also took Buckleys mixture cough syrup for the sore throat. That stuff usually tastes like stale battery acid_ but i only tasted some mild chemicals...I just can`t believe how important taste is to life...we just take it for granted until it`s gone..I will NEVER take it again_ and will tell ANYBODY that it`s just not worth the risks to your liver and possibly your l,M,42,40  days,6/16/2006Email,Lamisil
844, 1, Fungal infection between the toes,My tongue is blind.  It can no longer discern sweet from sour_ salty from bitter.  Food smells wonderful_ but as soon as I bite into it_ it turns to cardboard mush.  Eating is a chore_ total drudgery_ when it used to be so sublime.  My depression_ such as it is_ cannot be blamed on my no longer enjoying the sweet sting of Wild Turkey trickling past my larynx_ but on the fact that I cannot taste a sweet anything going anywhere.  I stopped taking this awful stuff on June 9_ 2006 and am anxious to taste my food again (and drink a little Kickin' Chicken).  Can someone out there who has been where I am tell me how long I must endure my flavorless existence?  Please tell me I will taste again.,I have been living with this skin issue under the pinky toe of each foot for the past 15 years.  It occurs as a result of sweat creating a perfectly humid environment for all kinds of nasty beasties to grow_ and one of those is a fungus which lead to a bacterial infection_ and a big mess.  We've been treating it topically with Gentamicine_ Naftin and Betamethasone_ as well as systemically with Lamisil.  The Lamisil was a Big Mistake.  That stuff is nasty.  Had my doubts from the beginning_ but was willing to give it a chance until I lost all my sense of taste.  After 37 pills_ I'm calling it quits and will find something less intrusive.  I only have five senses_ and one liver and can't live a full life if I lose any of them.  On the other_ I have ten toes_ the least two of which I can just as easily do without.

846, 3, Toe nail fungus,I have been so depressed lately and blamed it on some family issues going on right now.  I am also tired most of the time.  That is so unlike me! I have also gained about 4 lbs. that I can't seem to lose.  I have blamed it on going out to eat with friends but once I get back to normal eating habits_ I usually lose it.  I have not been able to so this morning I went online to see what the side effects of lamasil are hoping that maybe this drug is to blame.  And it is!  Oh my gosh_ I cannot believe all the side effects!  It looks like the drug is to blame for the weight gain_ depression and itchy scalp.  I also have very weird dreams but I've had that problem for years.  Maybe the lamasil is intensifying that.  Now the loss of taste and appetite is something I have not experienced.  I have stomach problems due to IBS so I guess I can't blame that on the drug.  I want my toe nail fungus to go away but I don't think it is worth the problems I am having.,I have taken the drug for just over 2 months of a 3 month cycle.  I layed out a pill to take this morning but I am not going to take anymore.  I am quitting the drug today!!!!  I just hope I have taken enough to make the fungus go away.  I am going to take my chances.  I don't know why the doctor did not tell me about all this.  On the info sheet you get when you fill the precscription_ none of this is mentioned there either.  I am so glad insurance covered this and that I did not have to pay the full amount for the drug.  It is very expensive!  I am so looking forward to being my normal self again!!!!!

I will also at one point of time post pictures showing progress of the treatment.During the first couple of weeks me taking lamisil I had a lots of gas. Now I dont have gas but I use the bathrooms more often_ sometimes I go as much as 5-6 times in one day. At my 5th week of taking lamisil I have started to have weird dreams. Dreams that are so discusting and so weird_ yet so real_ that when I wake up in the morning or in the middle of the dream I feel so down beacuse of the dream_ and somethimes think the whole day about the dream_ because the dream was so messed up_ that only possibly can only happen in some of the SICK horror/thriller movies. Prior to taking lamisil_ I have rearly had dreams_ maybe one dream in few months_ and they were not bad dreams. N,M,25,46  days,6/5/2006,Lamisil

About 2 weeks ago_ my taste changed abruptly!  Had a very strong salty and/or bland or metallic taste_ mostly salty.  Drinking water_ tea_ soda_ etc. all tasted like drinking salt water.  All foods tasted either salty or no taste at all; anything sweet tastes horrible.  I read that this can happen.  Stopped Lamisil.  I'm frightened.  Eat very little; tastes awful.  Will I get my taste back?  What should I do to get my taste back to normal?  Help.  (Note: I emailed the above message to the company that makes Lamisil.  Within 24 hrs. I received their answer which is posted across from this message. I hope this helps those who have the same problem with taste change.  This is definitely not a ""less common side effect.""  It is a very common and upsetting side effect.",Regarding your inquiry taste disturbance is a side effect of Lamisil.  After stopping medication taste returns to 90% of patients in 12 weeks or less and 10% of patients it takes somewhat longer.  We do not have any actual time frame around the somewhat longer.To view available safety information on Lamisil_ please visit the attached link below.http://www.lamisil.com/info/tools/product.jspSincerely_Novartis PharmaceuticalsCustomer Interaction Center,F,53,9  weeks,5/30/2006,Lamisil

I kept taking the pill for about another 2 weeks.  Then I couldn't take the frustration anymore.  That taste is in my mouth all the time.  So I took the pill for 8 weeks and have now been off for 1 week.  Things are starting to taste better but taste appears to be dull_ not as vivid.  I hope 8 weeks will help my with my big toe.  I've had the infection for nearly 20 years.  Sandals in the summer_ what's that?  I paint my nails when they'll be visible so no one sees my left big toe.  What's it like to get a pedicure?  I hope 8 weeks will let me experience it.  I'm not particularly sensitive to medicines so this really shocked me.  I've also been more easily upset and weepy.

I have blood in my ejaculate.  I have not notice any in my urine as of yet.  I have not read any other comments pertaining to this_ but it must be related to the drug.

Tingling in my arms_ hands and across my chest_ ocassionally not all the time. Itching! I itch all over.

My half way liver test came back normal.,The toenail on my left big toe was so thick I used a little sander to thin it. I couldn't wear closed in shoes even in the winter_ it was too painful. When I got the courage to get the nail removed the doctor talked me into taking the Lamisil. My toenail is so much better I bought shoes and I can walk without pain for the first time in years.

Our doctor had her take Lamisil for one week and then not again for 3 months. This system of one week on Lamisil and three months off it reduce the risks and the side effects. After six months her toenail was completely cleared up. I recommend Lamisil without reservation. If you have doubts ask your doctor about this system of reduced exposure.

I am continuing topical treatment until big toes are fully grown in. I estimate that to be in about 2 to 3 months. BTW I used generic terbinafin from an internet Canada website.

Had no taste problems like others_ but did gain 13 lbs in 3 months while eating like a bird.  Had all sorts of stomach problems.  Decided to stop taking it the night I dreamed I was trying to kill myself.  I always had unusual dreams_ but they started being really dark and creepy.

Have been taking for three days and have lost interest in food and feel quite low and disconnected from my everyday life. This is obviously a extremely powerful drug - my doctor in Australia gave me no run down on the side effects.,I am a healthy fit mum of two who feels rotten after 3 lamisils.After reading other comments I am quitting them today.

888, 3, nail fungus,Awful disruption of taste and at times complete loss of taste at week 7 of taking Lamisil.,I was extremely worried after losing my taste.  I agree with many of the other comments related to this...it's so hard to explain_ but it does challenge one emotionally and physically.Here's some hope...my doctor did some research and found a University of Kentucky study which showed that 2.8% of the group taking Lamisil did experience problems with taste.  It further disclosed that the median time to recovery was 42 days.  My taste started to show signs of improvement at day 23 off Lamisil_ and now at day 30 it is much improved.  I hope this gives others some hope who are seeking something positive about how long they will have to deal with this awful side effect.When I didn't have any taste and didn't know if it would ever come back_ this medicine would get a rating of 1.  I have given it a 3 only with the benefit of hindsight...that my taste has improved and it appears it beat the fungus.  However_ I would not risk this side effect again...not worth it.

I also found that I had a difficult time sleeping on the drug and as a result of the drug and/or loss of sleep became anxious and slightly depressed. I'm a pretty confident person_ but I found after the first month I was insecure about things that didn't bother me prior to taking the drug.

Also have some weird nerve type pain in my chest...stabbing_ like pulling a bandage off.  I did have a bike accident a month ago so thought that perhaps this was due to that_ but it will be interesting if that also goes away.

The hives started behind my ears and less than 24 hours later_ is on my scalp_ my butt_ my wrists_ my ankles_ my waist and a few near my eyes. I didn't even presume it could be the Lamisil since it was nearly a month into the prescription. Judging from what I've read on this site_ this is normal. What a relief! My doctor is going to call me back today to try to figure out ""Plan B""_ but the current instruction is to not take the drug again.

It most especially affected anything sweet.  Sugar had NO taste at all.  I asked my podiatrist about this and he had never heard of it before with any of his other patients.  After stopping the medication_ it took about 4-5 weeks for my sense of taste to return to normal.,Obviously_ I did not continue taking lamisil for the amount of time prescribed by my doctor.

Isnt taste a neurological function? If an Rx can have this dramatic an effect in 3 days_ what will happen in 3 months? 3 years? Look_ the last thing we need is another Vioxx scandal.

Boy_ was I wrong. It took me 3 months to get my insurance (MVP) to actually get the expensive crap covered. FInally when I gave them all of the evidence I could supply them(short of cutting my damn toenail off and mailing it to them) I was able to pick up the medication.

Very healthy 48 yr old whoran marathons_ suddenly critically ill. Doctors have alreadydiagnosed lamisil-induced hepatitis & ruled out all forms ofinfectious hepatitis.

941, 3, Nail fungus on both big toes,After about 8 weeks_ I'm beginning to notice occasional bouts of fatigue and nausea and abdominal pains. Liver panels have been normal thus far (I get the liver tests more than usual).,Being a Nutritional Therapist and Wellness Consultant_ I do NOT like to take medications..... but since I've suffered from this infection for years and it started causing severe pain and nail deformity_ I decided to allow myself the 90 day protocol.  I was certain to get MORE than the necessary liver panel tests_ and I also made sure to 'support' my body with nutritional therapy and supplementation.  I do already see 'clearing' at the base of my nails for the first time in 5 years. You better BELIEVE that after this I will do ALL the right things to prevent future occurances!

943, 1, Big Toe fungus infection,It has taken 6 weeks for any major side effects of Lamisil. This caused me to do a google search and find this page. Over the past few days I have had neck cramps in my right side that has worked its way down my right arm resulting in pins and needles and numbness in my right arm and hand. It is very painful. I have also gained approx 0.5 stone in weight despite regularly exercising and never having a weight issue.

Also the bad taste is constant and gets worse the longer I go without drinking water (and then water will taste salty)  Am so thankful to know it is the Lamisil and stopped taking it two days ago.  Will  normal taste return?,I had taken Lamisil several years ago and had no problems and when nail fungus returned to one foot decided for another round of Lamisil - Do have some pink nail again but definately not worth risk of further complications.

Around the same time_ I also noticed some abdominal pain on my left side.  Doctor recommended I stop treatment and I requested a blood test at that time_ but I haven't gotten results from it yet.,I read all these comments before taking this medicine_ but figured chances are I would be okay and I would make sure to get frequent blood tests.  I am not happy that I will still be stuck with nail fungus_ but I do feel much better that I have stopped the medication.  I am going to try using Vicks VapoRub which many people claim works.

The nature of the risk of losing ones ability to taste is pretty much swept under the rug by the Lamisil manufacturer in its mass marketing of this dangerous drug.
