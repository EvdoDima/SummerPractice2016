1, 3, Stuffy sinuses_ sore throat,Jittery_ faster heartbeat,Didn't work until about four hours in_ so definitely not impressed with that. When it did work_ my nose still dripped but I didn't feel stuffy_ so I tolerated it. My throat was still a bit sore_ but I attribute that to the nasal drip which the Claritin-D did not do anything for. About six hours in I started to feel a bit jittery and my heart rate went up. I wasn't panicking about that_ even though I have anxiety (thank god I found this and could easily diagnose the cause of my jitteriness) but it wasn't very pleasant. I won't use this again; I'll probably just opt for some good ole nose spray next time my allergies decide to attack.,F,16,1  days10 1X D,6/26/2016,Claritin-d 24 hour

3, 1, Plugged ears_ mucus_ stuffy sinuses,I've taken this before over the past few years to help with allergies and I've always been fine. But this time was horrible. I couldn't sleep all night_ my heart was racing_ I felt nervous even though I knew it was from the medication. Now I've got a headache. I won't be taking it again!,,F,30,1  days,4/28/2016,Claritin-d 24 hour
4, 4, Allergies Hayfever,Now_ some insomnia if taken right before bed and after 3-5 hours of sleep. This wasn't the case initially.Sometimes the feeling of a small mucus lump in the back of my throat.,I've actually been taking the Costco generic (Allerclear) as it is much cheaper than Claritin D24.I only take it for 4-5 months in the spring and summer for hayfever. For the first couple of years I would take it at night and wake up feeling very well-rested unlike other allergy meds where I would have a very difficult time waking up.After using for a couple of years I would begin waking up after 3-5 hours of sleep and not be able to get back to sleep. Now_ I take it in the morning.It doesn't get rid of all of my hayfever symptoms but it does help quite a bit.I wish it wasn't as controlled so we could get several boxes at a time.,M,48,7  years1 pill 1X D,4/10/2016,Claritin-d 24 hour

I felt less side effects. I have a history of anxiety attacks and this lil pill was testing my limits.

8, 1, dust and pollen allergies,I first started taking this drug at Coachella in April where I experienced the worst allergies I had ever had. I could not breath and my eyes were swollen and crusted shut. Within a hour of taking the drug_ I felt immediate relief. My eye bags drained out and I began to breath. But I also felt hyper_ anxious_ and energized_ as if I had just drank a ton of caffeine. My eyes widened and I had a dry mouth. I also had a loss of appetite. The side effects came over me in waves- I would literally feel a rush of good and energizing feelings_ also slight nausea and dizziness_ come over me at various points of the day- like taking Molly. It's strong_ strong stuff. Later_ I experienced insomnia_ but I would try to take the 12 hr drug early in the morning so I wouldn't feel the effects by night time. I must admit that at first I loved the way this drug made me feel. I would get so much done_ as if I had taken an adderal_ and feel so alert and awake_ plus never had to deal with my allergy symp,"However_ I started feeling more insomnia and started having some anxiety attacks. I have had depression and anxiety before and can recognize the symptoms immediately. I felt down and ""weird"". I'd pace around my apartment feeling terrible and anxious and just cry. My dry eyes twitched. And when I would come down from the drug_ at night_ I would feel even more exhausted and hungry than normal. I became really dependent_ addicted- fearful if I did not take it I would not get as much done the next day_ or I would just feel to tired and not be able to breath_ so I needed more....I'd take an extra pill (12 hr) to go out at night to stay awake. I seem to have gotten used to the drug in some respects- It no longer gives me a jolt_ and I no longer feel good at all while I take it. Instead I am exhausted. I feel waves of exhaustion that just come over me. I feel like I am asleep but the drug is pulling my eyelids awake (and they twitch still). I feel depressed. I have been on the same birth control for years. But I think this pill does something to exasperate my hormones or my PMS symptoms. For the past 3 months being on Claritin_ my breasts have swollen up so large and been so painful during my ovulation until my period is over. It is so uncomfortable that I cannot even exercise. I have also been constantly constipated and bloated. I retain water. I have been exercising and eating healthy as always_ even overcompensating and eating less_ and I've still gained 5 pound",F,25,3  months 1X D,8/6/2015Email,Claritin-d 24 hour

I took it once and was up all night long_ feeling as if my heart was going to explode_ restlessness_ jitters_ headache_ hot sweats_ dry mouth.

28, 1, Allergies,I took Claritin-D for my allergies then ten minutes later I had a huge headache that wouldn't go away so I decided to take aspirin. Now I had done some research before_ if both shouldn't be taken together. There wasn't any big threats so I thought it'd be ok. Now within 30 minutes_ let me tell you how fast my heart was beating. It was literally pounding out of my chest. I already have really bad anxiety attacks_ so low and behold... my mind starts panicking and I'm on the floor feeling like my heart is going to just pop out. I'm not sure if both of the medicine made it worse? but I have taken Claritin-D before_ and it has given me the same symptoms as I had today. It was just 10 times worse today. I felt like my head was floating all day_ very dazed_ every time I stood up I would fall back down from being so light-headed_ had negative energy to do even the most simplest things. I just slept for a few hours and I still feel sick to my stomach. I hope this wears off soon................,Never taking again.,F,24, 1 1X D,5/31/2013,Claritin-d 24 hour

32, 5, Seasonal Allergies,Constant dry mouth_ occasional heart palpitations_ occasional insomnia_ occasional ED,I LOVE this stuff.  I used to live in a constant congested_ foggy state during May-Sept allergy season.  Would get debilitating sinus headaches especially if I drank any alcohol.  But now I take the 24 hour Claritin-D every day and feel great.  You MUST drink a lot of water EVERY DAY.  And I give up coffee once I go on the allergy meds or I get heart palpitations.  But it works so well for me that I got a prescription from my family physician so I can get 3 months worth at a time.  Yes_ there are side effects_ but for me_ they are FAR better than the allergies!,M,51,6  years 1X D,4/15/2013,Claritin-d 24 hour
33, 3, Itchy eyes_ nose_ and throat.,Claritin worked great for my allergies. I was in love with it until I started experiencing other unnatural woman problems. I could finally go a day without being miserable from allergies_ but my sex life was on 0 for an entire week. This isn't like me and my bf was kind of concerned as well as myself. I was just having vaginal dryness_ which made anything sexual unpleasing. I thought it was a coincidence_ but then I found that a few other women were experiencing the same problems! If you are a woman without a sex life_ I'd recommend claritin any day. Maybe it's my fault for not drinking enough water while on this medication_ but either way_ it's my only complaint.,,F,20,3  weeks10 mg,2/16/2013Email,Claritin-d 24 hour

It also did wonders for my allergiesI could finally breathe. After 3 wks of being on it though_ all the negative side effects hit. The deal breaker was the plummet in libido.

I took my first claritin the other day as I have been really stuffed up in the mornings due to possible allergies. I took the first one at about 5pm and then went to my jiu jitsu class at 6:30pm. Best class I've had in a long time - I was energetic_ excited and basically high. I couldn't sleep very well that night_ was restless and unable to deeply sleep which is highly unusual for me.

43, 1, year-round allergies,It works SO well for allergies_ and I enjoyed it as an appetite suppressant. But I finally realized that it's been responsible for painful vaginal dryness (sex was almost impossible_ even using tampons was unpleasant)_ really bad mood swings and irritability (especially during PMS time_ which has never been a problem for me before)_ lower libido_ and a drastic decrease in athletic ability/performance (it's like I suddenly had no cardio conditioning or muscle strength despite working out intensely my entire life). Now that I've stopped taking it for a couple weeks_ these things are beginning to subside_ but now I'm horribly exhausted all day every day. I'm trying to compensate with caffeine_ but it's not really working (and I don't want to be addicted to that either!) So now I'm perpetually tired and suffering really bad allergy symptoms.  This is a dangerous product_ at least for some. They need better warnings about this stuff.,,F,26,2  years1 pill/day,7/10/2012,Claritin-d 24 hour

The biggie_ though_ was that after I stopped it_ my nose became so dry and caked with mucus that I have had to wet it and blow hard_ one nostril at a time_ into the sink several times a day.

55, 3, Flu/Cold Congestion,Extreme Bloody Nose,My very first time taking this stuff resulted in a pretty severe bloody nose. About two hours after_ I felt EXTREME pressure building up in my sinuses... and then it suddenly dissolved (more like 'popped')_ but that's when a huge gush of blood poured out of my nose and all over my shirt (I had absolutely no advanced warning or time to grab the tissues). A few minutes after that_ a giant bloody sack came out after that and the bleeding stopped. I swear it was the lining of my sinuses. I know it was from the Claritin because I hadn't had a bloody nose since I was 8 years old.All of that said_ it DID clear up the congestion. I think perhaps I had this reaction because both of my second molar's roots protrude deeply into my sinus cavity_ so if you also have that going on you might experience the same thing. Therefore_ I'd advise everyone to only take this when you absolutely cannot stand the congestion anymore... and to keep plenty of tissues handy_ just in case.,F,21,1  days10mg 1X D,6/25/2011,Claritin-d 24 hour

My heart pounded out of my chest and I felt as if I had taken a diet pill or some similar stimulant.  By nighttime my heart was still racing and it took my forever to fall asleep.

But my biggest complaint is that my store never has 12 hour only 24 hour and the drug DOES NOT last 24 hours_ it's absolute rubbish!  And to make it worse... You can't take anything else until 24 hours later...

68, 1, allergies,At first it really helped my symptoms.  I felt great_ I could breathe and it had the added benefit of making me feel more awake and less hungry (or so i thought).  Very recently I went to the hospital for severe shortness of breath.  It turns out that I was having heart palpitations.  Since I have never experienced this prior and I am still fairly young_ I can only attribute this happening due to the Claritin-D.,After stopping the med altogether_ I experienced exactly what some other people have mentioned-EXTREME fatigue.  The first few days without it I pretty much couldn't even get out of bed.  Even now_ about a month later_ I still do not feel like myself.  I still fatigue very easily_ and lately I've been having some really bad stomach problems.  I'm not sure if these are still residual effects of the Claritin or not.  Either way_ I would not recommend this product to anyone to take as a daily allergy med.

I was super stuffy_ trying to blow my nose all the time and nothing was coming out so I realized my nose was swollen again (I get a sinus infection about twice a year).

My heart at times would kick into overdrive and I would feel as though I was going to pass out.

I typically would take the pill in the PM (did not effect my sleep).  If I missed a dose_ I would wake up the next morning so unbelievably groggy.  Almost painful to get up and moving.  Additionally_ when I stopped taking Claritin D_ I dealt with a few days of these groggy symptoms_ along quite a bit of weight gain.

My breathing was severely decreased and my nose was so congested so I ended up taking it. The first hour or so I noticed that I could breathe again_ my dizziness improved (I have a balance disorder) and things were okay until I started to get all of the side effects. I was in major pain and got really cold and tired so I bundled blankets on top of myself and got comfortable (in some weird way I felt like I had the flu). Eventually I started to get a shooting pain in my left arm and my joints got progressively achy and then I got a bad case of vertigo which later on made me feel like I was falling. I eventually fell asleep and woke up in a puddle of sweat with a horrible headache and minor aches_ and the tingly sensation was still there.

I was the biggest contributor to the performance of SEX but not anymore_ I think the Claritin company is directly or indirectly the ANTICHRIST because without sex how can we procreate?

My wife hates it and is asking me to switch medications.,Claritin-D 24 Hour almost always relieves my sinus headaches. Once or twice per year_ I have to take an 800mg ibuprofen with Claritin to relieve the migrain-like headaches that are completely debilitating.  My allergies are so severe at times_ I cannot function without some type of antihistimine and decongestant.

Every day_ before Clariton D_ I would get off from work and be completely exhausted and need a nap.  Now_ I have so much energy to where I get off work and want to go do something and stay busy.  Its so strange!  Yesterday though_ I felt like I was on drugs.  I seriously wondered if the Splenda I used had crack in it!  After reading this site_ I now know that it was the Clariton.

It also seemed to cause a small heart murmur_ racing heart rate_ thyroid goiter (and therefore difficulty swallowing and hair loss)_ and shortness of breath when laying on my left side.  General malais that improved once off the drug.  Muscle fatigue.,Please be careful when taking this drug if you have a thyroid condition_ adrenal insufficiency_ or heart condition or if you develop these conditions while taking this medication.,F,28,3  years,4/22/2009,Claritin-d 24 hour
138, 3, seasonal allergies,After only 3 days of taking the 24 hr Claritin-D_ I started getting an intense_ fairly sharp pain at the bottom of my stomach. Then I felt cramps_ churning in my stomach and intestines. This lasted for about 12-15 hours after taking the third pill/third day. Early this morning I woke up without stomach pain. Since I was not taking anything else_ I am assuming the Claritin-D 24 hr is the culprit.,"I started taking the D 24 - recommended by my doctor (first time I ever took it)_ over the regular Claritin because the pollen count in my area was quite high. (My doctor could see the pressure building in my ears.) Normally I get itchy eyes_ runny nose. This season - itchy eyes_ pressure in the ears_ and my throat felt swollen.Maybe the stomach problems were coincidence......but I don't think I will take the chance again unless I am even more desperate.I am going back to Alavert_ regular strength. I had good luck with that before.I rated it a 3 because it does ""work"" (itchy eyes are gone)......like dropping a sledge hammer on your toe will work to take your mind off another pain.

139, 3, Seasonal allergies_ Pet allergies,I started taking Claritin D to help keep my pet allergies at bay. When I started taking the product I already had a slight cold. After using this medication since March 21 it seems that my cold does not want to leave. My congestion clears up for a little while then it comes back with a vengance and usually at night. It's suppose to work for 24 hours. Obviously_ that's not the case. I'm trying to ween myself of the medication but so far_ if I stop it really hits me. I also experienced dry throat_ sleepless night_ and for some reason_ it seems to have triggered my asthma which I haven't suffered from since childhood.,Side effects of this medication should be made perfectly clear to the consumer especially regarding long term effects.,F,35,27  days,4/16/2009,Claritin-d 24 hour

146, 5, I did have allergies...,Loss of appetite_ burst of energy_ dry mouth,I absolutely love Claritin-D! I used to use regular Claritin_ but last year my allergies were especially bad. I decided to try this stuff and I was extremely satisfied! I had just had a baby a few months before I started taking it and I was having trouble losing the baby weight. I started taking Claritan-D and I literally had to force myself to eat! Even pizza didn't appeal to me anymore! I ended up losing quite a bit of weight. I believe I was down to 90lbs for a while. Just a warning: This might only pertain to petite individuals (I only weighed 115 max to begin with_)but after taking this drug for a while it becomes very dificult to eat for days_ even after you have quit taking it. I would recommend that this drug be taken every other day or so to avoid this appetite malfunction. Also_ due to my starvation_ I was always in a bad mood.,F,22,14  months,3/17/2009,Claritin-d 24 hour

After looking at the other comments_ I think I might could add that I did notice I was unusually depressed this week (although my hubby was gone an extra long time) but I seemed to be easily upset over many lil things... but mostly I think it may be the medicine that is making me pee so much.,"In addition to the peeing alot_ I've also lost 8 lbs this week! I am on Weight Watchers_ but I've never lost so much at one time... this was concerning.... and I am figuring that afterall- I DID pee ALOT of liquid out!  I'm guessing it's this medicine.ON the upside:  2 nights ago_ after taking this stuff for @ 1 wk_ and before that_ I tried the Advil COld & Sinus_ I did start feeling intense heat & moisture & noises_ as if my ear was draining.  Perhaps it is doing it's job?  I do hope so_ and quick_ so I can lead a ""normal"" for me- life again soon! ;)",F,30,7  days,2/26/2009,Claritin-d 24 hour

I never made the connection- I lost a *ton* of hair while taking this drug- huge amounts of it wound up in my shower drain_ every day. I started to be able to see bits of my scalp (and I'd always had a lot of hair). I thought it was just getting older or some sort of genetic thing. I stopped taking claritin about 2 months ago- and the hair loss seems to have stopped! Now I just hope it starts growing back. I'm posting this for anyone else looking for info on this connection- if you're on Claritin D and suddenly losing your hair- bingo!

I got allergy shots for 5 years_ but still needed claritin in addition to the shots. The effectiveness wanes occasionally and I have tried allegra_ zyrtec_ and others with no significant relief of symptoms. All meds work differently for all people and the side effects vary widely from person to person.

It worked so well for my cedar fever (itchy watery eyes_ runny nose_ sore throat_ etc...) that I started taking it every morning.  This is probably the 5th or 6th time I've taken it and it may be the last. All of the sudden my heart started racing_ I got dizzy and my head got really tight. I think my heart has slowed a bit_ but my head still feels very strange. I'm at work and it's making it very difficult to get things done. I am not sure whether the relief from the allergies is worth this feeling. I will likely try the 12 hour instead of the 24 hour next time.,F,29,6  days,1/23/2009,Claritin-d 24 hour

You will never be hungry_ lose lots of weight_ become more moody_ people will think you're hooked on illicit drugs and you will be a person_ at any age_ with no interest in sex etc. My recommendation is never to take the Claritin d 24 hour_ unless you're having a severe allergic reaction.

For this reason I do not consider Claritin worth the loss of my hair.,F,27,4  years,1/10/2008,Claritin-d 24 hour

232, 1, Allergies - Year Round,Night Terrors and heart palpitations are what caused me to stop taking this medication.  Claritin-D worked wonders for my allergy symptoms but after taking the medicine for at least one year_ I started to experience periodic Night Terrors.  Maybe it would be best for me to describe it as an anxiety attack while asleep.  (I do not suffer from Anxiety Attacks during the day or any other time.)  Very different from a regular bad dream or nightmare. I would be asleep and suddenly I would see something coming towards me. I would scream and wake up feeling as if I were having a heart attack. I also had several experiences of me running out of bed.  Once at a hotel I was on my way out of my hotel room when I woke up enough to realize what I was doing.,It was an LCSW who asked me to experiment with my allergy medicine to see if it would have an impact on my night terrors. The results were astonishing.  No Claritin-D.  No Night Terrors.  Yes.  I even resumed taking the medicine because I could not believe that one pill could make such a difference.  Sure enough.....as soon as I resumed the medication_ the night terrors returned.   Nothing else has worked as well for my allergy symptoms but I'd rather have runny nose_ itchy eyes and scratchy throat than to deal with night terrors.,F,47,3  years,9/24/2007Email,Claritin-d 24 hour

It got that bad and I did not know WHAT was wrong with me. I was not sleeping_ eating and was irritated and anxious all the time. I felt sick_ completely out of it and exhausted. After I stopped taking the medication though after allergy season ended all of my negative symptoms and feelings stopped completely and I felt normal again. The therapist attributed it to my sleeping and eating normally. A couple of days ago I resumed it again for allergy season and the same symptoms have returned. Starts with chills_ fatigue and feeling detached and anxious. Now I have not been sleeping_ having restless sleep with very weird dreams if I do sleep for an hour or two and I have no desire to eat anything.

Symptons subsided after a few weeks on the medication.  It has been effective - I can breathe and smell again and rarely sneeze. When I stopped taking Claritin I started snoring.  Since starting the medicine again I'm no longer snoring.  I take the 24 hour D in the morning.  Insomnia goes away after a week or so.  I'm feeling more rested.  Was feeling very depressed prior to restarting the medication and have noticed a major improvement.  When taking Claritin before never noticed it having any effect on my emotional well-being though I have had bouts of depression over the past several years but that's more likely the effect of major life events.

""Withdrawal is characterized by increased sleeping and eating_ and depression-like symptoms_ often accompanied by anxiety and drug-craving."" I cannot add all of the details...there's just too much!! Please look it up on your own:I know this may be a stretch for some people_ but the illegal drug ""methampetamine"" (or ""meth"") is nothing more than psuedoephedrine; which is also the active ingredient in Claritin D. The process of making meth is merely the process of extracting pure pseudoephedrine out of Claritin D. My point is that the symptoms you are experiencing on and off this drug are the EXACT SAME symptoms of meth...ONLY with meth they are magnified. The question of whether this drug causes dependence should be a ""no-brainer"" considering the epidemic of meth addicts out there.","Meth is the most addictive drug ever concieved and here we are taking small doses of it to treat our allergies and then wonder why we have side effects and cannot stop using it without withdrawl. Meth's side effects include not being able to experience pleasure when OFF the drug because it inhibits receptors in the brain which could take YEARS to recover. It's logical to assume Claritin D would have the same effects_ only much less_ since you're getting a much smaller dose. BUT_ JUST THINK ABOUT IT!! Do some research and see the similarities; you people on Claritin D are describing ""mini-meth"" symptoms. After taking a class in college about illegal drugs and learning everything about meth_ I urged my husband to get off this stuff.

321, 1, Allergies,The drug (and other drugs with pseudo-ephedrine)worked well for about 10 years.  I would stop taking them from time to time for a few weeks or a month in order to let it clear from my system_ and then go back on again with good results.  I had no real complications or complaints during that entire time frame.  In 2000 I decided that I felt that I should not have to live my life on antihistine/decongestants_ and that I would just bear having the allergies.  Well_ actually_ my allergies seemed fairly contained since then.  Never really getting too bad.  HERE IS THE REAL PROBLEM THOUGH_ something was now wrong with me (chemically speaking)_ after being off of the drug for more than 6 months (and BTW I took no other drugs_ no recreational drugs either)_ I fell into a weird state of deep depression.  What was odd is that I was at the pinnacle of my career (at 27) and family life.  I just sold my company for several million dollars_ and I just had my first baby girl about 6 months before,Since that time_ I have been very ineffective in work life.  I have gone though the money I made from the sale of my business without being able to parlay it into a new successful venture_ which is primarily due to my depression_ my chidren (now 3 of them) have had to live with a parent who is on edge and grumpy 99 percent of the time. I love them_ and I feel worst for them and my wife having to deal with me.  I think that it may be a likely chance that these drugs screwed me up since I took them for so long (maybe brought on the MS too).  I don't know what to do anymore.  I am actually_ as we speak_ starting to take Claritin again to if somehow my problems will go away since I did not have these problems when I used to be on the drug.

Repeated Tues 8pm.  Wed same effects.  Wed around 6pm I struggled to complete a walk with my family 1/2way around our block.  Went home and rested to bring heart rate down (scared by this point) and difficulty getting air into lungs.  Arms began to throb and chest pains began an hour later.  It was intensely painful to breath_ pain beginning in center of chest + moving outwards.  Possibly the paranoia_ but I truly feared that I was having a heart attack.

I've had severe allergies all my life_ and chronic sinus infections that turn to bronchitis and pneumonia at least twice a year. Claritin-D has solved that problem! Of course_ I had also taken sudafed (OTC) pretty regularly for years_ and it never bothered me; I have a very slow metabolism_ probably due to my allergies but also undoubtedly due to my physical makeup_ normally I have trouble getting through any day without multiple naps. Clariton-D takes away the sluggish feeling_ gives me a bit more energy so I can get things done.

335, 1, Allergies,Depression Anxiety Mood swings,I have read the other posts on this site regarding the onset of depression while taking this drug or shortly there after. I have also noticed this problem_ i have been taking pseudoephedrine containing drugs as needed since i was around 13 years old and have had a depression problem from around that time! I do not believe it to be the Claritin but the pseudoephedrine. Pseudoephedrine is the drug that methamphetamines are derived from. If you search around the internet you will find that meth has almost the identical side effects of taking drugs containing pseudoephedrine. Methamphetamines have a devastating effect on the central nervous system_ one of which researchers are finding is the shrinking in size of the hippocampus. Strangely enough_ many studies are now finding that loss of hippocampal volume has been associated with depression. I truly belive that pseudoephedrine containing drugs are to blame for much of the depression in our society. If you don't believe me_ start asking pe,M,38,25  years,2/18/2006,Claritin-d 24 hour

I had been on prescription Zyrtec which worked great_ but no longer have health insurance_ so doctor's visits and prescriptions were getting too pricey.

I do feel more energetic_ not jittery though as some of the other raters are experiencing.  I don't have the stuffiness_ sinus pressure_ runny nose_ itchy eyes or sneezing.  I tried using Claritin regular 24 hr_ without the decongestant_ but find it doesn't help my systems at all_ so I went back to the claritin-D 24 hr_ and I am symptom free again.  I would suggest if you are going to try it_ just get the cheapest smallest quantity pack and see how you like it.

379, 1, allergies,dizziness_ severe depression_ dry mouth_ increased heart rate,the two biggest side effects--definitely depression and increased heart rate. the entire day_ my heart was racing_ and i was so depressed that even my friends were noticeably surprised at my own behavior (since i'm generally a laid back individual). it does_ however_ work like a charm on those allergies. but those two side effects are especially unnerving so i stopped taking it after a week.,F,22,1  weeks,4/30/2004,Claritin-d 24 hour

384, 5, Work Related Allergies,The only side effect_ which was a bonus_ was loss of appetite. Food lost its flavor and I was able to curb my appetite.  I lost about 30 pounds.,,F,31,2  years,3/30/2004,Claritin-d 24 hour
385, 2, seasonal allergies,First of all_ keep in mind that I was only taking the 12 hour dose_ in the morning. However_ I wouldnt be able to fall asleep until about 2AM being constantly restless and agitated_ and would only get maybe four hours of sleep total bc I was constantly waking up. After a while It would still take me a while to fall asleep but I could usually sleep atleast 5 or 6 hours straight. I had just moved so I thought that might be the reason and continued taking the Claritin. Also during this time I began to experience mild to severe depression_ sensitivity_ mood swings and anxiety_ which I am now glad to see was a result of the drug and not just me.,It took me a while to attribute the effects to Claritin until talking with someone whose 4 year old son was experiencing the same thing after just starting to take it as well. I started taking it after getting really sick as a result of my sinuses and after the sickness was gone my sinuses were a lot better and coincedently I started getting sick right as I stopped taking it (though I do not believe it was bc I stopped) Honestly_ it could just be that they appeared better bc I wasnt sick and now that I am I'm worse again. Either way_ I'd rather be stuffy and congested than have to deal with the sleeplessness_ fatigue_ and depression 24/7,F,20,5  weeks,3/20/2004,Claritin-d 24 hour
386, 3, Severe sneez_ itch eyes_ runny nose,Dry mouth_ thirsity_ and most uneasy feeling is that increased heart beat! I wish I didn't took this_ I would look for alternate OTC if I've known this possible side effect.,It worked wonder on all my symtoms_ and I am alert - that I like. But I don't care for faster heart beat. I am in excellent health condition and do not take any other medication. 5'3''@125LB,F,46,1  days,3/19/2004Email,Claritin-d 24 hour
