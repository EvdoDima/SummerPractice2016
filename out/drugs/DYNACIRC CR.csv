0, 2, lower blood pressure,extreme fatigue_ acid reflux_ blurred vision,I have become a sort of vegetable on this drug.  A once active_ life-loving 60 year old who now hopes she can cook dinner or walk to the mailbox.  And BP is only out of the danger zone_not anywhere near good.,F,60,2  months5 1X D,5/3/2010Email,Dynacirc cr
1, 1, high blood pressure,horrible joint pain_ fatique_ muscle pain_ headaches_complete loss of quality of life. It took 10 months and 3 doctors to finally figure it out. I thought I was dying_ horrible drug.,horrible_ awful_ should not be on the market. I google dynacirc and the side effects I was having were not listed. I had to google dynacirc SEVERE side effects in order to see what they were. I wish I could sue them for the year of my life that I lost.,F,50,2  years,7/22/2009,Dynacirc cr
2, 2, high BP,NONE,NONR,F,41,12  days,3/19/2008,Dynacirc cr
3, 5, Hypertension and Parkinson's,Occasional minor flushing of the face,Very consistent regulation of blood pressure though it doesn't quite last 24 hours and it needs to be taken twice a day. No interaction with PD meds. Much better than the ACE inhibitor lisinopril with regards to consistency and edema. Hopefully_ it will slow the PD progression as well..,F,63,6  months,3/15/2008,Dynacirc cr
4, 4, High Blood Pressure,Seems to do the job with no side effects.,,M,59,10  years,7/14/2007,Dynacirc cr
5, 4, Isolated Systolic Hypertension,None so far and I've been taking this medication for 2 months now.  It isn't quite as good as an ACE inhibitor_ but lacks all the nasty side effects that the ACE has (for me anyway),,F,66,2  months,4/24/2005,Dynacirc cr
