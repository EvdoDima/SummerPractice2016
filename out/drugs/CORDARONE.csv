1, 5, Ventricular Tachycardia,"Typical side effects for me are_ decreased Thyroid function leading to higher cholesterol. For this I need to take 100mcg of Orixine to increase thyriod function. I sunburn easily_ and must ""slip_slop_slap"" all the time. Cordorone may possibly causing retina problems in left eye_ not too bad though.",Have been taking 150mg (200mg tablet broken in 2. Half one day and a full tablet the following day)for 17 years. Had ICD fitted 5 years ago. Increased to 200mg per day_ as ICD was reacting more than I would like. After 2nd cathater ablation 2 years ago_ I have enjoyed a clean bill of health. Now taking 150mg/day (just in case). I'm now back into active physical sports. My cardiologist doesn't want to remove the ICD...just in case. I don't have a problem with that.I'm very sorry to hear that some folks have had problems with this medication. It has been good for me.,M,53,17  years150mg 1X D,8/1/2011Email,Cordarone
2, 5, AFIB AFLUTTER_ PE,None ascribed to this drug_ as others mentioned I have been prescribed additional meds at same time.  Halo during loading at 400 Mg.  Now at 300 Mg_ no halos.,The episodes of AFIB and Flutter have been reduced with this drug_ stamina returning to normal_ which did not occur with CCB or BB alone.  Also on Metaprolol now.  Had CV but that lasted only 3 days_ will try another after 5 months on cordarone.  The 3 days without AFib/Flutter were heaven on earth_ after 5 years of episodes_ this drug has been a second best thus far.,M,53,64  days,8/7/2008,Cordarone
3, 1, Prescribed after stent procedure,This medicine was prescribed for my Dad following placement of a stent in a blood vessel leading to his heart in March 2007. At the same time_ the heart doctor put him on metoprolol_ plavix_ vytorin and regular strength aspirin. Since that time he has not been the same person. He has had no energy_ tingling in his hands_ frequent urination at night_ tiredness_ cognitive trouble_ eye problems_ back pain_ dizziness when getting out of bed in the morning_ and more. This month his regular family doctor took him off of the vytorin_ did an ekg_ and faxed it to the heart doctor suggesting strongly that he be taken off of the amiodarone (cordarone). This doctor said that this is a DANGEROUS drug.,I've gone to various sites on the web and they've all mentioned that this drug should only be used in life-threatening situations. It is not to be used lightly and has many_ many side effects. I know that medication is probably necessary following stent procedure_ but I can't believe the amount that doctors prescribe to their patients. The heart doctor did his own ekg_ ordered a stress test and cardiogram. He did not want to take my Dad off the amiodarone_ but when my Dad asked how he was supposed to pass a stress test in his weakened condition_ the doctor took him off both it and the metoprolol. I'm sure he'll want him to begin taking them again after the tests. Don't know what to do in that case? Its only been a couple of days since he's been off of them_ and he already seems to feel better. He didn't have back pain today and the morning dizziness is gone.,M,75,16  months,7/24/2008Email,Cordarone
4, 4, Sustained VT,floaters_ blurred vision_ blue splotches (too much sun)_ halo vision_ increases INR (coumadin),This is a miracle drug_ I have been on almost all of the antiarrythmic drugs and none worked_ ICD kept going off_ until after my 2nd Ablation (that did not work) I have been on 300MG daily for the last year and I get all the test to make sure nothing happens but I am happy with the time that this medicine has given me without shocks from my ICD. If you want to talk or  some support give me a shout...,F,35,1  years,7/22/2008Email,Cordarone
5, 4, Atrial Fibrillation,None,Cured AF completely_ at the beginning with 200 mg per day (4 months) now with 100 mg.  Seems effective in my case.,M,55,9  months,2/18/2008,Cordarone
6, 1, A-Fib,Death,This drug killed me at the age of 72_ one month after I retired and three weeks before my 50th wedding anniversary.  It essentially napalmed my lungs over the course of a month.  Then I languished on a respirator for three weeks as one organ after the other failed due to its extraodinary half-life. My wife finally put me in hospice with a DNR.  I lasted 30 minutes.  Amiodarone is white-hot death.,M,72,30  days,1/30/2008,Cordarone
7, 1, Arrhythmia,My father was perscribed this drug for arrhythmia.  It caused acute interstitial pneumonitis and_ after putting him three weeks on a respirator_ it killed him.,Be advised_ this drug can kill you.  Hold your doctor's feet to the fire if he prescribes this for you.  If this advice saves just one person_ then Dad won't have died in vein.,M,44,30  days,1/25/2008,Cordarone

9, 5, VT,At higher doses I got halo vision and elevated liver enzymes. All doses cause sun sensitivity.,Miracle drug for me but it still makes me nervous.

10, 2, atrtial fibrillation,lack of coordination_ fatigue_ ataxia_ dizziness_ insomnia_ abnormal gait,This drug really did a number on me. I could hardly function after a few days on it. Driving_ walking_ even getting dressed in the morning became major challenges. It was very disorienting_ even frightening. Discontinued after about a week.,M,57,7  days,8/31/2007,Cordarone
11, 5, ATRIAL  FIBRILLATION,INITIALLY_ SEVERE CONSTIPATION.  RECOMMEND BREAKING THE DAILY DOSAGE INTO 3 SEGMENTS AND TAKING EACH PIECE AT THE MIDPOINT OF EACH MEAL.  THIS SEEMS TO REDUCE THE CONSTIPATION AND INCREASE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DRUG. LIVER TESTS SLIGHTLY ELEVATED AND BEING WATCHED BY MY PHYSICIAN.,FOR ME IT IS A MIRACLE DRUG ESPECIALLY SINCE ELECTRICAL CONVERSION WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.  THE ADDITION  OF  50MG TOPROL XL PER DAY ALLOWED THE AMIODARONE DOSAGE TO BE LOWERED TO 100MG PER DAY.  BEEN ON THIS DRUG FOR ABOUT 5 YEARS. AT BREAKFAST I DRINK PRUNE JUICE AND EAT ALL BRAN TO REDUCE CONSTIPATION.,M,67,1825  days,11/1/2006,Cordarone
