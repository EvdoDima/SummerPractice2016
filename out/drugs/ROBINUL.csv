0, 5, Excessive salivating,I have multiple sclerosis....have suffered excessive salivating for past 5 years....neurologist recommended Robinul which I have been taking 1mg in am and another in pm....I also take injection 3x weekly of Copaxone for MS....I am no longer needing to spit every 2 minutes since I started Robinul...this has been a blessing...,,M,46,1  months3mg daily,7/27/2016Email,Robinul
1, 5, Hyperhidrosis,Slight headache_ dry mouth,I have experienced extreme sweating since I can remember. My doctor suggested this medication for me and it works. I started with 1mg which didn't really work. I take 3mg when needed but you have to make sure you drink PLENTY OF WATER!!! Also_ when you take the pills_ make sure they don't touch your tongue. This will help combat dry mouth. Place them as far back on your tongue as you can and wash them down with water. I dink at least 20oz of water immediately after taking them and sip on water all day. This prevents the dry mouth ad headach. The pills last all day. I may need to take another 3 the next day. In the winter_  2 mg will suffice_  but summertime will require 3mg. Good luck_ hope this helps.,F,41,4  years3mg,7/10/2016Email,Robinul
2, 5, Hyperhidriosis (hands_ feet_ etc.),Dry Mouth_ dry eyes_ dizziness,Robinul changed my life. I suffered from having sweating hands and feet my whole life. My friends and family used to always make fun of me. I was embarrassed to hold hands with girls I've dated. But ever since I started taking ROBINUL_ the sweating immediately stop. It boast my confidence and made me feel good about myself. Yeah I get dry mouth and dry eyes from side effects but hey it's better than waking around dripping sweat and being afraid to shake your homeboys hands. I recommend Robinul to anyone who has Hyperhidriosis. I only take 2 MGs in the morning an hour before I eat and it covers me the entire day.,M,20,7  days2MG,5/21/2016,Robinul

4, 5, axillary hyperhidrosis,occasional dry mouth,I was initially prescribed Robinul as a teen when my hyperhidrosis was at its worst ever! Seriously it was awful_ and my regular doctors kept saying it was because of my clothing or some BS. Finally saw a different family doctor and she wrote me a Rx for Robinul without hesitation - life changing! The sweating calmed down in my mid 20s_ and without insurance for a long time I ended up discontinuing Robinul for a few years. Unfortunately when I hit 31 it kinda started back up again_ but since I (luckily) have health insurance again I now have a dermatologist who helps me keep the hyperhidrosis in check.,F,32,9  years1mg 2X D,2/28/2016,Robinul
5, 5, Hyperhydrosis,Dry Mouth_ Sore Throat,I would recommend this to anyone who struggles with sweating. I mainly just sweat on my face_ which is super annoying. From what I can remember_ I was always a sweater_ runs in my family_ so I was definitely looking for something to help with it. At first_ I took only 1mg a day_ just to see how it did_ and it wasn't enough for me. So now_ I take 3mg once a day_ and it works great! It leaves me nice and dry_ but leaves you with some serious dry mouth_ which I would take any day over sweating. Its definitely better to take it on an empty stomach_ it would work faster. This is a great pill and it works!,F,24,2  weeks3Mg 1X D,12/14/2015,Robinul
6, 5, Sweating problem,Robinul aka Glycopyrrolate is a wonderful medication to be used if you have an over excessive sweating problem. I sweat a lot (my arm pits_ my back_ face_ forehead_ palms of hands_ feet......basically all over). I tried everything from different deodorants_ to powder on my armpits_ rubbing alcohol under my arm pits to dry them out. I even got Botox injections in both of my armpits to stop the sweating ( Botox is only temporary and you have to get injections every 6 months and it's very expensive...$1_400 for the Botox injections). The Botox helped my sweating but 6 months later I began to sweat even worse than before. My dermatologist than suggested Robinul and prescribed me a Rx for 1 pill a day. Within 4 days my sweating was GONE!! No more sweaty armpit  stains_ I wasn't embarrassed to shake someone's hand_ my forehead and face no longer dripped when I was hot. It has really done wonders for my awful sweating problem. The medication is a bit expensive without insurance but with insurance it's about $1 per pill (depending on the pharmacy...Walmart is the cheapest) and I only need one daily. The only real side effect I experienced was dry mouth and dry skin but it's well worth it considering how bad I would sweat previously. I would highly recommend this medication to anyone who has has a sweating problem.  - PLA                    KEEP CALM                      AND              STOP SWEATING                #Non-Sweating ,It worked for me!,F,27,3  years,10/31/2015,Robinul
7, 5, hyperhydrosis,Dry mouth_blurred vision_ eyes feel strained_ painful urination_ headaches_ flushed face_sensitivity to sun_ swollen fingers and feet ocasionally_ and dizziness.,I have been on Robinul 13 yrs. It's been an awesome drug. I will Sweat in the air conditioning_ when I was first put on it I had extreme dry mouth_ and some blurred vision. I have fainted from being dizzy. I had a constant headache on and off (more on) for over a year. I experienced hard time urinatin. Within last 9mths I've have painful urination. The side effects can be rather annoying.

8, 1, Hyperhydrosis,headache_ dry mouth_ difficulty urinating_ constipation,"My doctor prescribed this for me when I clearly wasn't supposed to be using it_ because I have several of the ""don't take this if you have this...""_ he prescribed the other stuff so why give this to me as well? Doctors are not safe!! I've been trying to get off of this drug_ but I am having severe withdrawal symptoms. It's a very addictive drug_ but you don't realize it until you miss a dose or try to get off of it. I noticed it at first when I missed a dose.

9, 5, Excessive hand/feet sweating,Headaches_ dizziness_ dry mouth,I love Robinul because it seriously has changed my life. I used to sit in school and sweat so bad that I couldn't hold a pencil. In summer I couldn't wear flip flops because my feet sweat so bad they would slide right out of my shoes. The only complaints I have are listed above. I find it very hard to go to the gym because I get extremely dizzy there from dehydration I'm assuming which is worrying_ so I don't do my best. I also have been getting very cold lately_ to the point where I'm almost always in pants/sweatshirt even in summer. Has anyone else had these issues?,F,22,1  years1 mg,7/21/2015Email,Robinul
10, 5, hyperhydrosis,Dry Mouth_ sore throat,This drug cured my excessive sweating within hours of starting it. I've only been taking the generic glycopyrrolate for 5 days but it's helped so much. Dry as can be. The side effects are annoying. Dry mouth happens sometimes and the sore throat too but other than that it's so worth it to get rid of excessive sweating problems.,M,24,5  days4mg 2X D,7/20/2015,Robinul
11, 4, Only for underarm sweating,Depends on the dosage. Very dry mouth_throat_nose and eyes. Bloating. Dizzyness headaches  and confusion,Although this has worked very well_ especially when I take 3 or 4 1mg tablets daily. The side effects are quite worrying as my body must be so dehydrated. As soon as I drink water my mouth is instantly dry and I worry about getting heatstroke and being unwell while in the gym. But 3mg seems to be the best dosage atm so I am very happy with the results,F,22,3  years1mg,7/6/2015,Robinul
12, 5, excessive sweating,Dry mouth_ dry throat,Has been a life safer.  About 6 or so years ago_ I started sweating profusly. I have had medical issues and take many medications.  The sweating was annoying to me.  Then started generic Robinal and the sweating has stopped.  I take 1 -2 per day depending on my daily activity or appointments.  It has been worth taking for me.,M,62,5  years2 mg 2X D,6/15/2015,Robinul
13, 5, hyperhydosis-excessive sweating,I haven't had any yet. But it has been a life saver. I suffer from hyperhidrosis my whole life.,I have had the ETS surgery where they cut the nerve to stop sweating on my hands. I had bad compensatory sweating on my whole body. This has curved it by at least 75%. The generic is very affordable and works well also.,M,38,1  years2-3mg 1X D,6/12/2015Email,Robinul
14, 5, Palmar & plantar HH,On 2MG I experienced really really dry mouth and dry eyes. It' was very difficult to wear contacts while using 2MG dose so I would wear my glasses. I decreased my dosage to 1MG every morning and my eye and mouth dryness is much bearable. Noticed this stuff causes my stomach to make strange noises and also regulates my digestion.,i've suffered from HH since I was 12 or that's as far back I can recall that I was conscious of it. I remember hot summer days at school with no a/c and my hands would leave imprints on the desk_ it was so embarrassing. I was always conscious of the shoes I bought_ always afraid of sliding out of sandals or heels or ruining the material from my constant sweating. I am 28 now and  this stuff is LIFE CHANGING!! I wish I could've discovered this a long time ago. I suffered for so long and it's definitely affected my social life. Although Robinul is not a cure it works and it gives amazing relief! I will definitely be taking this for as long as I can. Going to keep spreading the word on HH boards about this stuff.,F,,30  days1MG 1X D,6/5/2015,Robinul
15, 5, Excessive sweating,Dry mouth in the beginning_ then it went away.,"This medicine saved my life. I've been dealing w/excessive sweating after my son was born 9 yrs ago. I asked my Dr about it and was told my ""hormones were still high because I had given birth"". I didn't bother asking again b/c it wasn't bad in the beginning. It's gotten progressively worse through the years. At night I'd wake up drenched. My hair would be wet from night sweats. I once took my son_ who was then 2_ to an amusement park with a friend who also had a 2 yr old. As we stood in line _ sweat just poured from my face_ neck. I looked around and I was the only one sweating. At my baby shower with my second son_ I was constantly dabbing at my face while opening presents. For some reason I still never thought to inquire about it. That changed this spring when I started school.  I had to go on campus for training and by the time I got to the room I was sweating pretty hard. I went to the ladies room to freshen up but I could still smell the sweat when I got to the training. If I could smell it_ I knew they could too. I immediately called my Dr and set up an appointment. She put me on generic Robinul.I love it! I have had no side effects_ thankfully. My confidence has taken a boost as well. I would have probably dropped out of school since my major is not online. I couldn't have imagined going to class reeking of sweat. Thank God for Robinul!",F,45,1  months2 mg,5/25/2015,Robinul
16, 5, general hyperhidrosis,dry mouth when taking over 2mg,All these comments helped me a great deal with my HH and the choice of taking every step to get hold of this drug (not available in my country). So I'm returning the favour and I want to share my experience with you. I have suffered from general HH since ever. I'm not a severe case_ but it made my professional and social life hell. i've tried for years every possible drug_ but nothing worked 100%. i had to mix different medicines and do a lot of preparation before a potentially scary event. all this until i decided to give Robinul a try. That was a turning point for me. I had nearly lost any hope before trying this lifesaver drug: it works so well and has never let me down that I am literally enthusiast about it. It does give you mouth dry_ but for me only when I go over 2mg. If I stick to 2mg is perfect and if I need to prolong the effect_ I take another 2mg but not before 10-12 hours after the first one. It's crucial that you take it at empty stomach_ otherwise it would not work. I usually set the alarm like 5-6am early to get one and go back to sleep for another 2 hrs before having breakfast. Then_ if needed I take another one in the early evening. Go easy with alcohol especially during the summer_ as there's risk of dehydration if you're not careful. I've made that mistake myself and it's not pleasant. I'm sorry for those of you who don't see any tangible benefit_ try and review what you have been doing_ take it far way from meals and understand what's the best dosage for,M,39,1  years2mg 1X D,3/7/2015,Robinul
17, 1, Palmar Hyperhidrosis,Dry eye_ dry mouth that went away after stopping the medication. Also suffered severe belching and bloating/abdominal distention after eating or drinking that never went away after stopping the medication!!!,DON'T TAKE ROBINUL IF YOU HAVE CHRONIC CONSTIPATION! I went to a dermatologist in May 2014 for treatment of my hyperhidrosis on my hands and feet. I was initially seeking Botox but the dermatologist want me to try first Robinul/Glycopyrrolate. I first took 1 MG and it didn't do anything_ but 2 MG made my hands completely dry. At first my only side effects were dry eye and mouth_ but on the third day of taking it I developed severe belching along with bloating/abdominal distention after eating or drinking to the point I looked pregnant. I was working at my city government for an internship_ and I had to shake a lot of people's hands_ so I continued to take it for about a month until I couldn't put up with the bloating/distention anymore. Except the bloating/distention and belching never went away!  8 months later I still look pregnant after eating one meal_ even drinking a glass of water makes me bloat! Why did this happen? I already suffered from chronic constipation_ and information about the drug says it slows GI motility and relaxes the stomach and intestinal muscles. So I guess I was susceptible to the worsening GI effects of the drug. Frankly_ I wish I had never taken it because it's made my life miserable!!!!,F,22,6  weeks2 MG,2/18/2015,Robinul
18, 5, excessive sweating on head/face,slightly blurred vision_ drowsy in the evenings.  That's it!,Have been sweating profusely since I was an infant.  Using drysol (in a dobber) for a year and stopped my hands and feet permanently from sweating.  My head/face have now found the same result.  This is amazing.

19, 5, Hyperhidrosis,Slight dry mouth but other than that- amazing results! I have had hyperhidrosis my entire life (hands_ feet_ underarms_ groin) you name it_ it would sweat...all the time! I had taken this drug a few years back and it only lasted about a month then stopped working. I decided to give it a try again a few months ago and it has changed my life!! When i had taken it before i didn't know much about how to take it. This time around i did research and learned that it is most effective when taken at least 1 hour before eating. I had to play around with how many pills i needed per day and finally found that taking two 1mg tablets in the morning will last all day! Unless it was super hot then i would take another in the afternoon and be sweat free! This medicine is a life saver! I would recommend anyone trying it to give it time and experiment with multiple ways to take it because it really does work now that I've found this routine!,,F,24,4  months1mg,10/24/2014,Robinul

21, 5, Hyperhydrosis/ hands and feet,Dry mouth and dry nasal passages,I wrote a review two years ago but thought I would give an update. It still works great! I still take it twice a day_ morning and night. It works best if you take it at least two hours before eating in the morning. I don't worry anymore about my hands sweating while taking this medication. In my other review I talked about all the treatments I have done. Nothing came close to being as effective as Robinul. The key is finding what dosage works for you. My life has drastically changed since taking it. I no longer avoid situations where my hyperhydrosis might embarrass me. Any side effects I have had went away after a few weeks. This is a great drug for managing hyperhydrosis.,F,32,2  years2 mg 2X D,8/6/2014Email,Robinul

Without it I would avoid social events or chit chatting with neighbors. Which made me so anti-social.  I take 2mg on days I know I would have to go out.  I get dry throat but I suck on Halls and it helps me a great deal.  Don't take 2 doses at once_ just space them out through out the day for very hot days.  Take one dose in the morning on an empty stomach_ 1hr to 2hr before eating.,,F,37,10  months2 1X D,6/28/2014,Robinul

It's only been 1 week but it definitely seems like a keeper. Even with intensive exercising and cardio workouts-I haven't felt dizzy or lightheaded! I used to sweat so bad under my arms that I'd have to change my shirt & bra about 3x per day_ and any other color besides black? forget it! Since taking Robinul_ I've been able to wear any color I desire and any type of shirt (I would wear loose fitting T-shirts to try and minimize the underarm circles) I'm extremely pleased with my results thus far and hope that it continues to be as effective. For now_ I may stick with the 1 MG pill in the morning and add 1MG in the evening if necessary!

35, 5, Hyperhidrosis severe,Headaches_ dry throat_ dry eyes_ occassional bloating_ occasional fatigue,Robinul really works! I've been suffering with hyperhidrosis all my life (am 30yrs old) and have tried Botox and dry sol to no avail. My dermatologist suggested I take 1mg of Robinul /day. It had no effect on me. he suggested I try 1mg in the morning and 1mg at night. I instead decided to take 2mg in the morning; it worked but for only 3-4hrs. I tried taking 3mg but the side effects were too severe for me; it would hurt every time I ate and my throat would be so dry I could barely talk.So I went back to 2mg and tried_ as someone suggested in this site_ to take it on an empty stomach. And BINGO This worked! I take it as soon as I wake up in the morning and then I do not eat or drink anything for 2-3hrs and I must say  it works wonders! I feel like a normal sweat free person. It has the effect of eliminating my sweat for about 10hrs - 12hrs with very minimum and tolerable discomfort. I can use my contacts and i can even now wear clothing other than black. sometimes I get headaches in the morning and my nasal passages get really dry especially if it's cold out but it's nothing I can't handle. Tip: your throat becomes very dry especially after not drinking anything for the first 2hrs after taking the pill. Drink something warm like tea or coffee to avoid pain when eating your first meal in the day. If I take it for 3 or 4 days straight the side effects do become less severe.

36, 5, Excessive sweating (head),Dry mouth and nasal passage,Generally I would wake up in the morning with my pillow drenched in sweat and it seemed everywhere I'd go I'd be dripping sweat_ even in cooler weather. From the first day I took Robinul I woke the next morning completely dry!My initial doses I was given was two pills in the morning. Unfortunately by the third day I had a strange taste sensation and my mouth became excessively dry. I was eating breakfast and it became impossible to chew and swallow without taking drinks between every couple of chews and then to assist swallowing. It was initially a let-down_ but I noticed that this subsided by that afternoon.I consulted with my dermatologist that prescribed me the medicine and suggested that I try reducing the dosage to one or 1 1/2 a day_ or the two but taking only one twice a day. There were still a couple of onsets of what I had the third day of taking the medicine_ but it looks like I've finally got it down for me.I now take one pill a day_ and I take it at night before going to bed instead of the morning. I haven't been experiencing the extreme mouth dryness_ I haven't been dripping sweat or waking up with my head soaked in sweat. Currently I seem to only break a sweat when doing more strenuous activity such as exercise_ which is actually the time you want to sweat.

44, 5, Hyperhidrosis of the hands and feet,Dry mouth and dry nasal passages,I have suffered from hyperhidrosis of the hands and feet since around the age of 9 or 10. I am now almost 30. I have tried drysol_ Ionotophoresis_ and botox injections in my hands. None of these treatments gave me the dryness I was striving for like Robinul. I take 2mg in the morning around 6 or 7am on an empty stomach and I don't eat for 2 hours. I then take 2mg again on an empty stomach before bed around 9 or 10pm. I did have some side effects of dry mouth and dry nasal passages that went away after about 2 weeks. I do have some minor difficulty in urination but only slightly and hardly that noticable. I wouldn't even call it an issue at all as I'm still able to fully urniate. These are the only side effects I have experienced. For the first time in my life I can go out in flats_ heels and sandals and not worry about my feet being obviously sweaty. I can also shake hands with people and not worry about them sweating. I also exercise and still sweat. My back and face will still sweat but my hands are still dry. My feet will still sweat when exercising but I think it's mainly because I am wearing socks and inside a tennis shoe. Once I take them off my feet dry right up. I would definitely recommend this drug for anyone suffering from hyperhidrosis.,F,30,1  months2 mg 2X D,5/7/2012Email,Robinul

46, 5, Excessive sweating,Dry mouth_ sore throat_ headaches (may be due to Enbrel or combination of both) and oddly in the last 2 weeks I have had a sore throat and the feeling that I have something caught in my throat.  I've coughed_ tried my best to clear it_ and drank as much water as possible-upwards of 100ozs per day like always) to no avail.   One time I was able to cough up mucous which was thick and awful tasting.  I am unsure if I am getting some type of virus and this is the beginning or if this is due to Robinul and dry mouth etc.  It has lasted for a couple of weeks and I have not gotten sick_ so maybe due to the crazy winter we've had it is allergies like everyone else in the area_ only I don't typically suffer from seasonal allergies.  I may have to back off the dosage and see if that alleviates this problem for me.  Even if it doesn't I will not stop taking the medication as it helps with my sweating so much.  If anyone has had this sore throat_ feeling like something is caught in your throat fee,This medication has drastically reduced my sweating_ and as everyone else here has noted I can live normally now.  I even wore a gray t-shirt-which I ALWAYS avoided like the plague before.  I still have some sweating but it is what I would consider normal sweating like if I am working hard or in the gym.    I take adderall also which I think contributed to my sweating_ even though the dr said it's not listed in the side effects_ and even when I take the full dose I do not see the terrible sweating.  I used to avoid taking a full dose of adderall due to the sweating but now I can take it and not worry about sweating_ so it has not only helped the sweating it has helped me take the adderall I so dearly need to function making this a double win for me.,F,31,30  days2mg 2X D,3/3/2012Email,Robinul

48, 5, Excessive sweating generalised,dry mouth_ dry skin,This is the tablet I have been seraching for!  I have suffered with hyperhydrosis for 20yrs and tried ALL sorts to cure it.  This tablet is amazing and has thankfully enabled me to have a normal life. I dont think people realise how debilitating this condition is and how it has a massive negative impact on life. This tablet stopped my sweating completely after 2hrs of taking it and lasted all day!! (TAKE ON EMPTY STOMACH) Its a God send and only wish I'd known about it earlier. But better late than never. I'd recommend this to anyone with this condition as the side effects are nothing compared to the effects of hyperhydrosis.

49, 5, head/forehead sweating,Intense Dry Mouth_ sore throat,After reading comments from you all about a week ago_ I cross-referenced Robinul on various sites_ read doctor testimonials that assured me this was worth a shot_ and although I may be speaking prematurely_ this is the greatest drug out there_ no questions asked.  I was so pumped to read that this type of drug existed_ I texted a buddy of mine_ a dentist_ had him call in the Rx_ life's been better ever since.  I'm truly upset that it took me this long to uncover a solution_ and I have you all to thank.  You're my Santa Claus this year_ so thank you from the bottom of my heart.As far as symptoms_ like many of you_ my scalp & forehead would sweat.  It could & would happen at any time_ but most often at the least appropriate times (meetings_ dinner table_ close quarters_ etc.).  And as I've read from many of you_ there didn't seem to be a way to stop the sweating.  From there_ I'd almost develop a panic attack.  And no_ the SSRIs didn't help_ although my stint with Paxil was a short one.  The past 5 years have been rough_ it's actually gotten worse over time_ and now I see there's an answer for me.  So thank you for your suggestions.  I feel like a new guy_ no fear_ no worries.  I start with 2 mgs early AM (7 am)_ then I go with 1-2 mgs later in the day (between 2-3 pm) depending upon the ensuing situations I'll be in.  I couldn't be more pleased.

52, 5, Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating),Dry mouth,To quickly sum it up_ if you have problems with excessive sweating....Robinul may work for you as well as it has for me...I couldn't be happier.Long story.....I've had problems with excessive sweating for 20 years.  Anytime that people around me might be sweating too_ I would literally be dripping.  And I would always be the first to start sweating.  Those situations never really bothered me though as I just laughed it off and it was normal to be sweating then.Over the past few years though_ there were times that I would start sweating in business meetings...and the more serious or stressful the meeting_ the more I would sweat.  I'm in sales and routinely close very large deals and it was never a question of nerves or confidence.  I went to my dermatologist and asked about beta blockers as I thought it was a problem with adrenaline.  She instead suggested Robinul and I'm so glad she did.The prescription she gave me was for 2 mg once a day.  What I've found though is that as a previous poster mentioned_ the medication doesn't need to be taken every day.  I also found that 2 mg wasn't really enough for me.  So_ what I do now is take 4 mg on the days I have big meetings and am worried about sweating.  And it works amazingly.  I do get a really dry mouth_ so I always carry a water bottle into meetings with me....but it is so much easier to explain a water bottle than it is to explain why you're sweating during a big presentation.  ,M,40,4  months4 MG 1X AN,9/28/2011Email,Robinul

No longer do I feel uncomfortable or worry about smelling like sweat_ when I am around other people_ and no more comments like ""are you alright""_ when people see me sweat.

56, 5, Severe Hyperhidrosis,Dry mouth and sore throat.,The type of hyperhidrosis I have is generalized and sweat just drips off of me. I have been living with severe hyperhidrosis for 11 years now and it has only become progressively worse as the years have passed (especially since moving to a much warmer and humid climate less than 6 months ago).  After speaking to maybe 5 doctors_ including a dermatologist_ my most recent physician agreed to try me on this drug.  I have been taking this medication for 4 days now and since the 2nd day it has worked like a charm.  I take 2 mg_ twice-a-day.  A number of patients suggested to take the medication on an empty stomach and I found that to be most helpful.  First thing in the morning I take it and then at night before bed.   I wish I had known about this medicine a long time ago_ but I am so grateful that I stombled upon this website while doing research on medications used to treat this condition.  I can not even remember being this dry and it  is indescribable.  It may take me a while to get used to the idea of not having to choose my clothing based on concealing the sweat; not having to constantly check to see if the sweat is noticeable; and so forth.  I do experience the dry mouth and therefore a sore throat at times.  To combat that I drink plenty of water and bought some cough drops.  Hopefully I do not have to experience it for long_ but if I do I will have to live with the side effects because I never want to go back to how I felt before. Thank you reviewers!

I have had it for about 4 years now_ and have tried every treatment out there besides the ETS surgery_ which I have tried my hardest to stay away from. I would consider my Hyperhidrosis on a scale of 1-10 being the worst_ as a 10. I was hesitant on taking Robinul because of the side effects_ but to me_ dryness of mouth and eyes (which is not very bad) is alot better than my hands_ feet_ armpits_ and facial sweat.

Twice.  It got rid of_ for a while_ my frown lines but did nothing for my sweating.  I went to the dermatologist_ and he said he wished I had come to him before spending so much money on Botox.  He said Robinul has a good success rate.  To make a long story short_ I started taking it_ and at first_ was taking it twice a day.  I read where one guy had success taking three pills once a day so I tried that.  It is amazing.  I still sweat_ but now_ it's like a normal person sweats.  I don't sweat for no apparent reason_ and when I do_ it stops when I go inside where it's air conditioned.

63, 5, Hyperhidrosis,Dry mouth_ dry nasal passages_ reduced bladder urges_ dry eyes.,I'll just say that for me Robinul is everything I'd hoped it be. I am really completely dry now after suffering from extreme entire body (mostly face) sweating. Some of my work includes sales and I cab say that I am much more confident now that I do not have to sweat like a crazy person.I'll give a few pointers for use that I have learned:First_ these pills dry up anything they touch including your tongue. So when taking them_ get them as far back in your throat as possible to prevent them touching much of your tongue. This will significantly reduce dry mouth side effects.Second_ if you feel like you need to go_ do not hold it. This pill will relax your bladder and you won't feel the pain you normally would if you were holding it without the pill. This is important because holding it is not good for your bladder and can lead to side effects such as over active bladder etc...Dosage: I am a pretty big dude at 250 lbs_ I find that 2 mg in the morning lasts for 11 hours_ but takes about 2 to start working and gets stronger until about 6 hours at which it begins to level out and then diminish. This means I get about 9 hours of effective use and about 6 at full strength. If I take first thing in the morning I am covered for the work hours in the day and am happy.  I think it will depend on the individual but this is what works for me. Stop waiting. Go see your doctor and see if Robinul can help.

I was mortified over and over and finally decided that I was NOT going to leave my doctor alone until there was a cure or at least help with the issue. After having just had lab work done and knowing my thyroid was okay_ my doctor said that the sweating is likely due to anxiety.  He suggested a anti-depressant. I was already on one for depression.  So he said the next step was to see a dermatologist. I thought it sounded strange but was willing to do anything for help with the issue! When my dermatologist told me there was medicine to help_ I almost cried! It started working very quickly and I am reminded how well it works if I let my prescription run out.... the sweating returns pronto! I take 1 mg but I take 8 a day. The dermatologist said that this is the absolute limit (even at my current obese weight- I had hyperhydrosis even when I wasn't overweight) because of potential dangerous side effects. Notably_ the inability to urinate_ therefore hurting/shutting down the internal organs.  Even with the above mentioned risks_ I would not stop this medicine for anything!

81, 4, Very Bad Hyperhidrosis,Horrible Dry Mouth_ Some difficulty urinating because this drug relaxes the bladder muscles_ Now 4 yrs later having issues with my bladder very overactive bladder trying to figure out why- and possible cause may be this!!! :-(  This is an all the time thing too not just a side effect while on drug but mostly likely caused by this medication.,Have been suffering from hyperhidrosis since early teens or at least that is when i realized it. Has ruined my life horribly. Cant stay in class(college) without breaking out in horrible sweats. Problems with relationships_ careers_ and everything else that involves being in a social environment which is basically doing anything!!! All of u who suffer with me can all relate to what a horribly embarrassing life that this is! This medication I had to find out about and tell my doctor cuz all doctors suck and know nothing about hyperhidrosis. So since i brought it to his attention he resaearched it and decided to prescribe it and basically experiment on me. Yes this drug was sent from heaven. It clearly will make ur sweating 90% better while on if not 100%. If anyone takes this and says it doesnt work its probally cuz ur not taking it on an empty stomach. Cuz i have found thats the way it works BEST! I take it First thing in morning and i wont eat again until a good 4-5 hrs after i take it! You will also feel the horrible dry mouth set in. But I warn all that 4 yrs into it I am now having bladder issues at only 23 and i am feeling like i always have to urinate even when i dont. Hoping the nerve disorder we suffer from hasnt gotten worse or that simply the medication isnt wut is doing this. Cuz u must kno this drug clearly is having affects on ur bladder! and yes most say u'll do nething not to sweat and i felt the same till now cuz can u imagine having overexcessive sweating and,M,23,4  years2 MG 1X D,7/22/2010,Robinul
82, 5, Severe facial and body sweating,Moderate dry mouth_ minor headache,This drug is amazing. For the last 15 years_ I would sweat uncontrollably at any temperature over 75 degrees or in any social situation that was even the slightest bit uncomfortable. I just started taking Robinul (actually Avert which is the same) last week and I have not dripped a drop of sweat since. For me it was literally just like turning off a switch. The side effects are mildly irritating_ but from what I've heard_ they get better. For me_ this is as close to a miracle drug as I've ever seen.  ***** Seriously_ though.. take the doctor's advice and start with a low dosage_ then work your way up as needed. I thought I'd start at 4mg per dose instead of 2_ it was definitely too much for me.,M,26,1  weeks2 2X D,7/21/2010Email,Robinul

I've also been using 'Driclor' on my hands which I think has also helps however it does dry out my skin quite a lot so i dont use it all of the time.

87, 5, Excessive sweating: hands/feet/pits,Dry mouth_ dry nasal passages,I have been experiencing excessive sweating since I was in elementary school.  I was told it was genetics since my siblings have it too.  I have tried Drysol but it made my hands/feet cracky and dry and my underarms stung because I shave_ it worked for a little bit but it's very incovenient to put saran wrap on your hands every nite.  On my search to finding a cure_ I would google what I can find regarding other ways to prevent this embarassing disease and I found Robinul.  I've only been taking it for 3 weeks_ but it has definitely changed my life!  Despite the dry mouth and dry nasal passages_ I am willing to have that any day instead of having excessive sweating.  So if you are desperate like me...go ask your doctor for this drug even though he might explain that this is for ulcer patients.  My life is great and it's almost summertime and I'm sweat-free!!!,F,27,3  weeks2mg 2X D,5/5/2010,Robinul
88, 5, facial hyperhidrosis,dry mouth_ dry nasal passages,"I can't begin to explain how much this drug has changed my life. I read these posts when I first started it and I thought_ ""There's no way this will work that well for me."" Well_ it has. I struggled for over 20 years with excessive sweating. People who don't have this issue can't possibly understand how it affects your life. It was so bad that I would avoid almost any social activity. I wore sleeveless shirts in the middle of winter. The simplest task would make it worse_ and you can forget about shopping or trying on clothes! I would look like I had just gotten out of the shower...my hair would be drenched_ with sweat pouring down my face. The worst was when it would run down my neck and I'd look like I had just run a marathon. Because of this_ I only owned black or white shirts that wouldn't show the sweat stains down my back and chest. Once I worked myself up to three times a day_ my sweating almost vanished. I can now actually wear long sleeves and not worry about sweating. Friends commented on it almost immediately. ""You're wearing long sleeves!"" or ""You're not sweating!"" For the first time I can remember_ I actually get cold and will wear a coat outside in the winter. The dry mouth was tough to get used to_ but the nasal passage dryness has actually helped my allergies. My doctor says that I might eventually be able to wean myself down to two pills a day_ but I'll take three forever if the sweating stays gone. I actually feel like a normal",F,39,2  months1 mg 3X D,3/7/2010Email,Robinul
89, 5, hyperhidrosis,Dry mouth/ eyes.,I just got on Robinul and I am very impressed with the results.  I had ets 10 years ago to treat Palmar hyperhidrosis (helped somewhat but symptoms returned).  Still would sweat excessively in hot/humid environments.  Botox treatments were certainly effective but expensive_ administratively difficult_ and treat only the area applied.  With Robinul I took 2mg on an empty stomach in the morning for a few days with no effect_ then ramped up to 4mg.  For the past two days on 4mg I haven't had a drop of sweat all day.  Not even mild clamminess.  I'm in disbelief.  Side effects were dry mouth and slightly dry eyes.  But I just sip water all day and don't even notice it.  I'm going to scale down the dosage back to 2mg to see if that works now that I've been on it for a few days. If 2mg is still not effect I'll try 3mg and then back to 4mg.  But_ wow_ wish I tried this stuff earlier...If I just needed to treat hyperhidrosis in one area and money was not an issue_ I'd prefer botox to Robinul.  Otherwise_ I strongly suggest anyone suffering from Hyperhidrosis give Robinul a try.,M,27, 4MG 1X D,2/24/2010,Robinul
90, 3, Plantar HH,headache thus far,Well after reading this forum - i am highly impressed on how many people have had such a high success rate? My primary focus is for my feet for a mild/moderatae case of plantar HH. My question is can anyone tell me how many days it took for any results and the amount of milligrams they have been taking. I am  hoping that someone will respond as this has somehwat destroyed my confidence. By the way_ as it is the first day - my hand are already dry - but I have been taking a liquid called formalaz which does help - but wears off after four hours. This works well with my both the hands and feet - but I am more interested in the success rate for the feet. So far I have had a few reactions_ but not anything I will can not handle. Again if anyone can e-mail me regarding this that would be great. Thanks for taking the time to read my post.,M,30,1  days1 3X D,2/6/2010Email,Robinul
91, 5, Excessive sweating,Holy cotton mouth initially,The side effects are much worse when coming back to it after a break or just starting it alltogether on the max dosage_ which if you want the full effect_ do that. I was tired of having to deal with sweating during the day when there was definately no reason to_ that's really what hyperhydrosis is and it WAS annoying. But this stuff really regulates things. First day of school for the year_ it was atleast 70 degrees out_ having taken one before bed and one in the morning I did not sweat at all_ not even a little bit at all during the day. It was probably one of the best days of my life. It sounds sad but I live by this stuff_ every single night before bed and every single morning before I leave for school.,M,17,4  months,1/23/2010,Robinul
92, 5, overall hyperhidrosis,dry mouth_ eyes_ throat_ nasal passages_ flakey dry skin.overheating_ blurred vision_ puffy fingers,Just like everyone else_ this drug really changed my life. I grew up with my family members making fun of my sweaty hands and feet. I used to wear only black or white clothing and sweatshirts all the time to hide the sweat marks under my arms. For the past 7 years I have been free! I take 2 mg a day. One in the am and pm. I still sometimes have sweating problems on some days. My skin is dry and flakey but I don't mind. Lotion for extra dry skin like jergens works very well to mask that. I use eye drops for moderately dry eyes and that keeps me comfortable. Just drink a lot of water. This was honestly the best thing that the naval hospital has EVER recommended for me. I love it.,F,21,7  years,1/4/2010Email,Robinul
93, 5, Hyperhidrosis,Dry mouth_ blurred vision (occasionally)_ overheating during vigorous workouts,This medicine changed my life when I started taking it 11 years ago. It has always worked best for me when taken on an empty stomach. It has also been important to not eat for 2 hours after taking it. I wake up 2 hours early_ take my meds_ and then go back to sleep. Side effects decrease over time. I rarely experience dry mouth anymore.

96, 5, overall hyperhydrosis,Dry mouth_ dry nasal passages_ slight urinary hesitancy_ slightly blurred vision,This med has changed my life. I had severe sweating all over my body that started when I was in my 30s and seemed to be getting progressively worse. Lab work showed no reason for it. It affected my social life and what I wore and what I did. I was afraid to date! Summers were hell and I actually moved to a place with a year round cool climate to help. If your condition is this severe you will not mind the side effects. To me they are better then the sweating. I take 3-4 mg in a.m. on an empty stomach. If I go somewhere warm I take 6 mg in am and may take up to 10 mg during the course of the day as needed. I drink a lot of water to help overcome side effects and find that helps a lot but I still don't sweat much. Mints or gum help with the dry mouth and nasal drops for nose. On days when it is cool or during winter I don't take it unless I plan to do something where I would expect to sweat so you can use it on an as needed basis. My doctor had never heard of it so I took in info on it and documentation to show it could be used for this reason.,F,43,2  years,8/19/2009,Robinul

I have been getting this medication from my doctor for a long time but my doctor has become an out of network physician with my insurance recently. I am unable to find any other doctor to prescribe this for me. I asked my PCP but he didn't even know what kind of drug it is.

99, 4, Excessive Sweating,Occasional dry mouth/eyes_ very mild drowsiness,I've been taking Robinul for a little over a half a year and the results have been impressive. I started with Hyperhidrosis (Of the hands_ feet_ face_ and trunk) during adolescence and it only got worse as time went on. Not terribly noticeable during school but during sports and social events it became quite embarrassing. I started dosing on Robinul at 1mg twice a day_ morning and night. It was fairly effective from winter into spring but summer made that dosage fairly ineffective. I take about 3-4mgs a day now during the summer_ and while it's very helpful_ I still sweat copiously. I still recommend this drug for anyone with mild Hyperhidrosis. And to the user who can't find the right dosage_ you're just going to have to weigh the pros and cons and decide from there.

Read this website and researched Robinul went to Dr and asked for a prescription. Dr told me to start 1mg morning and night_ he told me to adjust until I found what worked for me. When I took 1mg morning and night I had no response. But when I took 2mg I did not sweat but when I got hot it's like I over heated. I guess cause I don't sweat anywhere else I couldn't cool down.  I cut one in half and took 1 plus half of another so 1.5mg and got no help. I am not really sure about this medicine yet.  Any thoughts?,F,43,12  days,7/16/2009Email,Robinul

Ask about it_ it'll be worth your time 10 fold!,M,25,5  days,5/10/2008Email,Robinul
123, 5, MENOPAUSAL HOT FLASHES AND NIGHT SW,NO SIDE EFFECTS,THANK GOODNESS FOR ROBINUL...I WAS ABLE TO SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN AGES.  I WAS EXPERIENCING AS MANY AS 20 OR MORE HOT FLASHES IS A 24 HR PERIOD.  THE FIRST DAY ON THIS MEDICATION I HAD 1.  TODAY IS THE SECOND DAY AND SO FAR I HAVEN'T HAD ANY.  I SURE HOPE IT CONTINUES TO WORK LIKE THIS_ BECAUSE I REFUSE TO TAKE HORMONES AND I HAVE TRIED ALL THE NATURAL REMEDIES WITH NO SUCCESS.,F,,2  days,4/24/2008,Robinul
124, 5, hyperhidrosis,The medication worked great for hyperhidrosis.  I have experienced some odd side effects that I was hoping some others have experienced.  For about two years I have had migraines on the right side of my head_ and annoying muscle problems on the right side of my neck and right upper back.  I also sometimes had racing heart and unexplained nervous shaking.  All of those problems have vanished since beginning Robinul.  It's like a godsend.  Something was obviously amiss with something involving acetylcholine.  Anyone else?,,M,,3  months,4/12/2008,Robinul
125, 5, Hyperhidrosis,None,I've suffered with hyperhidrosis all of my life (28 years). This medicine has absolutely changed my life. I can wear clothes without worrying about sweating through them and it helps my sweaty feet as well (along with drysol). I would highly recommmend it to those suffering with hyperhidrosis.,F,28, ,4/2/2008,Robinul
126, 4, IBS,side effects were very minimal_ but hard to focus pupils/dizziness_ trouble urinating_ and got heated really easy_ because it minimizes sweating.,perscribed 2mg a day_ but works fine at 1 mg a day. i normally take it 30 minutes before breakfast and dinner.,F,22,3  months,3/19/2008,Robinul
127, 1, Ulcers - 7 stomach ulcers,48 hours after starting Robinul_I began to experience EXTREME difficulty with URINATING. In fact_ at times it seemed almost impossible to go at all. I also began a little bit of itching. I stopped the Robinul then and there.    Woke up the next morning covered in a RASH that got worse as the day progressed. By the end of the day I was covered from head to toe. Started Benadryl and that didn't even help one bit.    Now_ six days later_ the rash has not gotten worse - but neither has it gotten better. I am able to urinate normally_ but the rash is painfully itchy and not responding to traditional treatment of Benadryl and cortisone creme_ so it's off for another costly doctor visit and I guess maybe a round of steroids - which I amleery about with all these ulcers.,This drug produced a very bad reaction with me and I take several drugs for anxiety and ulcers. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything. Beware of Robinul.,F,49,2  days,12/29/2007,Robinul
128, 4, Hyperhidrosis,In the first few months occasional headaches and dry mouth. Sometimes difficult to focus pupils.,"Robinul gave me the ability to control my palmer and planter HH. It has literally saved my life and given me the confidence I need to interact socially. The side effects even at their worse were nothing compared to the fact I could write_ touch and be ""normal"" around people.",M,17,3  months,12/18/2007,Robinul

132, 5, IBS,It made me a bit drowsy_ so I tried to wait and take it close to bedtime.  Slept GREAT and woke up with a little anti-depressant buzz.  If I take the full dose at any time_ I become agitated and jittery_ can't handle it.  So I cut them in half.,My doctor gave me this for IBS.  At the first sign I would take half a tablet and BAM!  it stops the problem very quickly.  When I can_ I try to delay taking till closer to bedtime_ but in a pinch will take at any time. THe IBS has gradually resolved over the years and now the same med. has been prescribed for me to dry up fluid in my ears.  I hope it works.  In any case_ the side effects are pleasant ones.,F,50,3  years,9/14/2007,Robinul
133, 5, Hyperhidrosis,Difficulty urinating_ dry mouth,This drug is awesome! Unfortunately_ I have developed a very shy bladder_ but hopefully that will go away.  I no longer have to ruin my clothes with an anti-perspirant_ so I've switched to amazing crystal deodorant.  I feel so much more comfortable in social situations!,F,26,1  months,9/3/2007,Robinul
134, 5, Hyperhidrosis,Really none that I have noticed.,I have suffered over 30 years with Hyperhidrosis.  I recently started a new job and just prior to that started taking Robinul in hopes I could enjoy my new job and finally feel normal for once.  I wanted to post my information in hopes someone suffering as I did would see this and look into taking Robinul for themselves.  It has totally changed my life and I'm so very thankful.  I went out and purchased nice new clothes for my new job.  I feel so good about myself!  I hope this helps others.  There is hope and you don't have to suffer from Hyperhidrosis thanks to Robinul.,F,51,4  months,5/30/2007,Robinul
135, 5, hyperhidrosis,Very few side effects. Mainly dry mouth and very mild headaches in the beginning.  All of which were very minimal.,Works miracles so far.  I have been taking it a short time and so far so good.  Does amazing job at drying up my overall body sweating.  I actually feel like a normal person for the first time in ten years!  I also find that it is not as effective when taken close to meals.  You should wait about hour to an hour and a half before or after a meal.,M,25,3  weeks,5/2/2007,Robinul
136, 4, hypohidrosis,i didnt really have very many side effects mostly dry mouth and eyes_ howevere during the summer months when it became hotter i would experience nose bleeds due to the medication drying me out. although i used nose drops to solve this.,since i have been taking robinul i now couldnt live without it. my life is so much easier now. i found it so hard before with socialising and exams etc. however i couldnt imagine copeing without it now!!!,F,16,18  months,1/2/2006,Robinul
137, 5, Hyperhidrosis,Headaches_ blurry vision_ constipation_ somewhat dry mouth - but most of these side effects have either already disappeared or are very minimal.,Highly recommend for symptoms of hyperhidrosis_ including the feet.  I take 1 mg at 10am_ and 1mg 10pm (be sure not to take it too closely to eating because in my experience it tends not to work as well).  I can't believe the things I am able to do_ again_ after nearly 25 years of either suffering through or avoiding!  I also need only deodorant_ now_ rather than an anti-perspirant/deodorant - and I have been taking this while living in the hot/humid summer in Texas!  I have heard that it might not work long-term for some_ and then there are others who have been taking it for years - I'll take any time off from HH symptoms that I can get.,F,40,30  days,7/7/2005,Robinul
138, 4, Hyperhidrosis of Hands and Feet,I experienced mild headaches for the first month.  Dry mouth at first but the longer I have taken Robinul_ the less dry mouth effects me.,I have taken Robinul for 7 years and it has changed my life socially giving me more confidence.  I take 2 mg in the winter months and 3 or 4 mg in summer months to dramatically reduce my sweating of hands and feet.,F,47,7  days,6/1/2005,Robinul
139, 4, Severe HyperHydrosis,blurry vision_ momentary disorientation_ dry mouth_ bloating_ and extreme heat feelings due to lack of sweat.,I can handle the side effects because the drug has given me back a huge part of my life. It worked mircles in drying up my overall body sweat including my underarms_ lower regions of my body_ and facial sweat. I usually take 2 tablet in the morning before I eat and it lasts all day.,M,31,10  months,5/8/2005,Robinul

141, 5, for hyperhidrosis,Dry mouth and blurry vision,It has done wonders in drying up my sweaty palms that I've suffered with for years.  I'll deal with the side effects.  This is a good drug if hyperhidrosis surgery or expensive Botox injections aren't an option.  I've been on 6mg everyday for 13 years.,F,42,13  years,6/2/2004Email,Robinul
