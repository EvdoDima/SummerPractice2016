0, 4, Tooth Surgery,Dizziness_ lightheaded_ fainting_ drowsy_ calm,It reduced my pain and made me feel very calm. My only big problem with it is that on the first day I fainted twice. Make sure you take it on a full stomach by the way so you aren't nauseous.,F,18,2  days,7/16/2016,Percocet
1, 1, Wisdom teeh,It was awful.First you are constantly sleepy so you can do much but sleep on it. Then the nausea comes and never leave. I took half a pill at 9pm because the pain was unbareable and then the other half at past midnight. A hojr later I was on the floor shaking and sweating while my heartbeat went nuts and I thought for sure I was overdosing. The pain is back and I cannot fall asleep thanks to it.,,F,23,2  days5-325,6/10/2016,Percocet
2, 4, Laparoscopy/ D&C post op,"Head rush ""high""_ extreme drowsiness_ dizziness_ shaking",I had my share of side effects from this however they weren't severe. The head rush would happen when it kicked in_ and it helped me not to care about the pain. The pain relief was nice but only stayed passed out pretty much the whole time I was on it_ I was constantly fighting sleep. I made sure family members monitored me on this. Overall it helped but not a fan of the drowsiness as it affected my daily activities.,F,22,1  weeks7.5 mg 4x,6/4/2016,Percocet

4, 3, foot surgery,This pain medicine gave me the most vivid lucid dreams. Also slight light headedness and a little tired but also warm. Even with half a dose. It helps with the pain but not as much as I expected such a strong medicine too. The side effects are more noticeable than the decrease in pain. Hopefully I won't need to take it for much longer.

I was having to take my migraine medication everyday and this is unusual for me. Recently I woke up with one of the worst migraines I have ever had. I did some reading about Percocet and discovered that it can cause worsening headaches in migraine sufferers so is not recommended. Apparently it can increase intracranial pressure.One of the listed side effects is headache. I actually did not find the hip pain relief effect to last more than 2 hours.,I would not recommend this drug due to the headache side effect and for the short acting analgesic effect.,F,58,7  days10mg,1/25/2015Email,Percocet

Had to take oral mineral oil_ several fleet enema's_ an entire box of Colace and Miralax to finally have BM. However_ I had had major abdominal surgery (open myomectomy) which included the removal of 27 fibroid tumors in an open myomectomy procedure with 10 inch surgical incision along with major swelling and pain. After three days in hospital on continuous PCA of dilaudid_ I went home and didn't move much for the first two weeks_ spending all day and night in bed with only exception being to use the bathroom in which I needed help getting out of bed and back to do so. Also_ I barely ate or drank fluids. So_ with this said_ the extreme constipation was due to all of those factors..

During the day I feel wonderful_ not only is the pain gone_ but I feel euphoric_ very relaxed and have a general 'high' feeling.  I can see why this drug gets abused....it really makes you feel great!  That is until I go to bed.  I'm usually exhausted by bedtime but this drug causes night sweats combined with chills.  I have terrible nighmares and wake up frequently.  If I take too many pills I actually feel 'hungover' the next day.  Its a good thing I was only given 50 tabs other wise I could see myself abusing this drug.  I truly have a better understanding of the trouble people have getting off this drug.

So I just had it reduced to 5 mg. Although they say it so addictive_ what I've found is if I use them only when in serious pain I don't have an issue. Never felt any 'fun' feeling from them.

65, 3, Fibromyalgia_ 2Back Surgery_ Lupus,I've been taking percocet on and off for 17 months now and I recommend that if you've had any substance abuse of any kind in the past_ this is NOT the medication for you! For first time users there are alot of downfalls to this medication if you do not take as prescribed. ATTENTION!!!! This drug can make you EXTREMELY SICK TO YOUR STOMACH WHETHER YOU TAKE IT WITH FOOD OR NOT! When the medication first kicks in_ you will experience a very high-euphoric feeling. An hour later you will be puking your guts out!!!!!,In addition they are highly addictive_ that is why I only take them when I absolutely needed to! My prescription calls for me to take it 4x a day_ but my doctor prescribes me 90 pills and they last me 4 months. Please be responsible!! This medication also causes you to itch terribly..like a crack head..lol..when the meds wear off you can be extremely irritable and easily angered_ and experience a severe migrane. This is your body(not mind) reminding you that you need to replenish the drug level in your blood stream. Thus meaning the onset of physical addiction.

He gave me a script for percocet. I knew Percocet would hit the nerves. I still don't think dentists would concentrate more on pain control. None of them I've dealt with seem to be wanting to totally relieve pain. For me_ Percocet did well. During the day_ I broke them in half.

With that said_ this dose that I take is only AS NEEDED and it certainly beats going to the hospital and having delayed treatment risking life threatening tachycardia because of episodes that become increasingly overwhelming to my body let alone my heart. Plus_ I found out the quicker I am able to ""trick"" my brain_ and thus_ counteract the pain mechanism of an episode (which never go away on their own; I've had them for over 3 mos. pre-treatment_ which is why I might have cluster headaches as well because the 30-min intervals; on top of ON I do get migraines that only respond a bit to Relpax_ Imitrex_ etc).  Anyway_ I think everyone should be careful when taking any pain medicine. I do strongly feel that some people have more addictive tendencies than others (I had to leave my husband for this reason) but these people should not be deprived of pain relief_ and no one should be persecuted for using something that provides such a benefit where the person can continue to lead a full life to the best of their ability. I do wish some doctors would take better profiles and be more proactive in managing their patients dosage like trying to circumvent any abuse by prescribing wkly dosages?

The next morning_ I decided to take only 1 pill at 6am and see what would happen.  I thought if I took 1 pill every 4 hours it would spread out and I wouldn't get so darn sleepy.  Again_ 1/2 hour later_ I felt like I couldn't keep my eyes open and the pain did NOT go away.  I called my doctor and explained all this and they were stumped?  WTF?

I can understand why it may become addictive because of the feeling of elation but I would say the negative side effects outweigh the positive side effects.

It works great for me. I never take the full prescribed amount unless I have a headache_ I just cut the 5s into halves or quarters. It's just enough to take the edge off_ but not enough to make me not functional. I find it much more effective than anything else I've tried. It's short acting_ so if I do err and take a little too much_ I know it will wear off soon.

By the time I got to high school_ i had to take at least 6 advil at a time to get anything out of them. tylenol never did anything for me. In High School_ I was getting these debilitating menstrual cramps and my dad gave me half of a percocet that he had from a shoulder surgery and I found the answers to all my problems.  when I've had to go in for various procedures_ they've given me other med (the worst case was vicoden that had me extrememly drugged out for a week) and I've always had to have them switch the prescription. Percocet is the only thing that ever works for me on any level. Obviously when i take too much for the level of pain_ it gets me high_ but the only real side effects are the ones i've listed and i've found that if i take a couple benedryl capsyls that i'm totally fine. The peeing thing kinda stumps me though_ so if anyone knows why that's happening_ i'd love to hear from them.,F,25,10  years,1/2/2010Email,Percocet
167, 4, neck pain/disc,constipation_ euphoria_ insomnia_ hyperactivity_dehydration and rebound migraines_ PAIN RELIEF,I was in the worst pain of my life and the Percocet gave me full relief from my pain. I just need to learn not to take it late at night because I will literally stay up until morning. I found that if I supplement with Motrin in between doses that it helps me with the headaches and pain when I come down. I also noticed that I get irritable when it wears off. Overall_ the benefits far outweigh the side effects for me. I could function instead of being stuck in my bed in pain.,F,28,14  days,12/31/2009,Percocet

I have found that I do better on small doses spread throughout the day and have no problems doing this...I know some people do though-so be careful and follow your doctor's instructions.

I experienced itching in eyebrows_ vaginal and buttocks_ then the itch moved to my ankles_ and finally to my incisions.  It was severe and miserable.  I had to take two benadryl capsules to counteracts the reaction.  While percocet relieved me of pain_ the itching was worse.

188, 1, pain from wisdom teeth extraction,chest pain_ anxiety_ throat swelling_ fatigue_ confusion_ nausea_ shortness of breath,This drug_ in my opinion_ is TERRIBLE. I woke up at 4am with severe pain and took 1/2 of the prescribed dosage. Within 30 minutes_ I could tell I made a huge mistake. I wanted the medication out of me. I considered forcing myself to vomit in effort to expell any remaining medication. It was as if I was having a bad trip. It gave me anxiety at first. Then after a couple hours I started having chest pain_ shortness of breath and swelling of the throat. That lasted pretty much all day. It is now 6pm and I'm still feeling nauseous and the shortness of breath. In addition_ I now feel very fatigued and confused. I can't believe I am having this reaction after taking 1/2 of a pill. I have taken vicodin and tylenol and never experienced any of these symptoms. I probably should have gone to the emergency room.,F,27,1  days,7/1/2009,Percocet
189, 4, herniated disc/chronic pain,Vivid dreams.  Mild constipation. Extreme bouts of hot flashes/sweating.,Don't know if the hot flashes are from the medication or some other cause.  Works well for the pain.  Dr. has opium phobia and will not give script fo oxycontin.  Take oxycodone 15 mg.  Cut in half and take six times a day.  If I take the whole pill as prescribed_ it fades after about 4 hours and then I am screwed waiting around for the next dose time.

Post-Op I now find that Percocet is the only serious pain reliever that I can tolerate. It works pretty well. I would not be able to get through Physical Re-Hab without it. I am being very careful regarding dependancy issues. The only real problem I have with it is the ITCHING but I can eat that anytime over the pain.

Inoperable.I have a problem (not addiction) to opiates. When in the hospital I was given morphine which produced such severe flu-like symptons that I thought I was dying. Dilaudid also makes me ill well past the cost/benefit line. Ditto for Phentanyl.Vicodin does nothing for my pain.Percocet/APAP 10/325 does help_ quite a bit_ with my pain. The itching can become intolerable at times (it is NOT an allergy but a product of the opioid actions)but the necessity to obtain relief from the pain outweighs the itching problem almost all of the time. It does sometimes make me nauseous but nothing like the Dilaudid or Phentanyl.Some people claim that Benadryl helps with the itching but I do not find that and I try to avoid mixing any medications if I possibly can,M,52,7  years,6/6/2009,Percocet

I have an L5-S1 disc herniation and 70% compression of my neuroforamen. I am seeing the neurosurgeon next week. I also have DDD  But it enrages me because of all  the red tape i had to go through to get a doctor to prescribe this medicine for me because of all the DRUGGIES and people with MINOR pain/back issues who don't even need it.

They were not bad enough to keep me from taking it when I needed it. It can be VERY addicting so I only take it when I truely need it. Tolerance builds quickly so I always wait as long as I can to take it. And the loopy feeling helps me forget my emotional pain of having 2 stepsons being forced to live in an abusive home and my husband being in Iraq right now. Sounds silly but it helps my anxiety about both situations.,F,29,2  months,4/24/2009Email,Percocet

When I had spinal fusion it worked for that severe pain. As the days went by I found I needed 1 every 2 hours to keep ahead of the pain which probably caused the addictions. It took 3 pretty bad days to get weaned from the drug_ my friends couldn't help but see me crawling out of my skin_ unable to stop moving. This would not be my choice for a recreational drug.,M,61,30  days,4/19/2009,Percocet

When my gall bladder gets inflamed my whole midsection feels like I've been torn in half.  I used to take Tylenol 3_ but Percocet seems to work much better.  I loved_ and still love Percocet.  I felt talkative_ happy_ and an overall euphoria.  There was no pain what so ever.  I did develop some insomnia_ and sleep felt incomplete with periodic waking.  I did have a small amount of nausea but this was relieved with a cold glass of water and laying down for a short while.  I also developed an addiction to the med and would take it when the pain was easily tolerable with a OTC Tylenol or Advil.  I still think its a good product_ but would caution against long term use.

I am only taking one tab every four hours as needed. The first two days that I was taking it I had no side effects other than being tired_ but after the third day I developed extreme itching and started having vivid nightmares.,F,27,7  days,3/10/2009,Percocet

206, 5, Back Surgery / Arthritis / Migraine,Slight constipation at times and itching of the skin. The itching is the worst part of this drug. Over the years it seems to have gotten worse but it only happens on occassion.,I initially took this when I started having back problems which eventually took surgery to help. Surgery was the best thing that happened to help my back however in order to lead a normal life and do things I could and would like to do such as golf_ and work around the house_ functional somewhat normally I need to take percocet. I can barely move my fingers in the morning due to arthritis and then my back eventually starts up. I have taken percocet off and on (mostly on) for six plus years now. I do agree the dose becomes less effective after awhile. You have to be cautious to not take it unless you need it and in that way you keep the dose effective. I haven't uplifted my dosage for a couple of years. I have tried to decrease the milligrams but that didn't work for the pain. For the person that said to cut your pills in half to decrease your dosage... please do not listen to that. If you cut your pills you are basically boosting your short term dose to get a buzz and quick pain relief,M,46,7  years,2/19/2009,Percocet

208, 5, Chronic Pain L4-5 surgery_ DDD_ OA,Some constipation. Occasional drowsiness. VERY talkative.,I've taken this drug off and on for over 19 years. I do hit tolerance with it and must switch off it for awhile. It works very well though for breakthrough pain as long as I manage the drug properly. Luckily I've never had a MD not want to prescribe_ which I believe is due to my records being very complete and me being open_ honest and trustworthy.,F,51,19  years,2/8/2009Email,Percocet
209, 4, Psoriatic Arthritis,Constipation_ minor mood swings_ minor hyperactivity.,I've been taking Percocet for a very painful type of arthritis (Psoriatic) for several years now.  It has proven effective at relieving the pain_ but since the effects tend to diminish over time with long-term use_ I had to discontinue use when pain was low in order to counter that effect.  Addictability is a concern here but with the right pain management attitude and doctor monitoring of monthly dosages_ I was easily able to keep that from being an issue.  Strongly recommend close monitoring by a physician for any patient with drug addictability factors.  Managed correctly_ this medication is a GREAT addition to a pain management program for moderate to severe pain!  Alternate with Lortab (or an acceptable alternative) occasionally to keep effectiveness up when pain is a constant.,M,48,3  years,2/1/2009,Percocet

After only a few minutes after taking a pill_ I immediately noticed a drop in pain levels in my lower back_ almost to the point where it eliminated it completely. But it did make me light-headed and drowsy. I had to make sure that I had nothing else to do for the rest of the evening since I would usually fall asleep after taking a pill. I noticed that it did make me itch a lot_ at times severe enough to interrupt sleep. (I'm a heavy sleeper_ and for me to wake up because of itching says a lot about that particular side-effect.),M,31,5  days,1/14/2009,Percocet

Only side effect was minor constipation.,Opiates aren't for everyone_ my advice to anyone new to these types of drugs (vicodin_ percocet_ etc) is to take half the recommended dosage as everyone reacts differently. I've been lucky and have yet to have any adverse reactions to any of these medications (have used them for a variety of sports related injuries and surgeries)_ but be safe and do NOT take more than the recommended dosage.,M,27,14  days,1/2/2009,Percocet

However_ i would vomit after the 2nd dose of the day.  made me loopy and lightheaded_ my hands tingled and the rest of me was completely numb.  It did the job_ but not my favorite.

I'm done with it.,I knew that narcotics could make me queasy_ but nothing like this. I would say that drinking beer for the pain was about as effective and did not carry the side effect of nausea and vomiting.

Losing concentration. Feeling break through pain now after third day_ restless.I do not want to continue but it is very expensive. I am in the cold weather and had  chronic pain down neck and shoulder! I should have known better than to try and take this drug! I would rather start with combination of a lower strength drug than not to be able to control it! the jury is still out! You have to research before taking any drug and effects people different due to emotional conditions I believe. I read that it has addictive behaviors_ not good but any drug has cause for psychological addiction. only get a few days worth and try different meds before getting quantity.

225, 4, tibial plateau fracture pre/post-op,CONSTIPATION!!! Some mild sedation at times_ but that isn't necessarily a bad thing,Percocet works very well for my pain taken every 4 hours. At first it was prescribed by the ER MD for every 6 hrs and it was wearing off before then. My ortho surgeon prescribed it for 1-2 tabs every 4-6 hrs after seeing me though. I only needed 1 tab every 6 hrs before my surgery_ but after the ORIF I definately needed 2 tabs every 4 hrs_ and still do 1 week post-op. For some reason it works better than plain oxycodone at the same dosage_ even when I took tylenol with it. Can't explain that_ but all that matters is that it works. The only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the bad constipation_ but I just started taking some Miralax_ so here's hoping. (I'm only 24 and have never been constipated before_ and it is so AWFUL_ I never would have imagined it was so bad),F,24,14  days,11/30/2008,Percocet

The second surgery was today. I was given a local block anesthetic and a sedative for surgery. When I woke up I felt completely fine except for pain in my foot. I was given 1 percocet for the pain and felt horribly nauseas for the next 5 hours. I hate this medicine.,F,26, ,11/14/2008,Percocet
230, 5, two torn shoulder muscles,slight dizziness_flush feeling of the face_ and some difficulty urinating,Percocet has saved my life for my shoulder pain. Ive tried everything motrin_ ultram_ vicodin_ ms contin_ and darvocet. This one worked the best other than oxycontin but I was only on that for a month because Its so expensive. That theres not a whole big differene between the two. I would recommend this drug to anyone in moderate to severe pain. Just take it easy with it.

I had significant bruising from the sprain going from below my ankle to about a 1/3 the way up my leg/calf.  I had additional bruising from the actual fall elsewhere too.  The side effects of the percocet did not offset the benefits of this pain killer.  It caused me to cry for no reason (think television pregnancy mood swings) and made me extremely talkative.  Drowsiness wasn't an issue since I wanted it for sleep but it only seemed to affect me if I purposely tried to sleep.,F,29,5  days,11/8/2008,Percocet

There are more problems (kidney_liver_ etc.) with the compounded versions than with straight oxycodone tabs.My dosage was titrated up to 30mg every 4 hrs_ supplimenting Methadone tabs.

I take half a tab of 5mg/325mg and it seems to work once or twice a day.  If it is raining maybe a whole tab.  It doesn't get rid of the pain completely at all_ but it does make it so I can get out and be a functional member of society.

Over all loopy feeling.  Anxiety (only after the a couple of days taking it).,I was prescribed Percocet as well as Motrin 600 after the extraction of my wisdom teeth.  I was only taking the Motrin at first.  Then I developed dry sockets five days after my extraction and the pain was unbearable.  At that point_ the Motrin did not seem to be doing anything_ so I tried the Percocet.  Wow.  I didn't know which was worse_ the pain from my teeth or the crazy side effects that the Percocet gave me.  It was awful.  They were prescribed to be taken once every 4-6 hours_ so I figured that I would continue at least for a couple of days_ to see if I could acclimate myself to it.  It didn't happen.  I continued to feel loopy and nauseous.  When I say nauseous_ I mean to the point where I had to just go to sleep in order for the medication to wear off.  Then it seemed as if every noise was magnified 100 decibels.  For example the ringing of a telephone_ or a car honking its horn_ even the TV volume had to be turned down extremely low.

I split them yet again and took a quarter of a dose.  They still made me feel cloudy and my head spun_ although they didn't make me sleepy at that dose.  I stopped them again.

275, 4, pain & fibromyalgia complications,I was warned beforehand that drowsiness was a predominant side effect_ and that it was_ though not to the point where I was dropping off in my desk chair at home or at work. Experienced some dry mouth which was easily remedied with UNsweetened iced tea and ice water. Slight numbness of lips and fingertips (kept an eye on that_ being diabetic). Some feeling of detachment_ not inconsistent with a good alcohol buzz. Pain relief seemed to go hand-in-hand with numbness in otherwise unaffected extremities.,In my experience_ using this drug for a two-week period_ the worst side effects were the drowsiness 1-2 hours after taking the 5mg/ orally_ and then the drymouth. Thankfully the latter is easily remedied with noncarbonated and unsweetened beverages. The percocet did more than vicodin for my deep muscle pain (can walk without my legs feeling like overcooked fettuccini); thankfully I only needed it for a short period of time and got the relief I needed. I can't speculate on long-term usage_ but I know I personally wouldn't want a month's RX for this drug simply because I fear becoming dependent. If Aleve or something can get me through the day_ I'll bear with background pain_ but if it's overwhelming and affecting how I function... I would not mind having maybe half a dozen percocet stashed in my medicine cabinet to keep the demons away long enough for me to be fully functional.,M,22,14  days,2/28/2008,Percocet

Withdrawl (Insomnia_ woke up every 40 minutes at night once I did fall asleep with terrible nightmares and shakes/tremors/""creepie crawlies""...see why in addt'l comments)",I got my back problems from a hockey injury. Due to my age_ my doctor hesitated to prescribe any narcotics to me (just muscle relaxers) for my sciatica. It started to get extremely bad (crippling bad) and my parents almost took me to the ED because I couldn't even stand up. At that time_ I was talking of suicide. Well_ I was closely watched and the next day the doctor had me in his OFFICE. Not even an exam room...his actual office at the hospital. He gave me a script for Percocet 5mg/325mg (and refered me to my primary care doc for 5mg Zoloft until my condition approved with surgery). [Oh yeah_ and when I walked into the pharmacy with a letterman's jacket and a script for percocet_ it was impossible to get it filled. They don't stereotype or anything...] I took took one or two per day for a month up until it progressed to me being stuck on the floor.

After laying down for several hours_ watched by my nurse and husband the effects lessened.  I lowered my dose to 1 pill every 6 hours_ but again woke up the next night with same side effects.  It is like the medication would build up over a period of time and then leave me 'stoned' (as my doctor put it).

They always worked for my kidney stone pain in as little as 15 minutes. That high would last for about 3 hours at its strongest point.  I get kidney stones often_ atleast one stone every other year and I must say...I look forward to the medicine cuz I know I'm getting percocet.  However_ the big downfall I hate is when my pills are gone and I still feel like I need them to get through the day_ but they're all gone.  I then feel depressed_ moody_ and restless.

Then I would look forward to taking another pill.Pounding (slightly) heartbeat wasn't a factor unless trying to sleep and not much one then as the the Perc made one drowsy.The severe constipation I experienced was a major factor for me_ and is the reason I will never take it again.  (Severe means mega painful elimination_ say half as painful as breaking a leg painful)I would highly recommend that you drink plenty of liquids and maybe add some fiber to your diet when taking this drug.

Anyone taking this drug (and many others in the Opiate classes) over time WILL develop tolerance and dependence.  It is NORMAL.  The reason that this drug gets such a bad rap from the DEA and other US Governmental agencies is because they CONFUSE those terms.  If they were to actually analyze data on patients who are taking the drug BECAUSE of pain_ they would realize that those who take it for that reason ARE THE LEAST LIKELY TO ABUSE IT_ AND FOLLOW THE DOSAGES AS PRESCRIBED.

I find it makes me both groggy and anxious.,Percocet was great for miscarriage pain. That and the heating pad allowed me to miscarry at home (which I prefered after a previous D&C). However for really bad laparoscopic shoulder pain it was not enough pain relief to sleep_ and after four days of the maximum dose (600 mg Ibuprofen/6 hours + 2 5/325 tables every four hours) and three days of about half that_ I am irritable_ anxious_ having stress dreams_ upset stomach. Since I was on high doses for the first few days I have the odd effect of feeling worse (less happy and more injured where the surgery was) now then I did just after surgery_ which is discouraging.,F,36,7  days,5/23/2007,Percocet

I felt dizziness but not in a bad way_ some small headaches_ some shortness of breath for only a limited time after it kicked in. Able to act normal around people_ but feeling amazing_ but short tempered and impatient.,I can see how people can get addicted to this drug_ and I have studied the addictiveness of drugs.even though im putting my self at risk. but Its a great feeling to experience. This was the only time I have ever tried this drug_ and I plan to keep it that way for unless in pain. I strongly suggest not taking this drug only to get high. It stimulates a different part of the brain which can make you dependent on any drug you take. Unless your in pain you will not become dependent on this drug only when you decide to take it to prevent pain when your not in pain yet or not likely to have pain you are at risk for dependence.,M,18,1  days,4/24/2007,Percocet

DO NOT COMBINE WITH ALCOHOL OR OTHER SEDATIVES/TRANQUILIZERS.,took for moderate hyperextended knee pain and other stuff.....  took 3 generic 7.5mg/325 tablets.  Great buzz and relief of pain but short acting(2-3 hrs).  I don't advise snorting this drug and do not take with alcohol.  This version of the drug contains tylenol_ which when combined with alcohol increases risk of liver problems.  If you plan on using this drug recreationally or legitmately_ be very careful because tolerance/addiction potential develops rapidly.  Do not use daily for more than 7 days as withdrawal may develop.  Do not abruptly stop using this drug after long term use.  I am not a healthcare professional and have no medical training.  I am not a junkie either.  This info is just from personal experiences as well as other person's experiences.  If you develop really bad itching_ take an anti-histamine like claritin_ benadryl_ etc.  *THIS INFO IS NOT TO REPLACE THAT OF A DOCTOR/OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONAL.*,M,20,5  times,4/23/2007,Percocet

All that can be done is to sleep.  After skipping the drug for two days_ I took half a pill_ resulting in a splitting 12-hr headache.  The remainder of the prescription is in my trash!

347, 3, Wisdom Teeth post extraction,Dizzyness_ Shortness of breath_ racing heart rate_ sweaty palms and feet_ dry mouth,I was perscribed Oxycodon (generic percocet) 5/325 tablet to be taken every 4 hours by my oral surgeon.  Explaining to him that I had trouble taking pills it was expressed to simply crush it (I know about time release and brought it up but that didn't seem to be a problem when I did).  Having never taken an opiate derivative before and nowhere on the directions did it say crushing was bad_ I crushed the tablet and took it with fruit smoothie.  Fell asleep and awoke about 5 hours later.  I took another one as prescribed after I crushed it and took it with a glass of water. Not more than an hour later I started to get sweaty hands and feet_ shortness of breath_ racing heartrate_ dry mouth.  This drug ultimately makes you sleep and reduces pain with the acetaminophen.  All I can say is crushing it may have lead to the effects  I experienced_ too bad I wasn't told this nor did I read it till after the fact.

If I took two within 5 hours of each other_ my breathing slows to a scary level_ and I am uncontrollably drowsy. Mild hallucinogenic effect if I took too many in a short amount of time.,After being on Oxycontin_ Vicodin and Morphine_ I have found that Percocet has allowed me the most functionality with pain relief. With Oxycontin_ I would sleep for 8-10 hours at a time_ and on Morphine I felt like I could run a marathon (not good on a broken ankle). Vicodin allowed NO pain relief_ so Percocet is a wonder drug!

I was tired of feeling so nauseous so I switched to Tylenol 3's which did absolutly nothing for the pain.  The first day I switched back to Percocet I vomited all day.

I've also experienced a hard_ racing heartbeat that is worse at night time??  Very strange.  Overall an excellent painkiller,this is one of the only meds that helps my terrible headaches.  I only wish it was longer lasting because it seems to be very short acting.  sometimes i can't sleep if I take it too close to bed time.  i actually am energetic instead of tired like many of the other reviewers.  guess it's different for everyone.,F,31, ,3/8/2007,Percocet

So_ with long-term chronic pain this should not be the drug of choice since it didn't help me and I have always felt that you shouldn't put a drug in your systom if it will not do anything for you. Percocet should not be perscribed to those with chronic pain but it may work for those with acute pain.,Doctors should know bettter than to perscribe Percocet to those with chronic pain_ This drug does not help to reduce pain as well as other pain killers I have tried.

I have never had a problem stopping my medication when I dont need them anymore_ but i did notice a slight tolerance when i needed them 2 years down the road meaning i needed a higher dose to dull the pain. I will say that percocet does not get rid of the pain_ only masks it_ so you have to understand that.

I did not like how I felt so I stopped cold turkey and will never take another opiate again.,I did not have a legit Rx I took someone else's unused pills for kicks.  If you crush Percocet and snort it you will get a very_ very nice opiate high in less than a minute.  The bad side is when it wears off.  You reach for more.  I snorted a lot one night and when I ran out I became so irritable I was shocked.  It certainly will knock out low-level persistent pain but be careful.

418, 4, Total Knee Replacement,Dreaming_ itching_ dry mouth at night_,Percocet helped very well as an oral pain med.  It took away the knee pain from surgery.  It takes about 30 to 40 minutes for it to kick in but does work once it does kick in and last for 3 to 4 hours. I was taking two 5 mg tablets at first but now post op 3 weeks I am only taking one 5 mg tablet.

A little off balance but full of energy and very happy_ optimistic. I became very talkative and had that good all over feeling. It gives a pretty clean high too_ meaning you can function almost ordinarily.

422, 5, dysmenorrhea,Slight dizziness_ anxiety_ sleep disturbance.  Tends to cause nightmares_ or confusing dreams where you don't know if you're asleep or awake_ or where you are.  Because of this_ it's better for daytime use_ when the side effects are hardly noticeable.  Very good for pain management when the OTC stuff just does not work at all.   The low level dose (I believe 5 mg is the lowest oxy made) is excellent for handling those more intense pains like sharp backache and migraine_ while the medium and high doses should be left to cancer pain and severe injury.   Since I take this for about 4 days a month_ I have not had any withdrawal or addiction problems.  It also does not provide any kind of high or even a buzz at 10 mg_ though it will sometimes elevate my mood to a comfortable_ pleasant feeling.,I take 5 to 10 mg doses of this_ and it effectively eliminates the pain.   My pain with this disorder fluctuates from level 4-5_ and sometimes the 5 mg dose is not quite enough.   I can't take it at night_ though_ since it causes pounding heartbeat and really wild anxiety.  Like Vicodin_ it will make my hearing really sensitive_ and any sound (especially if I doze off) will sound thunderous and cause a profound_ anxious reaction.,F,28,4  days,2/2/2006Email,Percocet

It did however actually let me sleep sometimes which was a godsend b/c I was in such horrible pain.  Mentally I was shot when I was on it_ couldn't remember things or think of specific words while trying to describe things. Found some blood in my nose but never actually got bloody nose. I itched some but not too bad_ but it definitely relaxed me and made things more bearable.,I had a severely ruptured disk (1cm) at L5S1 which had broken off and was laying on my sciatic nerve. I had constant excruciating pain in the back of my right thigh and lost almost all feeling in my foot. I took percocet for more than a month before they got me in for back surgery and it was alright. However after back surgery when the ruptured piece was removed it was awesome. One 5-325mg Percocet every 4 hours made the incision in my back tolerable_ but I had to take 2 every 4 hours to combat the new sciatic nerve pain. Because they had removed what was pressing on my sciatic nerve_ now I was getting severe shooting pains up and down my left as feeling returned to it. Sometimes that last hour seemed like hell just waiting on the next dose but once I took it_ the pain was lessened and I was actually able to lay down and relax for the first time in over a month. It didn't completely make the sciatic pain go away but definitely made it tolerable and by then the inciscion site hardly hur,F,30,2  months,1/20/2006Email,Percocet

I am taking a dose of 10/325 (much better than10/650_ because you can augment it with tylenol as needed_ ortake one tylenol a few hours before bed without interferingwith the ability to take the percocet at bedtime).Much better than vicodin(hydrocodone) which did nothing for mypain.,M,50,3  weeks,12/28/2005,Percocet

As the doctors say_ take it before the onset of pain rather than when something flares up. I have made the mistake all too frequently of popping a whole one when all I may have needed is half. The result is dizziness and nausea. The other comparitive meds_ at least for me_ Vicodin_ Percodan_ etc. just do not work.,M,40,10  years,12/2/2005,Percocet

I start low and move up to see how much I need.  I take 5/325s.  I'll cut them in quarters if I need to_ but through trial and error_ I've determined how much I need for the level of pain I'm in.

In about 30 mins I can feel the pain just GO AWAY!  But then again_ so does all other feeling!  I've only taken it before bed and during the night_ as I am still waking up every 4-5 hours with pain_ especially since the cast came off and the pain is worse at night.  Last night I took 2 because I overdid it during the day and I wanted to sleep_ and I am sorry for having done that.  I am going to try other remedies to deal with the night pain because of the way I feel this morning (which is how I found this website): sick to my stomach_ dizzy and on the verge of vomiting.  I'd rather have the pain in my ankle than the pain in my head.  If you need SERIOUS pain relief_ percocet really works.  But beware of the side effects and take only as little as you need.

Also_ due to the pain involved_ I became a lunatic wanting to get my hands on those pills (they gave me ONE at 1AM the ER and I was waiting for the pharmacy to fill the perscription for the rest at 10AM_ just waiting for the next wave of pain from the kidneystone). Then I drifted in and out of being coherent for a day. Would spend 45 minutes reading a page in a book. I DO think it somehow shielded me from the worst of the pain.,I understand kidneystones are very painful_ but it seems like this medication reduced it from a 10 all the way down to a .... 10. Didn't seem to do much for the pain_ I was otherworldly possessed_ shaking uncontrollably_ etc. BUT_ I didn't seem to care about the pain_ or that I couldn't control my breathing or shaking.  IF it actually did help_ and I kind of think it did_ I cannot imagine the pain of a kidneystone.,M,46,0.5  days,5/7/2005Email,Percocet
451, 5, Broken Femur - Post Surgery,Light sweats_ constipation (use laxative to avoid problems),This stuff is great.  Provided real pain relief.  Allowed me to sleep_ and to do my physio.

452, 4, fibromyalgia and chron myof pain,dependence_ addiction_ euphoria_ weak bladder muscles_ nausea_ itching,Helped with initial pain range of 7_8_9_10 on scale of 1 - 10_ but should be discontinued asap due to addiction and physical dependence. If I am late for a dose_ i hurt all over. It has been difficult to wean off this medicine even though I want to. I do not know what I would have done without this medicine_ I was in so much pain. But now I am not in as much pain but am addicted to it.,F,44,1  years,4/28/2005,Percocet
453, 5, Chronic Back Pain,Taking 10/325 4/day. I feel extremely happy - almost too happy. It's the first time I've had adequate pain relief since 1996.

454, 3, Severe pain following a D&C surgery,Woke up with a TERRIBLE migraine after 2nd night of being on drug (only 5MG a day). Mood swings_ bad dreams_ nausea_ out of body experience_ spinning room_ drowsy ALL day long. I've been laying in bed all day since i was on Morphine in the ER for severe pain_ i have no energy since using drug since Sunday. Drug effect feels wonderful when consumed in early evening_ however when consume in early morning i feel like i'm having a bad hangover. While laying down i will dose off then wake up abruptly as if i'm having sleep apnea. When drug wears off pain is much worse and i'm suffering from pain i didn't suffer from prior to using this drug such as leg pain. Pain keeps coming back at the same time like clock work. MUST drink plenty of water as constipation will occur. I'm not very happy with this drug_ i can only imagine if i had been consuming a larger dose_ yikes.,,F,26,3  days,4/19/2005,Percocet

But I took this once before for the same problem for a month and did go through a bit of a withdrawl when I did not need it any longer.

458, 4, Wisdom tooth gum infection,Ithing (holy cow!);  Urination muscles become a little week; Nausea (only if taken on empty stomach).,Great drug if you like feeling like you stoned out of your mind.  Kills the pain_ but it wears off quicker than the labels claim_ so you will wind up taking it more often than it recommends.  I am on 10mg (only supposed to take 1 per 6 hours_ but I was taking 1 every 3 hours).  Make you feel like your great and wonderful_ with NO medication hangover type feelings.  Would recommend to anyone who has pain that over the counter drugs can't help with.  Don't take it if you don't plan on being a trooper and forcing yourself off it at the end.  The Withdrawal is a little rough_ but one or two nights of tossing and turning should do it--would recommend a sleeping pill for those couple of night while you go through it.,M,32,1  weeks,4/12/2005,Percocet

Calmness.,I took it on and off_ since I broke two diffent ribs a year apart_ and before that I took it because a third of my kidney died off (Renal Infarct). It worked very well_ but I seemed to need more than the average person. I took about twice the amount required and it took care of the pain. This isn't abnormal with me since it seems like that happens with any pain killer I used in the past. It also lowered my blood pressure_ and took care of another disorder that I had all my life (Panic Dissorder).,M,43,10  months,2/11/2005,Percocet

The ER had to give me 4 injections IV of morphine to touch the pain.  I was initially given generic vicodin and that didn't help that much.  I had to go back for an urgent care visit and hyperventilated from pain while there.  I don't recomment that experience to your worse enemy!  Had I know ahead of time what hyperventilation does_ I would have been much better off.The generic percocet is the first rx they gave me that is really helping and I can deal with the side effects since it's significanltly reducing the pain. Although the constipation episode was unpleasant_ I'll spare everyone the details.  Be thankful_ very thankful!This is my first time taking percocet.

481, 3, P.O. pain and back pain.,None_ slight euphoria.,Its work better then Vicoden for pain_ but still percocet isn't all that strong of a pain killer. I'd take four percocets in one dose and my hand would still be in pain and even though its not a recomended thing to do I'd take six to eight percocets to kill pain sometimes. Dilaudid works alot better on pain after surgery or back pain. Ive been given about a dozzen scripts of percocet in my life and in my opinion Percocet would be a great medication to be used for anxiety relief. Well the oxycodone alone would be better for that the tylenol wouldn't be needed besides too much tylenols bad on your liver anyway.,M,23,2  months,11/11/2004Email,Percocet

However to deal with flares (intense inflammation in major joints) I have to increase the dosage and apply other treatments such as moist heat_ massage_ and rest.

I'd rather take the than Tylenol #3 or #4 because they don't bind you up as does the tylenol.
