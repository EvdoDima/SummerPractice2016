0, 1, Regulate periods,Benign tumors everywhere,I am now 45_ but began taking Ortho Tri Cyclen at 15 to regulate long_ heavy periods. It did work for that reason. I can recall knowing the exact day I would start and end. I also recall that I had very clear skin for a teenager. I believe I was on this for maybe 7 years and had no issues (that I noticed). I have 2 healthy boys_ 19 and 20_ and I was always athletic and energetic and organized_ blah blah. BUT_ during a random check up in 2010 something was off in my blood test that lead to a CT scan_ then and MRI_ that eventually led to a liver biopsy. I have a monster benign tumor in my liver (and several other smaller ones) known as FNH Focal Nodule Hyperplasia. That's where it all started. Since then_ it was discovered I had monster gallstones that led to my gallbladder being removed_ huge fibroids that led to my uterus being removed_ and huge nodules on both sides of my thyroid that led a total thyroidectomy. Also recently found small benign cysts on my right breast_ but I understand this is common for women at 40. So now I'm a hot mess with no thyroid and my digestive system and hormones are a disgrace. Synthetic hormones can't help me b/c I have no gallbladder and my liver is consumed with these tumors so I cannot process the T4 to T3 for metabolism and whatever else it does. Something to do with bile. My body will not digest food properly so it just kinda sits there and all I want to do is sleep. I have gained almost 20 lbs since this past August. I sleep 10-11 hours a,F,45,7  yearsUnsure,3/10/2016,Ortho tri-cyclen
1, 1, To regulate hormones,Nausea BloatingMigranes Severe dry skinRash !!,I started taking Trinessa( generic of Ortho) to regulate my hormones after having my 7th child 2 years ago. So the 1st month I had some nausea and migranes which is normal for starting out to regulate my system. Towards the end of the 1st month I started to notice my face was dry and wrinkles by my mouth going up sideways. It didn't click that it was the BC until the 2nd week into month 2. My body hasn't been able to retain moisture at all and that's why my face has wrinkles going sideways up my face. This pill helps with severe acne but it overly drys your face and body out! My boobs occasionally felt heavier and appeared that way_ but didn't stay that way. Period became regular_ acne went away face and back. But it sucks all the moisture out of your skin& I drink a gallon of water a day everyday! I didn't gain weight or lose with this pill. However_ at the end of my month 2 going into month 3_ I developed a rash bumpy and very itchy rash on my right forearm. Each day for 2 weeks the rash became worse from wrist to my bicpes and now it's on my face ( by my eyes_ on my eye lids_ forehead_ cheeks_ neck_ inside my ears_ behind my ears) I have been to the ER twice for this_ I was prescribed a very high antihistamine to help with the rash along with a steroid cream. So far it hasn't helped! Oh my face swelled up around my eyes and on my cheeks and still is like that today ( 02/05/216) oh and it gave me dry scalp too. It took me almost three months to develop an allergic react,F,31,2  months28 mg,2/5/2016Email,Ortho tri-cyclen
2, 5, Birth Control,Some weight gainSlightly worsened acne2-3 days each cycle of depression Overall introverted feelingsLowered sex drive,The pill obviously worked as intended_ because after 1.5 years of taking it every night_ I'm not pregnant. The side effects took about 3 months to calm down and become predictable (I knew when my bad days would be as far as minor depression or mild cramps just before period). I'm a naturally introverted person_ but I think this pill made it even more pronounced. I didn't mind being on it_ and I'm only changing pills because of insurance purposes. Everyone's body chemistry is different_ so I can only say this pill worked for me; I recommend giving it a couple months to adjust your body's cycle before dismissing it.,F,25,1  years,10/15/2015,Ortho tri-cyclen

Since starting the pill_ I've experienced insomnia (I almost fell asleep driving home yesterday). I've also experienced sexual dysfunction for the first time in my life.

Would suddenly snap on my boyfriend for no reason. I get upset over things I would never normally get upset about. I have absolutely no desire to drink or go out and have fun. My period is always irregular and I have bad cramps. During the first month it made my acne absolutely terrible. I get a zit every now and then but my cheeks_ neck_ forehead_ everywhere was covered in crator sized zits. I am lacking enjoyment in all the things I used to be passionate about.

This was probably the worst decision ive made this year.. The first week was a living hell considering i was nauseous every morning for about a week and throughout my whole use of this pill i was extremely irritated with all my friends for no particular reason and i would cry about every other day. It also did not help that i gained a noticeable 5-10 pounds because on top of that i was so emotionally so i felt very body conscious.  I have a very high metabolism so gaining weight is VERY hard for me but this pill managed to do that. PLEASE for your own sake do not take  this pill!!!!,F,15,27  days 1X D,1/31/2015,Ortho tri-cyclen

It prevented pregancy_ as it is intended to_ but the side effects are just not worth it. My skin reacted to this pill horribly.

18, 3, Prevent pregnancy_ acne cure,None the first time (except clear skin)_ 2nd time I'm severely bloated_ breakouts_ weight gain_ nauseous.,I went on the pill when I was 17 and don't recall any side effects. I had bad acne at first but it cleared up eventually. The last several years my skin has been perfect. I went off the pill in July because I was out of the country. Didn't get my period for 3 months_ dropped a cup-size_ and lost 10 lbs. When I finally got my period I started breaking out like crazy. 6 months after stopping the pill_ my skin is the worst it's been in 10 yrs_ had my first ever yeast infection_ and my first abnormal pap. Decided to go back on the pill_ been on it for about 2 weeks. Skin worse than ever_ the most bloated I've ever been in my life_ nauseous all the time_ increased appetite_ and weight gain. I've been reading that side effects should go away within 3 months so gonna stick with it but so far this sucks.,F,27,10  years,1/28/2015,Ortho tri-cyclen
19, 3, Prevent pregnancy,Opon starting ortho tri cyclen I had little to no side effects aside from the common break through bleeding. About a month in I started noticing significant weight gain.. I was originally 98 lbs and gained almost 10lbs on the pill. The weight fluctuated but even after stopping it has been extremely hard to lose even with exercise when previously I never had such a problem. My appetite increased dramatically and I was retaining so much water. Also I had little to no sex drive which ultimately defeats the purpose of even being on birth control. Mild depression at times_ and I found myself not really interested and as upbeat as I used to be. After I stopped taking the pill within days I started feeling better_ and much more like myself. My metabolism returned to normal and I'm much happier. Also a much better sex drive. I suppose this pill is hit or miss if your willing to deal with the very minor side effects.,Effective at doing what it's supposed to: preventing pregnancy,F,19,9  months,1/28/2015,Ortho tri-cyclen

21, 2, Birth control_ period regulation,"Weight loss_ less acne_ boobs grew 2& 1/2 cups_ no cramps_ lighter more regulated period_ ""leveled"" mood swings_ took the joy out of life_ zero energy_ always tired_ depressed_ feel crazy_ over emotional etc",I started taking this BC in April of last year_ and everyone told me how great it was. No cramps_ it would help with my crazy mood swings_ virtually no acne_ a lighter more predictable period (the nurse told me it would be so predictable I'd know the exact hour it was going to start)_ and if I was one of the lucky ones_ it would even cause weight loss. It sounded absolutely wonderful_ and it worked great for the three month trial. Shortly after that_ I started noticing I had no joy in anything_ I didn't want to pick up a book_ play piano_ cook_ I couldn't even eat like I normally did. Every thing I ate made me feel sick to my stomach. I had zero energy and was completely depressed. My mood swings ere off the wall_ causing lots of strife in my relationships_ my boyfriend actually broke up with me because of these mood swings. I've never had a pregnancy scare with this_ my skin is flawless_ I lost 10 pounds while on it_ and went from a C cup to in between a DD and DDD.  While this works great in some areas_ it is total garbage otherwise. While this may work great for some_ it is not for me and I will be talking to my doctor about another option. I would not recommend taking this_ especially if you have had prior issues with depression and anxiety_ because this medicine will only make it worse.,F,17,8  months30MG,1/10/2015,Ortho tri-cyclen

43, 1, Prevent pregnancy,I've been on this pill for a while. I'm always feeling very depressed or just numb inside. I have the craziest mood swings all the time! I cry over absolutely anything. I get so emotional over things I sometimes want to cause harm on myself. It's affecting my relationship with the guy i've been with for three years because I snap at him over anything and he doesn't deserve it. I've had horrible acne since i've been on it which has been months and it has ruined my confidence completely. I never look anyone in the eye and I don't even want my boyfriend to look or touch my face. My sex drive decreased drastically. (which isn't completely bad but not completely good either)  I'm always tired now I never want to do anything ever but sit or lay down. I used to always be active running around everywhere having fun. My breasts seem to always hurt now also. I get bad headaches and Itch all over my body. I'm losing hair also but not to drastically. Well instead of going on and on i'll just say I have nearly every bad side effect that can happen with these pills. I can't wait to get off them.

I pick on my husband for every little thing_ and I have no patience. I was very irritable and also have no sex drive. The only thing this pill did was prevent pregnancy (I actually planned a pregnancy during taking this pill_ so I stopped taking it and it took 5 months to get pregnant) and it also kept my face very clear. (I washed my face only with water)After another recent haircut_ my hairdresser asked what medications I was taking. This was the only medication I was on_ so it was then that I figured it out.

I went down to 110 after having my son..and fast 120 before having him. Im not sure it had to do with this BC though because I am on an anti depressant. I have nos ex drive what so ever.

My periods *before* OTC- while painful- were very short_ and the intense pain lasted only through the first day. OTC made my period a long drawn out affair where I could barely function for 5 days due to pain (though it was slightly less intense than before)_ and my period was unusually heavy and 7 days long compared to my usual 3-4 days. I finally quit OTC (too late) when at the 5 months my breasts and thighs became terribly swollen. My diet is restricted due to a medical condition_ so it wasn't something I ate. Its been one month since I quit and my breasts/thighs have not improved yet. I went through a breast reduction surgery several years back_ so this breast size thing is quit literally my nightmare!

I was on Ortho tri cyclen lo for a year no problem_  in november I had a BAD PERIOD heavy bleading_ and clots galore. well around the 13th of december I had another period like that but heavier_ and I passed skme weird fleshy clot_ so I went to hospital. They told me I was having breaththrougj bleeding_ and I needed to switch to the regular Ortho tri cyclen (higher dose) went to planned parenthood and got it the nex day. I  took it for about 3 weeks_ and stopped cuz I all of a sudden could'nt breathe and it hurt. Ever since which has been about twoand a half weeks I have it all day long every day. So I went to the urgent care and that doctor gave me a xray_ and it was clear. But that doctor said that doesnt rule out clots_ and so he said I need to go to the the hospital and get  blood work_ an a CT. So they called the ER to let them know I was coming. And they did was listen to me with the stethoscope.  And check my blood. And said if the blood came back okay then they wont do the CT_ and if it came back with clots then they would give me the CT. Well the blood came back okay_ and I was thinking if I stopped taking this birth control for about 2 weeks now would there not be blood clots in my blood? but still be some in my lungs cause they don't really go away? Well they diagnosed me with apparently "" Asthma wih Accute exacerbation.""

Day one after taking the pill_ I woke up in the middle of the night_ unable to go back to sleep_ my mind just racing about the dumbest things possible. NOTHING I could say to myself could calm me down. Finally_ I feel back asleep.  I know it takes time for your body to get used to birth control but sometimes you have to know yourself better than the doctors.  If you think it's not right for you_ don't continue to take it!  I certainly cannot not function with a racing mind_ nervousness_ a feeling of floating_ and whatever else would come with the pill in the next 3 months! Yikes.

I took it for three months with not a single complaint or issue. Everything was great! No real weight gain_ my face was clearer than ever. Oddly enough_ during the 4th month_ I started spotting on day 15 of my pack. I went to see my doctor and explained my spotting issue and she changed me over to Ortho Cyclen the monophastic version of OTC.. which I am not ridiculously nervous about after reading everyone's terrible reviews. I figure_ though_ most people don't log on and rate/review unless they have issues with something.I'm upset I spotted on OTC-Lo_ I really really liked it.

I started taking this pill every evening before bed and noticed during sleep shifting from positions that I would be extremely dizzy.  In the morning I would wake up slightly nauseated but nonetheless didnt think it was due to the pill till I started reading all the comments. I thought maybe taking the pill during the day after a meal would make a difference_ but instead made me nauseous again and dizzy and want to just lay down for the symptoms to subside which im still feeling into the evening.  I would rather deal with my heavy flow than experience these symptoms that make me feel aweful! I cannot get pregnant due to tubal ligation_ so this was to help regulate periods. I am discontinuing use of this pill tomo and cant wait to flush out all the chemical from my body and return to my normal self again.  I will look for other alternatives to handle my heavy periods as I enter perimenopause. Maybe it works for others_ but in my case no.

For the first 6 months I only experienced the headaches_ breast tenderness and bloating.  After my 6 month checkup with my gyno (and after jinxing myself because I told her I liked this pill) I began to question my relationship with my wonderful boyfriend FOR NO REASON. I was also sad about everything and couldn't get exited anymore.  No motivation for anything and fatigue. Every month after that got worse until I finally came off one month ago. Bad ""withdrawal"" symptoms after coming off...my hormones are so out of whack.  I felt like I was going absolutely INSANE. I'm feeling a lot better but I've got a way to go before I'm back to normal. I will NEVER put synthetic hormones into my body again unless it's a life or death situation.",F,21,8  months 1X D,11/1/2011Email,Ortho tri-cyclen

161, 1, Birth control_ cramp control,EXTREME depression_ anxiety and moodswings,I was on Ortho for two months switching off of a different BC because of its side effects. From the first week of taking it_ I suffered anxiety - over-analyzing everything to the point of avoiding all contact with people because it made me so paranoid - and severe depression. Over the past two months its gotten worse every day to the point that I felt like a complete failure and I nearly dropped out of college. I thought I was going crazy; I started therapy and very nearly began taking anti-depressants because the depression was unbearable. Last night was the worst I had experienced - I cried for three hours without stopping_ for no apparent reason.

Once i started ortho tri cyclen low I felt fine.. about 6 months into it I became to have severe anxiety over everything. I would think so in depth about everything and literally get myself sick to my stomach. I wouldn't want to go to school_ go to work_ getting out of bed would take forever! I wouldn't enjoy anything because I was always worrying. I am currently seeing a therapist because of the anxiety this pill gives me. I didn't realize at first that the pill was doing this to me; I thought it was just me. I had no idea why any of this anxiety would even occur.. Now reading all of these reviews I feel the exact same way as everyone else. These pills are no good_ and I am coming off of them after this pack and I CANNOT WAIT! My boyfriend has been so supportive through all of my moodswings_ anxiety attacks_ depression_ fatigue_ not wanting to do anything or go anywhere_ etc. I am planning to throw a party when I'm done with these pills.. for real. I am ready to go back to the old me and enjoy life again. These pills will make you miserable and I beg you not to take them.. I wouldn't want anyone to feel the way I've been feeling.

I stopped taking the pill about 3 weeks ago because my fiance and I simply can not handle me having no sex drive and a dried up vagina.  It was horrible.

No matter what I eat or drink_ my stomach gets three times its size by bloating. I will randomly get nauseated and will not feel better til I start vomiting. I took it on an empty stomach once which I usually have no problem with but that day it made me extremely dizzy_ pale and blatantly began throwing up. Figured I'd eat a piece of toast to get some food in me but it came right back up. I was then nauseated the rest of the day. Also_ I've always been constipated but while on these_ I noticed I have no bowel movements at all. Not fun. There's never a moment when I don't want to sleep. The fatigue is rediculous. I don't feel like my old self at all_ since these I've felt bi polar as I'm fine one minute and RAGING the next_ over nothing.  I've been very bitchy and mean to a lot of people while on these and I used to be the COMPLETE opposite!!  I noticed just recently when I was off them for like ten days_ my stomach was normal_ I was going to the bathroom everyday . As soon as I started them again my stomach began bloating out HUGE again and I immediately didn't have bowel movements again!!!  Stopping this pill for good tomorrow!!!

I have no drive for anything_ ESPECIALLY sex.

Eventually I started having problems sleeping and depression. Within the last 2 months it has only gotten worse. I cry for no reason and find myself extremely sad. On top of it all are the aweful headaches and nausea every morning.  I hate feeling this way_ it's unbearable and it's not me.  My bf urged me to get help_ so I saw a therapist who said it's got to be the bc because I have no history of depression. If not for my bf_ who I'm amazed wants to stay with me and my crazy moods_ I don't think I would've realized what this pill is doing to my life.

IUD's are safer and more effective forms of birth control and you don't have to remember to take a pill every day. They also have less side effects.

Other than that I haven't noticed any mood changes_ spotting_ etc.,I started taking it because sometimes I would go 3 months without having a period and sometimes it would be every month.  Occasionally my periods would be 5 days but sometimes they would be 10.  My periods would always always always be accompanied by severe cramps and super heavy flow the first couple days that would prevent me from going to school.  Since starting Tri-nessa my periods have been regular and always start the Wednesday of the fourth week and end on the Sunday or Monday that I start the next pack.  I never have cramps like I used to (I mean_ there are still cramps but they are very manageable)_ and the acne that I used to have a horrible time controlling only resurfaces for a couple days a month.  I have read all the negative reviews of this pill and I must be one of the lucky ones that it works for.  Don't be discouraged if you read the negative reviews and don't want to take it because you may react well to it.  Everyone is different and there's not one pill that works well for everyone.  When I started Tri-nessa my gyno warned me that I may have to try a few types to find one that fit my body right_ but I was fortunate that Tri-nessa was the first and only one I have been on.  I know it can suck trying to find one that works_ but don't be discouraged (if you're considering starting it) and don't tell everyone to avoid this drug.(if you've had a negative experience).  It may be for you but it may not.  So it goes.,F,21,4  years 1X D,7/27/2011Email,Ortho tri-cyclen

First bc i've ever been on. I am about to start my inactive pills tomorrow (green ones) so I cannnot say what it will do for me period wise yet. The first day I took the pill later that night/early morning I got bad cramps and felt super dizzy_ and sick to my stomach_ however that was the worst of it. I've had some dizziness and fatigue every now and then but not much. I haven't notice any change in breast size besides my boyfriend telling me he thinks they've gotten bigger but I think he's just full of it (I wouldn't complain if there was though lol) I've had some spotting the past few days but only slightly. I think the only side effect I don't like is the mood swings but I'm hoping those will go away with due time. If anything at least only before my period. I haven't noticed anything to do with acne but I really don't think it would matter much_ my face has always been pretty damn clear.

178, 5, Birth Control,> NOT PREGNANT!!> regular_ light period.> some cramping.> PMS similar to severity prior to taking the pill. breakouts are about the same as prior.,So my doc prescribed me ortho tri-cyclen for bc purposes. Unfortunately_ I am a full time college student and my budget was only big enough for the $9 WalMart generic (TriSprentic). My doc mentioned that it may help with acne_ it would regulate my period_ and help me with the excrutiating cramps that I suffered from. She also advised that I remain on the pill for at least 3 months to allow the hormones to regulate within my system. I am now on my 5th month_ and I AM NOT PREGNANT!!! I'd really like to emphasize that point!! My acne didn't clear up_ my period IS regular and not as heavy_ and my cramps have improved substantially. As far as moodiness and depression_ I experienced some serious lows around my 2nd month on the pill and I was also having really sharp_ intense headaches between my 1st and 2nd months. But these subsided considerably after after 3 months. I'm still moody starting around the week prior to my period_ but it's nothing I cannot handle or had never experienced. Also_ my breasts have gotten about a cup size bigger and my sex drive has not changed at all (I asked my boyfriend to confirm). Overall_ this pill is GREAT!!! I AM NOT PREGNANT!!!! && my life has not been changed to any great extent!! I do feel bad for some of the women who have experienced negative side effects_ but honestly_ this is a hormonal regimen that is altering your body's natural hormonal rhythm_ so it should be expected to have some type of side effect.,F,21,  1X D,7/19/2011Email,Ortho tri-cyclen

She was definitely right because I stopped taking this pill about 3-4 months ago and have noticed a significant improvement within the past 1-2 months. My hair is going back to the way it used to be! Aside from the hair loss_ this pill also dramatically decreased my sex drive. Before_ I had a very high libido_ but this pill made it much lower and also caused a lot of vaginal dryness. Now that I'm off it_ I am back to my normal self again (and of course my bf couldn't be happier). I've read many_ many reviews in which people have the same complaints.

My WHOLE body is in pain and I can't stop crying.,My face HAS NOT cleared up at all_ even though it has just been a week and half... my face has gotten 110% worse. There isn't an inch on my face not blemished with acne. My body is in a weird state and my breasts are very very tender and I have no desire to move. My sexual drive is down to almost nothing.,F,18,8  days 1X D,3/26/2011Email,Ortho tri-cyclen
200, 5, Pregnancy prevention,Increased breast size,I first started taking Trinessa because I had a depo provera shot that caused me to bleed for 3 months straight. My doctor said that happened because I have a relatively low amount of estrogen in my body_ and it wasn't enough to stop the bleeding. My iron and nutrients plummeted from all the bleeding_ and I was so depressed all the time. I also gained weight_ although I hadn't changed anything about my diet or exercise routine. After about 4 or 5 days of taking Trinessa_ the bleeding had completely stopped_ and I was feeling as great as I did before taking the depo. I haven't had any  side effects with Trinessa--in fact_ my sex drive came back to how it used to be_ I felt better_ and I lost the weight I gained while the depo was in my system. I literally have no noticeable side effects from Trinessa_ with the exception of slightly larger breasts_ but I'm in no way complaining about that. I have to say though_ I don't know if many other women will have the exact same experience I have with Trinessa_ because I am extremely active. I engage in vigorous exercise 5 to 7 days a week_ which includes high intensity interval cardio_ and I do a lot of resistance weight training. Because of this_ I already had a low percentage of body fat (which minimizes my female hormones)_ I have a good muscle density_ I eat well_ and I'm consistent with maintaining my exercise schedule. I think this plays a fundamental role as to why I don't have any negative side effects,F,20,2  months 1X D,3/23/2011,Ortho tri-cyclen
201, 2, Contraceptive,I recently just started on my second pack of Ortho. So far_ I can honestly say that I am NOT impressed. I have been very moody_ and have been crying ALOT.

I needed a new check up so i went to the free clinic and they told me they would be putting me on ortho tri-cyclen that trinessa was the generic form so I shuoldnt have any side effects. But shortly after starting them I started to get severe migraines that would last for days_ Im currently having one that has had lasted for a week now. I get pains in my legs and arms that feel like there is something seriously wrong with me. I also have been very moody I snap at my husband for nothing_ in my head I try to justify it but I know that there was no reason for it. I just feel like this is takin over my life now_ if Im not laying in bed because of my head Im angry and wanting to be away from everyone including my own family. I have tried to read through most of these but didnt see anyone else saying they were having headaches to.

I'm 5'6''_ 125lbs and have consistantly stayed at that weight. i've been on this BC now for 7 years and am very satisfied. i think whatever BC you choose_ your body just has to get used to it_ at least that was the case with me.,F,24,7  years 1X D,3/8/2011,Ortho tri-cyclen

The only thing is_ is that i've noticed that i'm a little more irratable. I already have been diagnosed with anxiety. But i'm pretty sure the BC has intensified my irratibility.

You should try whatever works for you and if it doesnt_ switch. My best friend and I both take it. I LOVE it. My periods are very light and I have no cramping or bloating. I lost weight in my mid section but went up a cup size. Still lost weight though. I now have nice curves. However my friend gained weight and had occasional pimples. That just shows the effect of the pill on different people. The first month I was very moody and depressed. That went away. Its hard to get up in the morning but once i do get up i dont feel tired until around 10. I definitely recommend this pill.,F,17,7  months 1X D,1/27/2011,Ortho tri-cyclen
213, 3, prevent pregnancy and cysts,EXTREME irritability_ mood swings_ bloating_ no sex drive,The only reason I gave this drug a 3 rating was because it has prevented pregnancy and ovarian cysts.  Other than that_ I hate it.  I used to be so sweet and calm_ but since I started taking a generic form of Ortho Tri-Cyclen I am a raging bitch all the time.  I snap on my boyfriend almost everyday (unprovoked)_ but I feel like I can't help it.  I don't WANT to be this way!  I have no sex drive at all.  Previously_ I was on Yaz and loved it.  No adverse side effects whatsoever.  But due to lack of insurance coverage_ I couldn't afford to keep taking it ($70 per month).    Another thing I hate about this pill is the bloating.  For a whole week before my period_ I can barely button my jeans - miserable!  I haven't had any problems with spotting_ longer periods_ cramping_ etc. but that's a minor consolation compared to the other side effects effects.  I have an appointment with my doctor in a few weeks to change pills.,F,23,2  years1 tab 1X D,1/18/2011,Ortho tri-cyclen

I had horrible mood swings and absolutely no sex drive. I've never had bad acne_ but as soon as I was taking this BC I developed acne between my breasts. It was so awful. I took it for a little over 4 months before finally stopping. I lost a lot of weight_ no more mood swings or acne. I'd never recommend taking this birth control.,F,21,4  months 1X D,1/10/2011,Ortho tri-cyclen

216, 5, prevent pregnancy,possible hair thinning,"I started this pill when I was 18.  I think that my hair thinned on it (not bald_ just thinner)_ but then again_ I did not inherit a good hair gene from my parents. I believe that hair loss is a side effect of all BC pills.  This side effect was not out there in the late 80's and back then my female gynocologist  scoffed at me when I suggested the pill was causing it.  (I found a new doctor). Otherwise_ I had no complaints at all - no obvious side effects that I can attribute to the pill.  However_ if you miss a pill and have to double up_ you will get breakthrough bleeding.  A few years ago I tried a couple of different BC pills b/c of some breakthrough bleeding that turned out to be polyps and no relation to the pill.  What a nightmare!  The last one I was on was Apri (brand name - not sure of generic name) and it was dreadful - always starving and water weight retention.  At 44 I am taking a break from the pill_ but I have endometriosis and probably should go back on.  I am enjoying hormone free time_ but would choose this pill should I decide to go back on the pill.  I truly believe all women react differently to BC pills so there is no way to truly ""rate"" a pill until you try it yourself.  I am also happy that I cut my chances of ovarian cancer by about 40% by being on it b/c my mother died of ovarian cancer at 59.",F,44,18  years 1X D,1/5/2011,Ortho tri-cyclen

I always had the side effects of the pain in my left arm and chest_ but it was only every so often and only lasted for a minute or two at first but it got worse as time went on. Just in the last 2 years I have been getting terrible side effects_ to the point where I had to stop taking the pill in fear for my health. Since i stopped taking the pill however_ my acne has came back 10 folds_ so has the irribility and moodiness. I was not like this before the pill. Cons: Depression_ Mood swings_ painful sex_ lack of sex drive_ thoughts of suicide_ pain in left arm (numbness)_ crushing feeling in chest_ shortness in breath_ cryingPros: Regulated period_ decreased cramps and period in general.

Before I started taking this I couldn't keep my hands off my boyfriend_ but then I didn't want to be touched_ I some what dreaded sex because I couldn't get into it.,This was my second time taking the bc. Both times my sex drive decreased but that was my only side effect my first time. I do not recommend this bc to anyone.

I got incredibly irritable_ very VERY sad_ and then one day just went completely nuts over nothing at all.  I started crying uncontrolably and was having thoughts of killing myself in addition to rage and yelling_ basically had a major mental breakdown for no reason except for the fact that my hormones were completely messed up.  I began to feel like a completely different person and incredibly unhappy and no reason as to why I felt this way. BC affects everyone differently but there is no reason for a person to have to feel this way.

But I took a chance and I am so glad I did. The first few days of taking it my only side effect was the barest of spotting_ like a slight reddish tinge to the normal discharge I usually have. The next few days I felt a mild amount of water bloat_ mostly in my stomach. There was only one morning where I felt rather nauseaous_ but never threw up. Since about the 2nd or 3rd week though everything has gone back to completely normal. No bloating_ no nausea_ my skin is clear_ my period is barely there- absolutely no cramps and just a bit of blood (all i have to wear is a pantyliner to take care of it).

You cannot gain weight without eating more calories than you burn_ so simply cut back calories and work out. Also_ I do know that the hormones might genuinely be making some people crazy_ but I also believe there must be women out there who anticipate mood swings and therefore experience them because they have something legitimate to blame it on. My sex life with my boyfriend has been wonderful because I am able to relax and not worry about pregnancy.

I also experienced comorbid generalized anxiety disorder and the anti-depressant is used to treat this as well.

My mood swings were horrible.  By the end of my 4th pack I got a kidney infection_ which the dr told me was most likely from the pills.  It's not worth the side effects for me.

No motivation for school_ no motivation to look good_ no motivation for anyhting. I was sad and emotional about a lot of things and I was thought it was just me.

I had previously tried about 5 other pills and this one seemed to be the one. Then everything slowly went downhill. After about 6 months I am tired_ wake up nauseated during the night_ wake up drenched in sweat_ have to keep Tums on me all the time_ and feel generally sad about everything when I used to have such a positive outlook on my future and my future with my boyfriend. Around the 3rd week of pills tends to be the worst time. I get extremely angry/sad/suicidal and it lasts for about 2 days. Then I get all happy and manic but it's fake. This has put a strain on our relationship because I have turned into this venomous person. I am finishing this last pack and I plan to stop them.

Which was a total bummer_ because I was told it would minimize my small flare ups around that time of the month. Overall_ I'd reccomend this pill_ because most importantly_ I never got pregnant.

253, 1, birthcontrol,Depression_nausea_fatigue_migraines/headaches ,I have never took Birth Control in my life up until a good 7 months ago. For ANYONE who reads this I would highly advise you to never take Ortho Tri-Cyclen. The reason for me saying this is because I am a very active_ fun_ outgoing person and nothing could ever bring me down. Within the last 7 months I have been put in a deep depression and I wasn't sure why I was feeling this way. I have cried about everyday for no reason at all_ all I want to do is sleep_I cant seem to get out of bed. Just getting ready or going to the store is a hassle for me. The pill has given me a kidney infection and Tons of headaches. I feel sorry for anyone who has had to go threw such pain with this pill. I would rather be extremely sick in the hospital for a month than what I have felt with this pill for the past horrible 7 months.

I would be mean to my boyfriend alot and just get mad really fast and then really emotional and start crying. I gained about 20 pounds over the last 9 months and it sucks. I'm short so the weight is just harder to get off. I just got off the pill about a month ago and i have a late period but it says it could take up to 3 months to finally have a period.I have noticed my skin is breaking out and i am getting very oily skin which i hate the feeling of it in the morning.

Yeah I gained a few pounds but back then I was overweight_ and VERY lazy. I was always out with friends_ nothing changed. The extra cup size was a plus and the clear skin was amazing_ when I got off the pill at around 16 my breasts went back to an A and my face got all pimply again. I got off of it because I didn't need it anymore_ I wasn't having sex and my cramps went away.,This pill is not bad_ if it is bad for you then why the hell would you take it for more than a year if your gonna bitch and moan about it? Seriously_ what the hell lol. I'm looking forward to being put back on the pill so that I don't get pregnant.

My boobs are a little bit bigger_ but just like a cup. It's also really nice to know to the hour when my period's going to come_ so I don't need to fret before an event that it's going to come while I'm there or whatever.,F,18,  1X D,7/28/2010,Ortho tri-cyclen
291, 1, Sex and minor back/face acne,Crying_ negative thoughts_ weighted down_ anger,I have been on Ortho Tri Cyclen for a year and a half. Prior to taking the pill_ I was the happiest person you could imagine.. never had negative thoughts and always felt cheery and lucky to be alive. Since taking Ortho Tri Cyclen_ I have had so many mood swings. I am such a pessimist and cry all the time over things that never would have got to me before. I try to keep a positive attitude for my relationships sake_ but even so... I can tell I'm different than I used to be - faking happiness rather than being happy. Looking outside at a beautiful sky doesn't give me the same rush as before. Instead I think about all the negative things in life leaving me sad. I forgot to re-fill my perscription this last time and went off the pill for a month. True story - towards the end of that month I was feeling better than ever and so happy (hadn't had that feeling in so long).. the weigh was lifted. I went back ont the pill again this month and yesterday (about 8 days into the cycle) threw a huge rage in my car and then this morning cried all the way into work for nothing imparticular. I can't focus on anything positive. I am going off the pill and will have to use a new method of birth control and get back on acne meds... but positive outlook is way better than feeling dumpy!,F,26,  1X D,7/27/2010,Ortho tri-cyclen

337, 3, ,I used to take the pill from age 18-23. I think I have a pre-disposition to being anxious and depressed but taking this pill made me severely anxious and depressed! I was switched to four different anti-depressants during this time_ which helped a lot and my skin_ which used to have acne_ cleared up COMPLETELY. Once my insurance ran out_ I stopped the anti-depressant and the bcp (tri[-sprintec). My acne came back but my severe depression lifted somewhat. With my new insurance_ and with the encouragement of my current boyfriend_ I decided to try the bcp again. I'm hoping my acne will go away. I've been on it for 16 days_ and my depression and anxiety are BAD again! I'm also getting hormonal breakouts. I'm going to my doctor to see what I can do. I never realized the bcp was making my depression and anxiety worse. But if it helps my acne like it did before and it obviously helps prevent pregnancy_ I will stick with it.

I started dated a new guy in college who forced me to get back on the pill. So_ I tried Alesse. I instantly gained weight_ felt bloated_ and was hysterical all the time-sobbing and felt like a mess. Everyone noticed. So_ I switched to ortho tri cyclen lo and it was AWESOME!!! Went on the Ring just to try it and that made me spotty and stinky down there. It was also too expensive and Planned Parenthood didn't offer it. So_ I went back to ortho tri cyclen at 21 and have been on it for the past three years. I started to notice problems when I moved to FL. I've been to a rheumatologist and a neurologist to try and make sense of this.

Months 2&3 was a non-stop period. I had a period for 2 months straight. My nausea and cramps worsened to the point where I was missing school and curled up in my bathroom for hours at a time. Medicines and hot compresses/showers did not help at all. Within 2 days of starting Ortho Tri Cyclen_ my period stopped. When the inactive pills on the fourth week came around_ it was as if my period was totally regulated right then. My body adjusted to this pill within 2 days. I've had no weight gain. I've actually been able to lose more now when I exercise. My cramps and nausea are completely gone_ so I'm now able to target foods/drinks that make me sick. I absolutely love this pill and I plan to stay on it for as long as I am able to.

349, 3, Period Regulation,Possibly upset stomach_ bloating_ irregular bleeding worsening,I began taking Ortho Tri cyclen LO about 15 days ago.  Doc put me on it to try and regulate my periods.  I had a heavy flow for 8 months straight with no break.  All tests are coming back normal except a 2cm cyst on my right ovary.  I took Ortho back about 5 yrs ago and loved it.  had no problems with it_ then again_ at that point i was on it for pregnancy prevention cause my periods were already like clock work.  Shortly after starting this first pack of pills_ I started feeling off.  About week 2 started the nausea and bloating.  the Nausea gets really bad at times and makes me eating pretty much not wanted cause as soon as I eat_ I wanna get sick.  The bloating comes and goes_ nothing worse than a mild period bloating (I've had worse on my period).  Now the bleeding is whats got me confused.  Before starting these pills my period had finally stopped and vanished for 3 months.  I started on the day I was to start the pill.  Had a normal 5 day flow (man was i excited) then 3 days later_ started again.  I know break through bleeding is common in the first month so I'm still hangin in there.  But when you just went 8 months with no break_ you start getting scared that its gonna happen again.  My point_ ladies dont give up.  I once loved these pills_ dont quit just cause you get a little sick.  Pepto is my best friend right now but I know its the best out there.  If it doesnt start getting better by pack 2 then I'll start calling my doc but until then_ wish for the best :),F,26,15  days 1X D,4/14/2010,Ortho tri-cyclen

Within the past month ive been being a complete bitch to my boyfriend that cheated on me a few moths ago and our relationship has been a little rocky.  But within the past month things have gotten really bad and ive been an emotional reck.  At first i thought it was because I couldnt forgive him for what he did but I was getting way too mad way too sad way too fast and ALL THE TIME!  I always feel depressed and that this relationship is going nowhere and im not doing anything with my life.  This was so weird to me because I am usually a really happy person.  So i called the advice nurse and she said it is very normal to have intense mood swings your first month_ especially when you switch off another pill and that it should regulate within the next few months.

I have been taking this for 6 months now and after reading this site_ I finally realized this was because of the pill. I had began feeling unhappy about anything in my life when I had nothing to be sad about. I am a very upbeat person and I have with time more and more depressed. I cry 3-4 times a day over nothing and most recently had a panic attack. I was hysertical crying_ my hands and face went numb_ I couldn't breathe or talk_ and I had no control over my actions. I pushed my boyfriend away from me for no reason_ my friends_ my family. This is such a relief to know that this is why this was all happening to me. DO NOT TAKE THIS PILL! I am seeing my doctor today to switch it.,F,22,6  months 1X D,2/9/2010,Ortho tri-cyclen
382, 2, yes,extreme mood swings_ depression_ sworness in the breast_ weight  and fatigued,im usually not the one to leave comments_ im always reading them and making my decisions based on the comments left by others.  but i couldnt resist this one because ive experienced almost every side effect listed on this site with the worst being my extreme mood swings_ not wanting to be bothered with my boyfriend when he's and amazing man to me. constantly irriated and wanting to break up.  then crying_ crying_ crying all the time. im sure my bf felt i was a one woman freak show with all my different emotions.  i never would have equated my irritation and meaness to this pill until again i broke up with my bf today over the dumbest thing and he asked me if the b.c. was messing with my emotions.  i decided to google the side effects of otc-lo and came across this site and what a big releif to know that im not alone.  i love my man soooo much and almost lost him due to this pill. after finding the site i printed the comments and gave him a copy and told him how sorry i was and i think majority of my anger_depression_ crying and extreme mood swings had to do with the pill and he instanly said we'll get you off and find out how to go from here. im getting off this pill and will talk to my doctor about switching to something else.  thaks to all the women out there who has shared.  i plan to update next month after being off the pill.,F,26,1  years 1X D,2/8/2010Email,Ortho tri-cyclen

As a birth control_ OTC Lo it works great...but mainly because I feel too disgusted with myself to let my boyfriend touch me. I don't know if I've gained weight because I haven't weighed myself_ but I feel like I have. I'm tired all the time_ and have no motivation to do anything. I've also been really moody. Normally I'm an emotionally stable person and really happy_ but lately I don't feel like me and just about anything will make me cry. I love spending time with my boyfriend_ but since I switched I just want to be left alone. I'll finish out the month on the pill_ but am switching back to the patch. The patch only messed with my body_ not my moods. I'm tired of being constantly tired_ and I just want to feel like me again.,F,21,10  days,2/2/2010Email,Ortho tri-cyclen
388, 3, Horrible cramps,CONS---- I am 19 and I started taking this pill in the morning and I would ALWAYS feel really blah_ nauseated_ and after about an hour of that I would eventually throw up! I haven't vomited since I was literally 6!!!! This happened several times in the first few weeks. I would also cry over everything and feel really sad. I started taking the pill at night because it would always make me sick if I took it in the mornings_ and it worked. I was on my period for about a month after switching from morning to night. I did stop getting sick after that. 8 months after taking it my breasts got really sore for about 3 days and I couldn't wear a bra. I do get medium cramps the day I start but I am thankful for that because I use to have them for the whole week and have to stay in bed. I often get headaches due to bright lights and etcNOTE: EVERYONE WILL GET SYMPTOMS IF THEY DO NOT TAKE THE PILL EVERYDAY WITHIN THE SAME HOUR!,PROS---- being nauseated went away_ cramps went away 90%_ period lightened_ mood evened out after the 3 month_...,F,19,9  months,2/1/2010,Ortho tri-cyclen

My period was a little iffy starting off_ but once my body got used to it_ my period is easy to predict. The main reason why I am not giving it a 5 is because one month I did not have my period at all_ and then the next month is was right on schedule_ so that was a weird fluke. Other than that_ I like it a lot.,F,19,7  months,1/25/2010,Ortho tri-cyclen
392, 1, Switching to BCP for skin,fatigue_ depression_ bloating_ moodiness,I switched from Alesse to Ortho Tricyclen Lo (tri-lo-sprintec is what the pharmacy gave me) on the recommendation of my dermatologist because it is suposedly better for acne_ which I have currently had a problem with.  I have been on it for a week and have been miserable.  Extremely fatigued_ depressed_ moody_ I cry all the time_ and feel extremely bloated despite working out every day and eating healthy as I usually do.  It is extremely out of character for me to feel this way and I am stopping it immediately.  I wish I had never switched because now I will have to screw up my cycle until I get my next period and can switch back to my old birth control.  Basically it makes me feel crazy and my boyfriend is a saint for putting up with me this week.  Stay away from this pill.  Also_ I have actually broken out more rather than having it clear up my skin_ which is the only reason I switched to it originally.,F,26,6  days,1/23/2010Email,Ortho tri-cyclen
393, 4, Heavy and long periods,A little nausea for the first week_ crackers helped.,I'm taking tri-lo-sprintec_ the generic for ortho lo.  I had a lot of anxiety because of all these bad reviews.  Apparently_ only people with negative experiences write in.  Granted_ I've only been on it for three weeks but i've had no side effects.  No weight gain_ no mood swings_ no shedding of hair_ no migraines_ no tenderness in my breasts_ nothing.  My period was also shorter and lighter.  I have tried a lot of different birth control pills but so far_ this one is great.,F,34,3  weeks,1/22/2010,Ortho tri-cyclen
394, 3, my period_ duh?,I know I'm young. I started taking Ortho tri-cyclen when I was 12_ even with a small dose_ I noticed some weird side effects. My period wasn't as heavy_ but still very painful_ just as long_ and I got many migrains still. I used to have it to the point where I couldn't go to school_ and I couldn't MOVE; so it did help me out a little bit. It didn't really seem to do much_ and it made me really cranky. For all the older adults and teens out there_ I'm in the same boat as you. Time for a prescription change!,,F,13,12  months,1/22/2010,Ortho tri-cyclen
395, 5, Birth control,Regular periods_ cleared up acne,I was on Trinessa (generic brand) for 5 months. Before I started taking Trinessa_ I was such a happy and kind person.. as soon as I started taking it_ I was having constant mood-swings. I would get mad over nothing and was constantly depressed and irritated. In addition to that_ my knees hurt and my feet were always swollen to the point that it was painful to wear even flipflops. The ENTIRE time I took Trinessa_ I was constantly sick.. ear infections_ flu_ colds_ pneumonia_ bronchitis_ dental issues.. it was one thing after another and everytime it seemed a medicine was working_ something else would flair up. I am generally a healthy person and don't get sick often_ so this was strange for me. I decided to get the brand name one month because the generics were out of stock and I didn't want to wait.. within one week of taking the brand name Ortho Tri-Cyclen_ I wasn't sick anymore and didn't feel depressed. The swelling went away in my feet and I wasn't sore or moody. My boyfriend and several family members have mentioned how they noticed a change in my attitude and mood. Now_ months later_ I still feel great and back to myself. I had read reviews on this site before_ but didn't think that the generic could be that different from the brand name.. but the BRAND NAME IS DIFFERENT FROM THE GENERIC. Trinessa on my insurance is $10_ OrthoTri is $30. I will GLADLY pay the 20 extra bucks for my and my boyfriend's sanity!,F,21,9  months,1/21/2010,Ortho tri-cyclen
396, 2, Birth Control,5 pound weight gain in 19 days_ cramping_ extreme fatigue_ depression_ bleeding for 2 weeks straight.,This actually makes no sense because I was on the pill when I was younger and had no real issue. Off for about 5 years. Just started out 2 mos. ago again_ first with Tri Sprintec and had consistent cramping_ bleeding and fatigue. I asked my Dr. to switch me to Tri-cyclen LO thinking the lower hormones might help and I thought I was better for about a week. All of a sudden the symptoms returned with a vengeance as the hormones increased.  And I gained 5 pounds! (I weigh myself consistently and track what I eat and exercise.) I definitely noticed an increase in appetite as well_ but not enough to account for 5 lbs! (Mostly in the boob and booty area...nice). The big problem_ though_ was just how tired_ depressed and bloated around the belly I became. I suppose maybe some people adjust to this_ but I am going to find a non-hormonal contraceptive. I don't want my body to adjust to this. It's not normal!,F,39,60  days,1/21/2010Email,Ortho tri-cyclen

And I already have been feeling tired and wanting to go to bed at 11pm instead of later like what I usually do. I also wake up in the middle of night nauseated. Plus when I do get up in the morning_ I feel so sick to my stomach I have to eat something or I feel like I will vomit. I've been having cramps as well. I'm glad I found this website and I can see that I'm not alone!

I lost my sex drive and am extremely irritable and tired all the time. I also feel bloated and depressed more than normal. The first birth control pill I tried was the regular ortho tri cyclen years ago and had none of the above symptoms. I went off it for many years and when I chose to go back on to birth control_ I couldn't remember if I had been on the regular or the lo version so I told them to give me lo. I will be seeing the doc tomorrow to tell her about my symptoms and go on the regular version of the pill. I'm hoping this will clear up all my negative symptoms. Thanks to everyone for their reviews.  I thought I was going crazy!,F,34,36  days,1/13/2010,Ortho tri-cyclen
402, 4, ,Migraines_ nausea for the very first week.,I used this pill for about 9-12 months. I thought it was ok. I was put on it because I couldn't take a whole lot of estrogen. It definitely took away the crazy moodyness I had with the last few pills I was on. I've always had 3 day periods so it didn't change that at all. I didn't experience any weight gain due to the pill. I did_ however_ start gaining weight after I graduated in May because I took up a sedentary job for 8 hours a day (I joined a gym for that). It did decrease my cramping on periods but towards the last few months I started to get crippling migraines so I'm switching to Loestrin24 fe. I have no idea how it's gonna affect me. I'm kinda scared to change over. But enough is enough with the darn migraines. We'll see how the change goes_ but if it's not smooth_ I will be changing back to ortho tri-cyclen lo and getting onto a migraine medicine. Over all_ it's not so bad. Whoever is looking at all these terrible reviews_ most people that have bad experiences come online and complain. The people that have good experiences don't even check online because they don't need answers to questions they don't have. All BC works differently with every woman so give it a try and if you don't like it_ move on.,F,17,10  months,1/12/2010Email,Ortho tri-cyclen

I had minimal to no side effects from Yaz but got nervous with all the health warnings so I asked my Dr. to change my BC. I immediately gained weight (10 lbs in two months)_ all I want to do is sleep or cry and I have terrible headaches. My left breast swelled to twice its normal size and was extremely tender. Once I got my period_ the breast returned to normal but I don't want that to happen again next month! I have even missed work from feeling so terrible. I have a very decreased sex drive. The way this pill has affected me is taking a toll on my marriage. I called my doctor after one month of feeling this way and she said to give it a month or two more in order to adjust but I just can't take it anymore. I have three pills left in this pack and then I am going to stop taking the pill.  I am thinking of trying a barrier method for BC.

422, 2, Birth Control,depression_ mood swings_ decreased sex drive_ loss of appetite... (basically about the same kinds of things most other people have been saying on here),I just quit taking OTC Lo after a year because my mood swings have grown out of control. I still don't know why but I now suspect it may have something to do with this BC pill... After reading about other people's experiences with this drug I realized that I was not alone. Most of the responses I've read say exactly how I've been feeling. The only differences are the physical ones. I never experienced cramps_ headaches_ naseau or anything like that but honestly I'd gladly take the physical pain over the mental anguish any day. It's only been about a day and half since I quit so it's still way too early to tell but I'll let you all know in about a month or two if I have noticed any major differences.,M,19,1  years,12/10/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

424, 1, birth control,Less acne_ sore breasts_ ZERO sex drive :( _ crazy depression taken out mostly on my boyfriend_ feeling completely empty inside_ crying nearly all the time for no reason,I went on OTC Lo 3 months ago.  I used to be on Loestren_ but switched to OTC Lo due to breakthrough bleeding.  WHAT A MISTAKE.  This Birth Control actually ruined my life.  It made me extremely depressed...I cried myself to sleep about 5 out of 7 nights per week over NOTHING. I also had absolutely no interest in sex with my boyfriend_ in fact I was repulsed at the thought of it.  We used to have sex every single day about 2 to 3 times a day.  After this pill_ we did it about 5 times in 3 months.  He broke up with me last week because he couldn't understand why I was so depressed and he was exhausted trying to figure it out.  He said it was a problem that I couldn't communicate to him what was wrong with me.  He was scared about what my nonexistent sex drive meant about our relationship.Then I talked to a friend about it and she asked what BC i was on.  all of the sudden it made sense.  She was on this drug too and it messed her up in the same ways. DO NOT TAKE THIS. IT RUINS EVERYTHING,F,21,3  months,12/8/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

426, 2, Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo,I'm iritable_ noticed an increase in acne_ and I have no sex drive at all.,The worst thing that i've experienced is the fact that I have no sex drive. My mind wants it but my body doesn't care_ I never get aroused anymore with my boyfriend or by myself and I know it's because of this stupid birth control. I'm getting off of it when this pack is up. I miss wanting sex and i'm scared that I won't get aroused again_ which i'm sure I will when my natural hormones are in balance. It has caused a big strain for me and my boyfriend...he feels so helpless. Screw this birth control.,F,18,7  months,12/6/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen
427, 1, Birth Control/Acne,Depressed_ tired_ bitchy_ mean_ irrational,I started taking OTC at the beginning of my new school semester. I had transferred schools and moved away from home. I thought that I was just dealing with a lot of changes_ instead I finally figured out my birth control was driving me to be a huge bitch_ I felt like breaking up with my bf all the time (i love him to death) and i eat ALL the time. Im usually a really healthy eater but now I like don't give a damn. It hasn't done a thing for my acne either. i also have negative sex drive. and im usually wanting it everyday and minute. i also cannot become lubricated whatsoever which has NEVER been an issue in my life.,F,22,4  months,12/6/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

I am definitely considering switching back and highly recommend this pill to anyone who has severe side-effects_ because I tend to and this worked amazing for me.,F,28,6  years,12/4/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen
429, 2, Acne,Thank you all the women who have posted here..I too thought I was alone n now I know it's not me_ it's what I've done to me. I was so excited to get BC because I'd had bad acne for at least 7 years n I was told it was hormonal. The first few months I was happy with it. I don't recall any weird bleeding or anything_ and my skin has never been this clear_ but recently I've been a completely different person. My bf and I argue about the dumbest stuff and he sometimes even questions if he knows me anymore. Anyone out there who loves their man knows how badly that can hurt. I snap on him in an instant about NOTHING and cry cry CRY all the damn time! I have NEVER IN MY LIFE cried as much as I have been. We can't even deal with other issues n our relationship because I cry about EVERYTHING so he says he never knows when something really bothers me or not. I'm so moody all the time also!

At first I was on Yaz for endometriosis and that made me really nauseous and irritable_ so my gyn put me on OTC because it's such a lower dose_ but after two months of taking it_ I felt so bad that I didn't know what to do. At first I thought I was going crazy--I was anxious for no reason at all and couldn't deal with school. I'm really not an anxious person at all and this pill really made me feel like I was dying.

When I was a lot younger I took bc for the same reason--Yaz_ Lo-Ovral--and those pills gave me an overall bloated feeling and made me gain weight.

The second week i was ok and didn't really have any problems_ and now the third week i feel really depressed and all i want to do is mope around my room and sleep all day. It has also dried out my skin but for me that's a good thing because i usually have extremely oily skin. I also lose my appetite really quickly and have an extremely increased sex drive.,I haven't been on it for that long so I'm going to give it a little more time and see if it gets better because I heard it's supposed to_ but if it doesn't I'm switching.,F,18,3  weeks,11/10/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

Sex is horribly painful_ and this has never been an issue before two months ago.  I've had no other issues thus far other then i was on my period for two weeks during the first month_ but that hasn't been the case this month.

I have surprisingly been pretty up-beat and not really had any emotional side effects. On the second sunday of taking the pill_ however I noticed a strange smell. I have researched this pill and found other women have had the same problems but am still praying that it goes away. It gets a little less noticeable after a shower but I have never had bad odor down there before so I noticed it right away! It has seemed to clear up my acne and acne scars which I am thrilled about. I think I am going to stick with it for the first 3 months unless the bleeding or odor worsens.,F,21,12  days,11/4/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen
443, 3, Help reduce the size of a cyst,Change in body odor!! Stomach issues_ nausea,I had not taken birth control for many years but after finding out I had a fairly big cyst on my ovary my Dr. put me on OTCLo for 3 months to shrink it. I am on my second month and I can't wait to get off of it. If it wasn't for this cyst I would not be on any birth control. I am always nauseas and I have such a foul odor when I sweat coming from my pits. I am a very hygenic person and I cannot deal with BO. I am not sure about weight gain but I have noticed that my stomach is always bloated. I usually suffer from depression even when I am not on the pill so not much has changed there. On th positive side_ I do not get as many headaches as I used to get and I no longer have clotting during my periods. My periods are much lighter.,F,31,2  months,11/4/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen
444, 1, birth control,Nausea in the beginning_ Migraines_ Super long periods_ spotting_ random depression,I took this pill first when I was about 19. I had a lot of intermittent spotting then_ but didn't think it was from the pill. I recently started taking it again. I am depressed once a month_ cry for no reason. The first month_ my period lasted 26days_ full period-not spotting. Since then_ I've had periods for 14_ 16_ and 8 days within 2 months. After a while_ you lose count. The cramps are better_ without the pill_ my cramps make me want to rip out my insides. Slight vaginal dryness_ no noticeable change in sex-drive_ no weight gain -  but it doesn't help clear my acne at all as it suggests. Overall_ I'm miserable and got switched to Ortho Novum_ but haven't started yet. After reading the posts_ I may just stick to the misery from this pill. The depression only lasts for two days and since I know what it is and when it's going away_ I can deal a little better. I don't recommend this at all though.,F,26,5  months,10/31/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

446, 3, prevent pregnancy,I started on OTC in July of 2004. I didn't experience side effects but I stopped taking OTC and switched to ortho-tricyclen lo because the fill in doctor I saw at the time was concerned when I mentioned my mother had a blood clot when she was on birth control. So while on OTC-lo from 2005-2007_ I noticed during most of 2006 my hair seemed to be either falling out or stopped growing. My boyfriend also complained that I tasted differently when he would go down on me_ when I know there wasn't a problem before. I hadn't changed my diet and tried to think of what I was taking that could be interfering and the only thing I had been taking was OTC-lo. So I went off of it for a couple of months but couldn't stand the fear of getting pregnant. So after speaking with my gyn doctor_ she switched me to Aviane in the fall of 2007. From September 2007 to Spring 2008_ I noticed that every time my boyfriend and I would have sex_ it hurt when he would first thrust in me and during intercourse it didn't,It may work for some women_ but I guess my body isn't able to handle the hormonal changes it causes. I'm not bashing birth control. It's a great_ liberating creation and allows women to have a life that they weren't able to before but if it's causing more negative side effects than positive_ it's important to make sure that what you're feeling is being caused by it because after all it is your body and you have a right to live healthier.,F,27,7  months,10/27/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

Ever since I can not lose weight_ even though I exercise everyday and eat well (except for a once and awhile treat) I can't lose the friggin weight. My Endocrinologist said it could be because of the male hormone in my pill and suggested going on Yasmin_ but with everything in the news about the health problems associated with Yasmin_ I don't know what the frick to think.,,M,36,15  years,10/20/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

My fiance and I decided on a short engagement- only 4 months so I really had no choice but to get on Birth Control quick.  A friend suggested Ortho Tri-cyclen lo to me so I hoped for the best.  The first month seemed fine but the second month was when all the negative side-effects kicked in.  My sadness and irritability and emptiness just didn't add up_ comparing to the extreme happiness I was experiencing just a few weeks before even amidst the crazy wedding planning.  I was about to break off my engagement until I starting thinking it might be the BC.  When I found this site_ I felt a deep relief that it wasn't just me.  Thanks so much for sharing_ now I know I'm not crazy_ and I will not be taking this pill anymore.  I might just be switching to spermicide when we get married.,M,25,2  months,10/19/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen
454, 1, Pregnancy Prevention,I honestly don't know why I didn't think of this earlier_ but many women have posted side-effects that make them feel exactly the same I do everyday...Tired_ extremely moody_ constant hunger followed by obvious weight gain_ did I mention moody? Along with dry eyes_ dry skin_ acne_ crying for no reason_ biting people's heads off_ OMG the list goes on and on! I had been taking Ortho-tricyclen for about 3 years previously and the side effects were tolerable_ but I have recently switched to the tri-lo sprintec because of insurance...I have experienced almost every side effect listed on this site. I'm not usually a person who overanalyzes things_ but I get so flippin irritated for no reason_ then I get sad because I feel guilty for yelling at either my boyfriend_ my best friend...I work as a receptionist and I swear I thought it was just stress from my job wearing me out. I feel so much less crazy now that I know other people are feeling the same way!,I will be calling my doctor for an appointment right away to change my prescription! I'm so glad that everyone is sharing their experiences because like I said I would have never thought to attribute my symptoms to my pill. I came across this site because I was trying to research why I was spotting brown discharge at odd times during the month_ along with cramps_ weight gain around my stomach...it is so noticeable that people have even begun to ask me if I was pregnant! That is followed by extreme depression because I look like a fat pig! My boyfriend has spent many nights on the couch or in the spare bedroom because I refuse to let him touch me which upsets me even more because I just end up thinking he's going to cheat on me anyway!,F,26,5  months,10/19/2009Email,Ortho tri-cyclen

I am sick to my stomach for the first week of the pack_ feel okay mid month_ and then get horrible back cramps before the period and during. My sex drive is low and it sucks because I'm with the man of my dreams. I'm tired. I'm low. What else can I do? Condoms dont work for him_ he can't get an erection. I'm hanging by a thread here.

I have never been so depressed in my life.  I started analyzing every little thing and over thinking everything and having anxiety attacks.  I hated this pill and because of what this pill has done to me I'm not even switching to another kind of birth control because it really messes with your hormones.  I even thought about seeing a counselor because of what this pill caused.  So to all the girls out there that think they are going crazy  if your on ortho tri cyclen its probably it because this birth control can really mess with your emotions and feelings.,F,20,6  months,10/5/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

I'm having a little break through bleeding but I am so depressed.  I have bouts of the blues but never like this.  I feel so hopeless and I had no idea why and then it hit me!  I left a message for my doctor this morning about switching me back to Yaz.  They took me off Yaz because I wasn't getting my period at all on it.  I was on Yazmin for about 5 years before Yaz and the only problem I had was blurred vision on the first day of my period.  I would take that any day over the way I feel right now!,,F,30,11  days,9/23/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

I knew there was something off with me but I couldnt figure out why I was actin like this out of nowhere until something hit me and I realized it was the OTC!,I cant say how well it worked as a birth control cuz I actually didnt have much sex while on it but I did have spotting for like 3-4 days before I got my actual period which 2 me felt like a 10 day period & although my cramps were way more bareable they lasted for damn near the whole 10 days which was not cool! Now that im off it I feel way betta and back to my old self.,F,24,3  months,9/22/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

473, 2, Birth control,Extreme moodiness_ light bleeding and cramps for 2 weeks so far_ acne cleared up,I took Yasmin for almost 5 years_ but it began to 'stop' working for me.  I was having 7-8 day periods and heavy cramping_ so I switched to Yaz.  Yaz brought on 8-10 day periods and heavy cramping as well.  I went off birth control all together for 5 months_ then got put on Trinessa.  After 1 month of being on this_ I am not very happy.  I have had light_ consistent bleeding and cramping for 2 weeks now.  This started at week 2 of the package.  I just had my period 2 weeks prior to this.  My emotions are out of control as well.  The smallest things piss me off beyond control or make me want to scream/cry.  The only good thing I've experienced is my acne cleared up.  I am going to give this stuff 3 months_ and if it doesn't improve_ I'm going off birth control pills all together again.,F,27,1  months,9/21/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen
474, 1, to prevent pregnancy,I've been taking ortho tri-cyclen lo for 10 months now and it has been a good pill for giving me regular periods_ which come like clockwork and for clearing my acne_ but this is where the good parts stop. This is the first birth control pill that I have been on so I didn't exactly know what to expect and what was normal. Being on the pill I have mimicked every symptom of pregnancy including food cravings_ having to pee all the time_ breast tenderness and have been nauseous. During my time on the pill I have gained 18 pounds and have had intense food cravings and feel the need to eat all of the time. I have also become incredibly moody_ little things set me off and it seems to intensify the little problems that I have. As well as flying off the handle I have become incredibly depressed and don't even want to go out to spend time with people anymore. My boyfriend and I used to get along great but now it seems like we do more fighting than ever and its all over little stupid things,,F,,10  months,9/21/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

I vomited frequently_ had terrible food cravings (which for the most part I didnt give in to-however_ I still gained 10 pounds.  Never felt more bloated in my life.  Never felt more irritable in my life.  Was on the generic of this for 3 months_ switched to generic Ortho Tri LO hoping that would help- was on it for a week and a half and took myself off because it was far worse than anything I have ever experienced.

I have had 4 periods in less than 2 months_ and each one is worse than the last.  These side-effects I listed just don't make it worth it to stay on this medicine.

The last two months ive been on the generic form and it is ten times worse:(  Ive turned into a crying monster!  I cry cry cry for no reason. Ive started my period four days too soon and that is unusual for me.  the dr said give it time and oh ya its not the pill_ I know it is! Im happy with my life and as far as my life goes things have been great.  but for some reason the smallest thing sets me off now!  i  will either get set off with tears or snap at you!! Im not like that but with this pill i am... what should i do/?  i did go with the cooper iud a year ago; i got so infected it fell out!! what a waste of money that was.  im tierd all the time.  im tiered of saying im tiered then going to bed and not sleeping.  But most of all im tiered of crying over stuff i shouldnt be crying over!!  Example:  Me and my 8 year daughter was driving in the car and i asked to sing the song that was playing on the radio.  she said no and i started crying and even had to pull over to the side of the road.  Thats not right!!!  And i thought that the name brand had some bad side effects....I WAS WRONG!! THE GENERIC OF ORTHRTRICYLIN LO IS 100 TIMES WORSE!!  I dont know what to do.,F,30,6  years,9/8/2009Email,Ortho tri-cyclen

I've decided to stop taking it even though I get it for free through the family wavier program. It's not worth what it's doing to my body.

I had no problems with it during this period of time. I just started taking it again this month and have had horrible side effects. I am cranky all the time_ bloated_ my breats are swollen and tender and I have HORRIBLE bleeding.

486, 1, birthcontrol,Depression_ Anxiety_ Craziness,I had a horrible panic attack towards the end of my fifth pack_ I suffered from anxiety and panic attacks before but hadn't had one in three years. I started my period and was fine that entire week started a new pack and my panic was out of control. Followed by depression and suicidal thoughts. My father is a physician and told me to get off the pills. The first three months off i suffered from depression_ anxiety_ headaches_ dizzy spells_ insomnia_ heart palpitations_ and a few stomach problems. I went to see a therapist because i had become crazy i dont know how my poor boyfriend stayed with me. its been four months since stopping and I am almost completley myself again some of my symptoms appear again a few days before my period_ but its getting better after each period.

487, 1, Birth control_ clear up mild acne,Depression_ mood swings_ anxiety_ weight gain_ nervousness_ severe irritability_ cravings_ fatigue_ drowsiness_ cramps_ excessive crying_ very unstable mood and behavior.,I was on OTC for about 5 years and I was great. It was my first choice when I wanted to get back on the Pill because I had a great experience. My doctor put me on Lo (just finished my 3rd month) and things have gotten out of control. I thought I was losing my mind_ and that's scary. I noticed that I'd been crying daily (at the drop of a hat) but I figured it was because my boyfriend had decided to take a job overseas and we'd be apart for a few months. I knew I was supposed to be emotional_ but I felt insane. Over the past few weeks_ I have nearly lost my mind. Depression_ not wanting to be around anyone_ paranoia_ AWFUL mood swings multiple times a day_ suddenly sobbing (it doesn't matter where or when)_ irrational thoughts and behavior_intense cravings for fish (I was eating it at 530am) and I even got hysterical over a very basic situation. This is not me. I've been slamming everything around at my desk_ it's been hard to handle even slightly stressful situations! I go from happy to completely bawling in about 5 seconds. My boyfriend thinks I have lost my mind and there's nothing he can do. I was so glad to read about this because I really thought I was going crazy. I can't believe how I've isolated myself and how I snap at people_ even my family and boss. I feel so bad but once I even start to get emotional_ I snap and it escalates so quickly. I used to be so calm and funny. I stopped this pill yesterday and will never touch it again.,F,24,3  months,8/29/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

489, 1, Pregnancy Prevention,[Tri-Sprintec] Weight Gain_ Acne_ Irritability_ Insomnia_ Increased Appetite_ Hair Loss_ Breast Pain_ Loss of Libido,"I was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen about five years ago with absolutely no problems - but I was put on this generic form because my insurance doesn't cover the ""real deal.""  I have gained around 20 pounds in the past three months and I'm constantly bloated.  The weight has been gained mostly in my stomach [ew!].  I have THE worst acne I've had in years - with NO change in my diet or hygiene routine.  It centers mostly on my chin and jaw line.  I am incredibly irritable and will take anything as an insult - I will also cry at the drop of a hat.  I haven't been able to sleep since I've begun this birth control.  I am so tired all the time_ but when it comes to actually sleeping_ I am so full of anxiety - and pent up ""anger"" from the day - I have fought with my fiance every single night since I started this medication.  For the stupidest things!  Like_ leaving a sock on the floor - I would NEVER have done that before - it's ridiculous!  I have also gone from having a thick head of hair to having thin hair.  It literally falls out in clumps.  And while the pain isn't nearly as bad as it was on Yaz (which I was on before this)_ my breasts are so painful.  I found this website a month ago when I was looking for ways to alleviate the breast tenderness.  And on top of all this_ I've also lost ANY interest in sex whatsoever.  Yes_ gaining weight_ becoming a pizza face_ and having painful breasts do dampen a woman's desire to make love with her fiance.  BUT.

The only side effect I ever experienced was when I missed a pill and had to double-up_ I would feel nauseated.  Other than that_ everything was good.  I just could not handle the price since I lost my insurance.  I decided to try OTC because it was half the price.  I have been taking OTC for 2 months now and the side effects are not worth it.  I am going back as soon as this pack is over.  With Yasmin_ my periods were light and almost no cramping.  My first period on OTC was HORRIBLE!  Cramping started the week before_ heavy bleeding.  My vision is always blurry_ and when I looked on their website_ the inability to wear contacts is listed as a side effect.  Going back to Yasmin ASAP.,F,34,2  months,8/19/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen
491, 5, Pregnancy prevention,Decreased appetite,I have to say that this pill has helped me in so many ways. I feel that this pill has helped with my depression_ I'm not eating as much as I used to and have lost a bit of weight_ my breasts are slightly bigger_ my period is lighter_ I have not cramps_ and my acne is nearly cleared. Not to mention more exciting sex without worrying so much about pregnancy.,F,20,5  months,8/18/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

I was originally on Apri_ but it gave me very bad headaches_ so I eventually switch to Ortho Tri Lo.  Thinking about it now_ I would take my bad headaches from Apri any day over the insane side effects I get from Ortho Tri Lo.  I used to the least emotional person on the planet... I used to never cry_ never get depressed or anxious_ and in the past year I've been on Ortho Tri Lo I have become an emotional basket case. I cry over NOTHING_ and I'm constantly anxious.  I also crave food 24/7.  It goes back and forth between chocolate_ chips & cheese_ but I'm almost always craving something.  I want to eat all the time!  I haven't gained much weight since taking this (only about 3-5 pounds)_ but it's really annoying how much I want to eat all the time.  Anyway_ I'm going to stop taking this pill as soon as I see my doctor.  I might stop taking BC all together and allow my body to naturally go through the cycle.  I'll probably feel a lot better.PS: Thanks for all the posts!  It makes me feel a lot better knowing that I'm not the only one having issues with this pill!,F,23,1  years,8/15/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen
493, 5, Birth Control,Mild nausea if I didn't eat anything with it for more than 12 hours.,Been taking it for 10 years without a single problem.  The only draw-back is if you're a crybaby who takes drugs for every little problem or a slut who doesn't use condoms and gets STD's a lot_ because certain drugs and antibiotics can neutralize the effects of the pill.

My breasts are HUGE which is nice but they are extremely sore and sensitive. I am getting married this October and am working out like crazy and eating well and I feel puffy (like I have an extra thick layer added to my body_ especially my belly and thighs). I have been moody and mean which is not like me at all. I have noticed my hair thinning and thought it was from my highlights but now I believe it is related to this birth control. I feel tired_ nauseous_ headaches_ anxiety and dizziness. I am so thankful other girls posting their experiences...girl power :) because I honestly didn't realize these things were related to ortho low until I started doing research. It is so scary how this can affect your mind_ body and spirit. I am stopping this birth control tom....Thanks!,F,24,3  months,8/10/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

My new insurance and service provider didn't provide Ortho Tri-cylen Lo and I had to switch to Ortho Tric-Cyclen.

498, 2, Contraceptive,Extremely extremely tired_ loss of motivation_ and loss of sex drive_ so far.,I just started back on Birth Control_ but I think I'm 100% done with taking it.  I was on the generic version of Levlen which I was on from 18-22yrs of age.  Never realized it made me a mean person until I was off of it_ more importantly it might have caused me to have a servere blood disorder that prevented me from clotting.  from 22 - 27 I have been off and on birth control with no success.  Seasonique is HORRIBLE! I seems that the older I become the less torrible my body is to oral contraceptives.  With Ortho Tri-Cyclen low_ I'm having a hard time staying awake this week.  I've gone to bed early and it doesn't  help.  I've been a steady work out regim which I've missed two days of because I'm so tired.

While I did take this pill_ this had been the first time that I had taken a Birth control; and I would have rather have did with out because the side effects are not worth the effort of taking the pill.I was only 17 yrs old and had a bad taste of birth control experience and it made it hard to make the leap again to find something that worked out.,F,19,2  months,7/28/2009Email,Ortho tri-cyclen
504, 1, to prevent cramps,I was on the birth control from Fall of 2003-March of 2005.  I was fine for about the first year of taking other Tri-Cylen Low_ but it got to the point where it no longer did anything for me. I tried to kill myself freshman year of college_ but I realized it was a bad idea I had two heavy periods a month_ complete with cramps and everything.  I had_ had enough of this and called my boyfriend at the time.  He called my mom and I had to be taken to the doctor.  They did a few tests to see what was wrong_ but they found nothing wrong with me and switched kinds to Yasmin.About two years ago I went off of birth control all together.  I thought everything was fine until i puked all over myself in the car.  My husband took me to the ER and it was discovered that I had a huge cyst.For those  of you who don't know cysts are what cause bad cramps.

I also got acne_ which I never have.  My boobs were extremely sensitive.  I was always hungry and extremely tired ALL THE TIME.  My libido was greatly diminished_ and my vagina was always dry.

Eventually I lost 5 pounds but I also started getting bad headaches EVERYDAY.  I was never really tired or had any problems with libido. So bc of my headaches_ I switched to nuvaring which I absolutely hated because I ended up gaining 10-15 more pounds and made me extremely tired all of the time. So I switched back to OTC Lo and my weight has remained the same but Im only on my 3rd pack so im hoping I will drop some pounds like last time_ but I was still getting the same headaches everyday. The food cravings are insane_ but it helps if i drink alot of water and I've also been taking the pill at night before I go to bed and I havn't been having as many headaches through the day as I was when I was taking the pill in the morning. Im also very tired alot_ I can have a good night sleep of 9 hrs and get so tired that I have to take a nap during the day.  Slight loss of libido.,F,20,3  months,7/22/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

Thank you for everyone posting their opinions and experiences with this pill b/c it has opened my eyes. I have been having such a hard time with falling asleep lately_ increased anxiety_ and ohmygod_ the week before I get my period has become increasingly worse. I don't get my period till next week but I wake up feeling like S.H.I.T. Sick to my stomach with ongoing cramps..it's just not worth it. My sex drive is still there but not by much_ I don't really enjoy it anymore. I have been on Alesse before this_but due to intense menstrual migraines I have been switched to OTC-lo.On a positive note OTC-lo have helped with the migraines. I don't get them as frequently_ or as intense. I have 2 packs of OTC-lo left before I have to make an Appt with the doctor and I will have to see if I can try another brand. It's just so frustrating since we all react differently_ I don't want another negative reaction! As much as I want to just stay off the pill completely_ Condoms just aren't that convenient so there really isn't anything I can do.

I actually began to think I somehow ended up pregnant due to the switch because I immediately started getting headaches and they were severe_ every night for 2 weeks.  I also became bloated and irritable.  That's not the worst of it_ I have lost control toward my husband screaming uncontrollably.  I felt like I was losing my mind and actually thought about ending it all.  NEVER have I felt like this and now reading these comments I will never take OTC lo again.  I would rather waste the $125 I spent on a 3 month prescription than feel like this.  ,F,33,28  days,7/20/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen
511, 1, Prevent Pregnancy,WEIGHT GAIN_ anxiety_ depression_ headaches,I have been taking this pill for about 2 years. That is until 2 nights ago. I will never ever take it again. I had always had complete control over my mind.. my thoughts. Shortly after taking them I noticed I was having horrible thoughts in my head and severe depression. I never connected it to the pill until I started to research and found a lot of other girls were having the same problems while taking this pill. Also_ everytime I would start a new pack it felt like I put an extra layer of skin on. It made me puffy and bloated. I gained overall 20 pounds in 2 years and have been dieting and exercising. It is impossible for me to lose. It made me hungry all the time.I even talked to my doctor about these problems and was told that I just needed to exersise and birth control was very good for the body. It's just a big scam. I never had the guts to get off of it until now. I'm getting married in March and I just want my body and mind back. Now i'm just praying that my body will be back to regulating soon. I have read on support groups that it takes up to a year for your period to come back..,F,20,2  years,7/18/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen
512, 2, ,Weight gain_ depression_ mood swings_ panic attacks.,This pill made me a freaking lunatic! I took it for 6 months and it completely changed the person I was. I would freak out over nothing at all and cry over the drop of a pen. It started to interfere with my work and relationship. I just dealt with it for awhile until I started gaining weight drastically. I have been on a strict diet for 2 years and lost 75 pounds and I was not about to let that go to waste by taking this psycho pill. So I've been off it 2 weeks now and feel totally great. My relationship with my boyfriend is 100% improved and hopefully I can get back down to my initial weight. After about the third month I also started having panic attacks for no reason. They would occur at least one a week and since I quit I haven't had a single one.,F,19,6  months,7/17/2009Email,Ortho tri-cyclen

514, 2, Birth Control_ Weight Loss,Severe Cramping for days at a time_ No period_ Mood Swings_ Crying for no apparent reason_ Yeast Infection,I just switched from Depo-Provera last month to lose the weight I gained from the depo. 40 pounds with no change in eating on a different bc with my wedding coming up was depressing. Anyways_ I went through the whole months supply and started to take the middle set of pills that are basically used to remind you to take your pills during your period. On the second to last hormone induced pill I started getting severe cramps I mean the kind where you lay in bed crying your eyes out thinking that any moment you may vomit the contents of your stomach onto the floor. I have had these every night for the past four days and I still haven't gotten my period. I also asked my fiance if anything had changed about me in the past month and he said I have gotten very emotionally unstable. I cry because of anyhting now it is pathetic. I really wish I would have stayed on the Depo shot because honestly I would rather have weight gain from the shot or even get pregnant by not being on birth control than be on this pill. It is horrible. I hate it. Honestly I would rather get pregnant.,F,20,1  months,7/14/2009Email,Ortho tri-cyclen

518, 2, birth control,spotting_ light dizziness_ headache,I just started taking ortho tri cyclen LO less than a week and a half ago.  I took a generic BC pill for 2 years that worked fine_ I gained some weight on that (was also in a new relationship though) and my breasts got bigger (which wasn't necessary) and other than that really had no complaints.  My new Dr. suggested moving to a lower hormone Rx so I switched to Ortho tri-cyclen lo.  2 nights ago i fell asleep before I took my pill at the usual hour_ woke up 6 hours later and took it...and then today I experienced spotting_ which NEVER happened to me on my generic brand.  Plus I've also felt a bit dizzy when standing up and have had headaches....it's been less than a week and a half so I dont know if this should be related to the new BC_ but after reading some of the other posts I'm getting suspicious....also I am praying that I don't gain weight_ because I'm trying to lose a few pounds for an upcoming wedding--yikes :-/,F,22,10  days,6/24/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

I choose this one and when i went to Walgreens specifically said to not give me the generic.. they didn't so yay.  my next shot is supposed to be sometime in August_ but the Gyno said that I can start the pills anytime I want .. she said that they would help with hot flashes. and anger.. depression.. and yadda.. so I've been on it for 5 days and I haven't noticed anything.. but I'm on the depo and the pill right now.. So i feel like i'm over 100% covered lol.. anyhow.. I can't tell if I'm having side effects from the pill or depo.. but so far I don't feel anything except for the normal side effects I had from the depo_ the hot flashes are getting better so yippee.. ..

I was sick_ anxious_ and depressed to the point of being suicidal. I also had no sex drive--in fact_ it was quite painful. My doctor wanted me to try a low dose BC_ so she put me on OTC Lo. All of my symptoms disappeared_ and my sex drive went through the roof. I feel like a teenager again. The only downside is that I'm hungry all the time during the first two weeks_ so I've had a little weight gain_ but nothing uncomfortable.,F,26,2  months,6/22/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

I feel like I have been going crazy!! I was very regular and never had cramps (which I am thankful for) before taking the pill. The first few months I was on it I have bad migraines and cramps so bad I couldn't get out of bed! I have been constipated the entire time and my sex drive decreased shortly after taking it. On top of my normal diet I even HAVE to take supplemental fiber to help with the constipation!  I also started gaining weight very quickly and the diet and exercise that has always worked for me just hasn't. I have been in a range of the same 10 pounds for as long as I can remember (well 10 years and before that I was smaller) and now I am 2 sizes bigger! I often tear over things that make no sense like commercials which is CRAZY! I have never been a crier and what I'm tearing up about isn't even important :-/  I can tell my body has adjusted a little over time bc the headaches are not as often although annoying and I still have random cramping throughout the month although not sooo intense but now the anxiety that I had early on has turned to depression. I wish I had found this forum sooner bc I wouldn't have felt alone. I have felt out of control. I am stopping the pill and I will update again. I want to feel like myself! I have too much to be thankful for like a wonderful husband and am too blessed to feel sad_ depressed and moody!,F,27,15  months,6/18/2009Email,Ortho tri-cyclen
524, 4, ,migraines_ weight gain,"I was taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen  then i was switched to Ortho Tri-Cyclen LO -- began having migraines every day at the exact same time and it lasted from 10 am until about 4 am the following morning. The  migraines were debilitating. I was bed-ridden and completely miserable EVERYDAY for 6 months! I wanted to kill myself.  I went thru all the drugs for migraines_ went to a pain rehabilitation center_ monitored everything i did to find the trigger_ but nothing was any help. the drs said it could not be the pill - bit i was skeptical - especially since I had the headaches at the exact same time every DAY!  I take the pill at a certain time at the same time every DAY! - Well_ finally I decided to take myself off the pill- It was useless since I was in too much much pain to need it anyway! The 1st day I was off -- the headache still came_ but at a later part of the day and it ended much earlier as well...the following day_ just a normal headache...on day 3...NO HEADACHE..and so I got on the Mirena (IUD)- was on it for 3 years_ until I developed nabothian cysts on my cervix which was also ""unrelated to the birth control""... but strangely_ have had no more problem since I had it removed...hmmm...however_ I am back on the Ortho Tri-Cyclen now_ and the headaches have returned_ not as severe as before and I have gained weight - I'd say about 15 pounds and Ive only been on it 4 months and I exercise daily and eat healthy as a rabbit...so I KNOW ITS THE PILL.",F,29, ,6/16/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen
525, 4, Birth Control and Menstrual Cycle,low sex-drive_ vaginal dryness,I first started out with the Ortho Tri-Cyclen_ then switched to the Lo version. While taking this pill (I believe for a couple years)_ I didn't have too many issues with it. I cramped less on my periods. But I noticed that now that I'm off of it (needed a new prescription and no longer sexually active) my periods are actually shorter than when I was on the pill. And as a birth control_ it worked perfectly. My only problems with it were that I had almost no sex drive at all_ and even when I did_ it would take forever to orgasm. And plus sex was difficult because I would get very dry down there. When I return to taking Birth Control_ I might try a different kinda to see if that doesn't help with the low libido problem.,F,22,2  years,6/14/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

Close to the 2nd year of taking it_ I fell into a bad and difficult depression.  I would burst in tears for no reason_ be sad and mad in a flash.  So I started taking anti-depressants_ which helped_ but I had to figure out why I was having depression symptoms while I'd never had medical problems or any reason to have it.  Thanks to this website I didn't feel alone and I finally understood what was causing my depression.

About 1.5 years into taking it_ I started to get the brain fog and dizziness but I didn't connect it to the pill (my doctor misdiagnosed it as vasovagal syncope).

I saw a different doctor for my migraines.  I of course had to stop the combo pill to avoid getting a stroke_ but they also suggested going off pills entirely.

This medicine makes me snap in an instant. Yesterday I got mad because he ate the last toaster strudel. It made me go ballistic. I ended up in a crying_ shaking anxiety attack. I normally am a completely level-headed_ easy going person. When I go into one of these ""crazy"" spells I can feel that it isn't me_ but I can't stop it. It scares me so much.

When my insurance company put me on Tri-Nessa my skin started freaking out and I just felt moody all the time. So now I am on the OTC Brand name_ going into my second month.

560, 3, Ovarian Cyst?,I am always cranky and everything annoys me very easily. I am tired a lot. It hasn't helped much with acne but it did help with my cyst I never feel pains in my stomach anymore. It did regulate my period a lot even though I still don't know exactly when I will have it. I don't get cramps near as bad as I used too. I don't think i've gained much weight if at all.. I have noticed though that im hungry all the time but nothing seems appetizing so I very rarely actually eat and some of my favorite foods are my least favorite now :(,I really think the side effects vary per person so you can't necessarily take my opinion about it.. I just got on here to see if anybody else had the same side effects as me because i've been wondering if it was the birth control doing it at all.,F,19,5  months,3/30/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen
561, 1, To help regulate periods.,This pill was not for me. I was on it for eight months and it made me extreamly violent and angry all the time. I was sad more then usual and went to the extent of thinking about suicide. It made my acne worse and did not even make my period regular or light. I do not recamend it but it may be the pill for someone else. I am now starting yaz so hopefully this works. And even off the ortho tryci low i am still easily irritated and sad now but not as bad as when i was on that pill.

Was really moody_ got in a fight with my boyfriend_ physically I was extremely nauseous. After a couple days I calmed down_ and now I have less mood fluctuations than usual. But at the same time I feel like my personality went away too. I figured out that the nausea goes away as long as I eat something beforehand. I have no sex drive_ and flirt a lot less_ which earns me less in tips at work.No decrease in blood flow during my period_ and the first one was longer than a week. This month I forgot the first pill of week 3_ and took it less than an hour and a half later_ but I bled that whole week_ and had my usual period the next week.Did clear up my skin.,F,20,3  months,3/23/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen
565, 1, Birth control,I have found myself to be a person that can not tolerate hormonal birth control. I was on this medication for about a year and a half when I went off because I felt it was making me more irritable_ anxious_ and also making my eyes dry. Two weeks later_ the stuff really hit the fan. I began having horrible_ long_ uncontrollable panic attacks. Along with this_ my heart rate went up and would not go down. I was diagnosed with tachycardia by a cardiologist who said my troubles all stemmed from having been on and then going off of the Pill. In trying to deal with all the chaos my body was going through due to my natural progesterone production being compromised by taking the Pill_ I was put on Ativan (which is another horrible_ dangerous drug which it took me 16 months to wean off of [after 4 months of use]). I was also put on Celexa (SSRI)_ which I am about to start weaning from.

Then I was lashing out at everybody and crying all the time. I never cried alot before_ and now my boyfriend looks at me crosseyed and I bawl.

It made the cramping far less_ but I can't stand being this depressed all the damn time.,I took ortho lo for 3 years with no problem until it just seemed like it was becomming less effective. I was put on normal ortho to regulate my cramps but I've been miserable. I feel depressed and sore and tired constantly. I have no desire to ever leave my house and I get migraines daily. I was so worried I was going to seek mental help. I'm stopping this b.c. immediatly before I explode or loose all my friends because they're sick of me crying every damned day.If anyone has any insight to this_ PLEASE email me.

I have only been on it for one month so am yet to see how my periods will be this month.

I was taking it to help my acne and for a birth control.  It made me into a whole different person..a very crabby and moody person. I also have not seen a difference with my acne. I also feel tired and lazy all day long.  Also_ i randomly get hot flashes and start sweating for no reason_ even if it's cold out. I live in duluth minnesota so it's always freezing here!

By the third month_ only the first white pill of the pack made me vomit. After six months it finally stopped.When I first started taking the pill_ I had a very high sex drive (horny ALL the time). After a few months (four or five)_ I gradually lost interest in sex as a physical pleasure. I have a very hard time climaxing_ and I don't ever feel like having sex with my husband_ whom I love and am extremely attracted to. I enjoy it only because of the intimacy_ not because of the physical aspect.I'm thinking of trying a new contraceptive altogether to see if I can change this.,F,22,10  months,3/11/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

I feel like crap all the time_ not so much depression as just physical exhaustion and feeling ill all the time. As soon as I'm done this pill pack I'm moving on to something else...hopefully it'll work out better. I figure 5 months was enough time to make it work,F,21,5  months,3/8/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

The acne is still here.. and I'm not happy with any one of these BC_ but I depend on them because you can't always trust a condom. I need something new for sure.  I may switch back to the LO cause at least with that my mood was stable and I lost weight.,F,27,8  months,3/7/2009Email,Ortho tri-cyclen

I used to have very irregular_ heavy periods and now it comes like clockwork and is light to moderate.  I gained 3 or 5 pounds when I first started taking Ortho 11 years ago but have no weight issues now.  If anything I have become dependent on it because I am afraid to stop taking it and have my period go back to the way it was.,F,30,11  years,3/5/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen
582, 1, lessen cramps_ regulate periods,depression_ anxiety_ insomnia_ weight gain_ loss of motivation_ extreme spotting.,The first month was fine. I did experience anxiety and depression_ but it lessened what is usually a heavy period with limited cramping. About a week and a half into the second month_ I started getting a full on period. It has not stopped and I'm still 2 days away from the placebo pills. I cramp up_ can't sleep at night due to anxiety. When I do sleep_ its for about 3 hours at a time and I've gained 10 lbs. I have been a complete hermit and snap at my partner for any little comment. I'm generally very unsatisfied with this type of birth control. I stop today.,F,26,2  months,3/2/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen
583, 5, Acne cure_ menstrual regulation,Mild water weight gain in breasts_ weakened knee joints,This drug has helped me GREATLY! A nobel award should be given to whoever invented this. Throughout my life_ I've suffered from both severe menstrual cramping and severe acne. Thanks to Ortho-Tri Cyclen_ my acne is cured and it is rare that I actually experience a cramp during my period. I also love the fact that it does regulate your menstrual cycle. I've never experienced any mood swings on this pill. I only wish I would have started taking this pill since I first started menstration. The only side effect that I dislike about Ortho is that it does make you physically a bit more suceptible to injury during intense athletic training.,F,24,3  years,2/27/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

589, 4, Birth Control,bloating_ breast tenderness_ but also shorter periods and clear skin :) no mood swings or weight gain!,I started taking tri-sprintec mid-cycle a month ago_ as recommended by my nurse since I had to take Plan B a few days before and was already pumped full of hormones. It was also cheap (co-pay was $10 for three cycles). I had a bit of bloating for the first week or so_ but none of the scary_ crazy side effects other people reported. My breasts were tender for a while_ but they also got slightly fuller which is great for flat girls like me. I had no break-through bleeding or spotting (period came on day 4 of the inactive pills) despite starting it two weeks into my previous cycle and if anything_ my sex drive has gone up because I don't have to worry as much about pregnancy. I've never had much of an acne problem_ but whatever spots I had on my face before are now gradually disappearing!,F,18,1  months,2/18/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

Since I started the pill I have been extemely depressed...sleeping all the time_ crying at the drop of a hat_ and very moody.  My poor husband!  My anxiety has come back with a vengance as well.  I have also gained 10 pounds and am an avid runner and haven't changed anything about my workouts or diet.  I'm always hungry.

I stopped taking it basically because it was really tempting to have sex but we wanted to wait. I've been off of it for 6 months now and  I'll be going back on it in the next few months and using it for birth control rather than acne now that I've grown out of my acne! yay! If you take a look_ the active ingredients in the generic brands and the brand name ones are the SAME. Also_ look at who makes the generics...it's often the brand name company themselves but with cheaper packaging etc.  The generics are usually approved by the brands themselves. Basically there shouldn't be much of a difference between the brand and the different generics.  This is based on personal research as well as discussions with 2 doctors and numerous pharmacists.

Big mistake!!  I had huge mood swings.  I ranged from severely depressed_ not wanting to get out bed_ sleeping _ crying jags _ and ANGRY to feeling OK on the off week.   My  poor husband and kids thought I was crazy.  I thought I was crazy!! My acne returned with a vengeance.  Not just on my face but on my back_ chest where I never had any!!  I have taken BCP's on & off for many years and NEVER had this type of reaction.  I kept trying to figure out why I felt this way and the only that changed in my life was the change of BCPs to Trinessa.  This website confirmed my suspicions.thank you!  I spoke to my pharmacist and he is going to reorder Tri-Sprintec for me.  I have been on/off BCPs for many years and have NEVER EVER felt the way Trinessa made me feel.

I became depressed and lost alot of weight_ but with time_ adjusted to the hormones and was fine after that.  I was on ortho and generic ortho for about 9 years and recently switched to the Ortho-Lo (only b/c I needed pills and they had samples at the doc).  This is my 3rd or 4th month on Ortho-Lo and I swear it made me gain weight.  I didn't notice as many physchological/emotional side-effects nut definitely increase weight gain and I work-out all the time and for the most part (minus alcohol) eat healthy.I have heard of many other girls complain of weight-gain w/ Ortho-Lo.  I don't think there is any scientific evidence to prove this to be factual_ but each person's body is different.  I noticed weight gain particularly in the mid-section.  I think I'm gonna switch back to regular ortho when I finsish these samples.. we'll see if I lose some weight.,,F,28,10  years,2/10/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

So first and foremost that is why I started and I am still on a BC pill. But I've come to learn the many_ many benefits of the birth control pill. Otho Tri-Cyclen and Ortho Tri-Cyclen lo - It did what I expected. When I am not on a BC pill I get terrible pelvic pain_ (I'm assuming cysts_ just from prior doc visits)I would get terrible cramps_ periods that lasted way too long. And my complexion wasn't the greatest. Ortho Tri-cyclen lo- (that's what I was on most recently_ but I have been on Ortho Tri-Cyclen as well as 2 other kinds) I have shorter_ lighter periods while on it. No pelvic pain. Great complexion. However_ I have been extremely moody and sensitive... more than usual. I am now assuming I need to try and switch to a different pill. I'm not sure if I'm suffering from PMDD or if this is a side affect from Ortho Tri-cyclen lo. I don't want to give it a bad rap without knowing for sur,F,28,4  months,2/8/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

I guess I have had a slight decrease in sex drive_ but not to the extreme that other people have had.  I also gained about 15 pounds over the first 2 years I was on it_ and then I have maintained weight since then.  This pill has done wonders for lightening/shortening my period because I used to have it horrible in the past.

I thought it'd go away_ but it lasted 3 months before I got tired of waiting and switched birth control.I also was always able to taste it and didn't mind at first.

When I started taking them again_ I was perscribed Trinessa.  Since then _ I have no desire for sex.  I know BCPs can cause side effects but_ since I had no problems in the past and the formulation is supposed to be the same_ I didn't suspect that my low libido was due to the Trinessa.  After taking Trinessa for a year_ I decided not take BCPs due to my age and health risks. I only found this site because I googled ""how long will it take me to get my period after I quit taking Trinessa?"".  It was only then that I realized the Trinessa could be behind my lack of interest in sex.  It has now been 2-3 months since I quit taking the meds and my sex drive has not returned.

I was then prescribed Tri-Sprintec at 20 because I _myself_ couldn't afford the $50 copay. Back in June_ I was having issues with bad cramps_ headache and breakouts. My doctor prescribed me Loestrin. It made me CRAZY. I would cry at the drop of a hat (I am not an emotional person) I would bitch everyone out (coworkers and family). I was anxious all the time and felt like i was crawling out of my skin.  Went back to Tri-sprintec_ felt like a human being again and finally got my body used to it (although_ my face didnt recover from the hormones in Loestrin) and then I was informed that my insurance was no longer convering maintenance drugs and i would have to change to Trinessa. I freaked. After my experience with Loestrin I was scared to try it. I have been on it 4 days.. havent experienced the craziness that i had with Loestrin_ but I am gaining weight like crazy_ but my skin is FINALLY clearing up.,F,24,7  years,1/22/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

I was taking Zovia 1/35 (generic for Demulen) and it was great for my skin.  No side effects_ sometimes I was just overwhelmingly stressed out and felt crazy_ however I have 3 kids and am 3 months postpartum_ any other time I didn't experience that and I was taking it off and on for 7 years.  I decided to try the LO version of ortho tri-cyclen and the low amount of Estrogen is making me tired and I am very anxious... I hate that feeling.  I also read that not enough estrogen makes you tired and it's the progestin component that causes moods_ so I will be switching back to Demulen and if it does not work will either try Ovcon_ Brecicon or Ortho-cept.

I have loving parents_ a great home_ good grades_ sport teams_ wonderful friends_ and an incredible boyfriend. Nothing is wrong with my life right now and nothing is even complaint worthy. I started taking TriNessa not for sex but to control my period because I was getting it twice a month and was therefore iron deficit. Then I started feeling a little down_ not motivated_ sad. Then I started to get this overwhelming sense of doom_ like my life was on an extreme downturn_ but nothing had changed. I don't have any history of depression but I would have been clinically diagnosed as depressed because I would go to bed crying and wake up crying and had this sense of hopelessness and despair. I almost asked my boyfriend to take a break even though he is the most amazing guy ever until I figured out that it was the trinessa. there is something seriously messed up with this medication and I would advise all to use this with extreme caution.,F,18,60  days,1/21/2009,Ortho tri-cyclen

Then i started to become mean like wanting to argue with my husband and anyone. Sometimes i would cry over the stupidest things. Finally the migranes just kept coming and nothing would take them away. I went to my doc and asked her if it could be the bc but she said no and game me lexapro for my mood swings wich didn't do anything_ and a CT scan of my brain wich came back normal. i Have since stoped taking it and have not yet had a migrane and feel happier.

I read online about how awful trinessa was but decided to tough it out anyways. I could not even make it through a whole week on Tri-nessa because it made me so incredibly sick. By day 3 I was so nauseous that I would have to stop exercising when I went to the gym_ and I had to miss school on day 5 because I was in so much pain. Last night (day 6) I woke up at 2 am and sat in the bathroom gagging for 3 hours and could not go back to sleep. Along with the nausea_ I had some incredible mood swings where I would be cheerful and giddy for maybe 15 minutes and then lethargic and grumpy for the next couple of hours. It was really a dreadful experience_ and I refuse to take any more of these pills.

In fact_ my normal flow is 8 days every 21 days and on this pill its about 5 days every 25 days_ so improved. Never got sick with it_ though I'm not really sensitive to hormones (didn't get sick with pregnancy either). I didn't gain any weight on it and didn't get any extra breast tenderness. Actually_ I'm having to switch to Yaz in an attempt to control panic attacks (not BC related) with the extra progesterone. Decided to leave a positive comment about Trinessa after I researched Yaz and saw nothing but bad paranoid comments_ researched this and basically the same (I suddenly realized no one decides to rate unless they have a negative reason to).

It has been fantastic in both regards_ but in the last year I've experienced horrendous PMS (mood swings_ depression_ irritability_ extreme tearfulness) and also depression between periods. When I figured out that the birth control was the problem and I wasn't just crazy_ I switched to something with a lower estrogen dosage--which admittedly had its own problems_ but I felt saner almost instantly. I also lost about 10 pounds without even meaning to_ which makes me think Ortho-TriCyclen was causing some weight gain.

I am constantly tired_ needing a lot of sleep_ I have severe headaches and major cramping during the third week of the pack especially.

641, 5, clear skin,Breakthrough bleeding during month two for the first week.  So we will see what happens during month 3.,Okay_ here is the deal.  I am a nurse.  Ortho Tri-cyclen has TWO generics:  Trinessa AND Tri-Sprintec.  Orthocyclen has a generic also_ called SPRINTEC.  Please do your research online using a reliable database_ such as CVS_ and do not post information about pills that you do not understand.

Menstrual like cramps_,I have heard people say give it 3 months and you will be fine and everything will work itself out_ but its not worth it_ I have 3 kids to care for and my husband worries when I am all emotional_ I feel like crap_ dont like to have my flow for 3 weeks out of the month_ thats one way to not get prego_ dont have sex because you are contantly bleeding. I am stopping it now_ I am already bleeding so I may as well let it get out of my system_ and just let my body regulate itself_ at least my head wont be throbbing anymore.,F,32,12  days,11/29/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
645, 3, birth control_ acne,nausea_ headaches for the first few months. none thereafter.,i took ortho for 10 years. then i was diagnosed w/ cervical cancer & had to have part of my cervix removed. my dr said that she has seen this happen in women who take birth control pills long term. read the fine print. don't smoke. go easy on the booze. i have stopped taking the pill since my surgery.,F,28,10  years,11/25/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
646, 3, birth control,I started taking birth control about 15 and I was on estrostep. I think I might go back_ it was a whole lot cheaper. And I have been on this bc for about a year now. The past 3 months I have noticed significant weight gain (almost 20lbs!!!) I havent been doing anything diffferent. I almost ALWAYS get nauseus about 3 days before I start_ and sometimes I do throw up. I have also noticed about 6 months ago a decrease in my sex drive but I thought that was because I was depressed (not sure if it was the pill or not I was in a bad relationship)But I still have weird mood swings_ I dont get mean_ but I get sad for no reason_ not depressed any more though...........not like I was anyways. Should I switch? I'm getting married in March and plan on trying to have a baby in May_ to switch now or to wait......???,,F,20,1  years,11/24/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
647, 5, pregancy prevention,Break through bleeding,I have been on otc lo for almost three months now_ and I know they say that you won't really know for sure how it affects you until after three months_ but I have to say I switched from Yaz to this and it has been amazing yaz made me moody and bitchy for no reason what so ever and taking otc lo also really helped my skin clear up. I finally feel back to my normal self after switching to otc lo! I would highly recommend it to anyone,F,19,3  months,11/22/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen

649, 2, birth control,When I first began taking it I became extremely depressed_ also it made me super emotional which I hated_ as well as making me basically bipolar. My moods were up and down up and down for the first month. After taking it for a couple months I realized my appetite had increased a lot_ which resulted in weight gain.,I really haven't been happy at all about the side affects this pill has had on me_ I'm switching to a different kind.,F,18,5  months,11/17/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
650, 2, pregnancy prevention,weight loss_ very clear skin_ went up a cup size_ no effect on sex drive_ BUT severe depression,At first I was in love with this pill--my skin cleared up instantly and I even lost weight.  However_ I used to be a genuinely happy and easy-going person_ and now I've become so depressed and apathetic about everything and I've recently begun having suicidal ideation. I know is a direct result of this pill--it gets worse each month that I'm on it--and despite all of the positive effects on my body_ it is NOT WORTH IT.,F,19,10  months,11/16/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
651, 2, Hence it's purpose,Hm_ Well after reading the reviews it became even more frustrating for me..because I think any birth control pill at this point sounds pretty much the same. Moodiness_weight gain_headaches_depression_ these are just a few of my least favorite things. I don't know what to resort to. Probably the IUD.  We women put up with a lot of shit_ don't we? Anyways Ortho was awful_ I have enough estrogen_ but now its making me crazy. I have lost my sex drive for the most part_ and my skin has cleared a bit_ but I feel tired and bloated 24/7. not worth it_neither is pregnancy. I will probably resort to the IUD.,,F,24,5  months,11/14/2008Email,Ortho tri-cyclen
652, 3, birth control,very tender breasts_ water retention_ slight nausea,when i went on tri-cyclen lo_ i gained a bit of weight and my boobs grew (they were alread a d cup) and i retained a lot of water. i went on tri-cyclen after my doctor recommended it because she thought perhaps the lower hormone was causing the problems ( i dont understand why a lower hormone would cause more problem but what do i know?) and i continued to gain weight and i was discustingly bloated.. it got to the point where i just felt like a huge fatty and couldnt even sit comfortably in a chair. Some women are totally fine on birth control and some have a horrible time with it and i don't understand why. Everyones body is different and I get that but it would be cool if there was research being done to figure out why it is some women have such a horrible time and others it doesnt effect them at all..,F,20,4  months,11/13/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
653, 4, prevent  pregnancy/ help with per.,swollen and tender boobs_ acne worrsen.,I'm not going to lie after reading the comments i was really scared to start the first pill_ but honestly besides my acne worsening a little and being a little bloated which my doctor said would happen i am very pleased i used to be so craby and have horrible mood swings before_ now there are ten times better. It scares me also reading that people have been gaining weight but i know that im active and will wacth what i eat so i dont have that happen. But if i were you i would take this pill.,F,17,53  days,11/10/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
654, 3, birth control and acne,Break through bleeding - it does help your skin_ but_ the brown bleeding off and on is so irritating.  I switched to another pill and had no interim bleeding_ but_ broke out so I switched back and within two weeks_ brown bleeding again.  Not worth the facial benefits!,,M,38,1  years,11/5/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen

656, 4, birth control_ acne,feeling nauseous sometimes_ little weight gain but not much_ breast tenderness_ headache in the first month,Ive been on Tri Sprintec for 3 months now and cant say that i have had any big trouble with it. My period is always on time and doesnt last more than 5 days. The only thing its kind of working slow on is clearing my acne_ but ive also struggled with that my whole life so i am pretty sure thats going to take a while. All in all its a good form of first birth control. Of course everyone reacts to it differently_ but so far i like it a lot.,F,20,3  months,10/29/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
657, 3, Birth Control,15+ pound weight gain_ EXTREME migraines,I have been on this a year. At first I thought everything was good_ I was actually loosing weight and felt wonderful. Now I have gained over 15lbs and I get severe migraines when it is time to switch pills. The good thing is that my periods are light and now I can track them_ and my skin looks amazing. If you have any info about what I can do about the weight gain and such or questions email me.,F,19,1  years,10/29/2008Email,Ortho tri-cyclen

659, 3, Thats what my doctor prescribed me,I have just recently got a prescription for this birth control_ for my first time ever_ and its been a week now and I feel like crap. The first day of taking it I was nauseated after a long nap of waking up_ and could not keep food on my stomach and then I decided to take it after food other times and let the food settle in my stomch_ but it still at times caused me to feel sick_ yet it did help alot better than taking it without food. My mood swings have been out of this world. But thank God that I have a loving and understanding husband. I have dizziness_ headaches_ and sometimes I even experience vomiting. Also notice fluid retention and its only been a week. A girl at my job told me that it takes a while to get use to it. I havent noticed any real big changes in my skin yet_ maybe it will show up later on. One good thing is my appetite has picked up better_ and I am putting on weight that I did not want to lose before. Hopefully once my first few months of getting use to it_ I will,Overall I recommend any females looking for some form of birth control method to try it and see how it works for them_ because all women are different and could actually have a good experience using this product,F,22,1  weeks,10/27/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
660, 1, prevent pregnancy,Extreme Mood Swings_ dry eyes_ bloat_ crying sprees...yikes!!,I was on OTC-Lo for about 5+ years. Everything was fine_ although I did have some stomach pain and minor weight gain. I went off for about a year and recently started taking OTC-Lo again. It has been a nightmare. I am constantly having mood swings_ and feel depressed_ which is typically not like me at all. I have spent a few days crying my eyes out for what seems no apparent reason at all.  Also_ I have noticed dry eyes_ stomach pain / bloat_ and headaches. I am going to stop after this pack...,F,25, ,10/26/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
661, 1, to avoid pregnancy,headaches_ EXTREME moodiness and heavier periods,I got on this pill after I experienced a very unplanned pregnancy. I miscarried early and did NOT want that to happen again_ so I got on the pill for the first time in my life. I thought things were fine_ but I've started to connect the dots. I have NEVER had headaches in my life and now every couple of days I get them. And my mood swings have been unreal. I have literally become a meaner person. I am so irritable and my sex drive has hit a brick wall. I'm angry for days at a time.But hey..I'm not pregnant.But no. It's not worth it. I'm looking into other options.,F,22,5  months,10/25/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
662, 1, birth control,nausea_ vomiting_ depression_ acne on neck/back,I was on Orth-tri-lo for 4 years and was switched to the regular dosage in order to get the generic brand for less money. I had no problems on the low dosage pill_ however after two months of the regular dosage I am counting down until I can switch back! The first week I had extreme nausea in the mornings and vomited twice (even took a pregnancy test just in case!). These symptoms seem most severe within the first week of each cycle. I also have experienced severe depression and fatigue_ sleeping for 10-11 hours every night. I also cry at the drop of a hat and feel in a down mood for about 2 days out of the week. I've never had severe acne_ but now I've found some on my back and the nape of my neck. The pimples on my face that I occassionally got have multiplied and don't go away. I also never experience cramping_ yet the pill has seemed to make my pms worse_ and has caused me to double over in pain holding my stomach making it difficult to do everyday tasks. I'm switching back to Orth,F,24,2  months,10/22/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
663, 5, prevent pregnancy,none. I recommend taking a Dramamine and peptobismal tablet 30 mins before taking the pill_ and you will be absolutely fine. Also_ take it at night before you sleep.,I was honestly completely freaked out when i read these comments. my doctor put me on o.t.c a month ago but i never actually took it due to all the horrible ratings that some of you gave this pill. Finally_ i talked to some friends who took it and they were astonished that other ppl were having such negative side effects. None of them had noticed any kind of moodiness or depression. Basically_ dont let this site scare you from taking the pill!! There may be side effects for you_ but nearly everything is preventable...take medicine_ it will help!!,F,18,7  days,10/21/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
664, 1, BIRTH CONTROL,constant headaches_ nausea_ hot flashes_ dizziness = not worth it,I have had constant headaches_ which for a long time I couldn't figure out why even though I stopped drinking cappachino.  Over the past 2 months_ I noticed that I was getting hot flashes often which was followed by a slight dizziness and nauseaous feeling.  i know that it sounds a little like premenopuase_ but I'm 29!! All of these symptoms get worse as my period approaches.  I did not have these symptoms before taking this pill.  I called my doctor today to get switched back to Depo.  I hate it!,F,29,6  months,10/20/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
665, 5, Birth Control_ ease of cramps,I haven't experienced anything like moody_ cramps_ or depression yet.  But as of right now_ I am sleeping alot like 9-10 hours which is not normal for me.  I usually get 6-8 hours of sleep and I feel fine.,two of my friends took different BC method one took OTClo--got pregnant and the pills made her sickone took the shot--one shot ($60) every 3 months,F,21,19  days,10/16/2008Email,Ortho tri-cyclen
666, 1, Birth control,Moodiness_ severe anxiety_ weight gain,I had a child in July_ got on the shot immediately after and bled for 3 months_ so I switched to OTC_ since then my bleeding has stopped but I've been gaining weight and the mood swings are horrible. I wake up made at the world everyday and my poor husband seems to get the worse of my mood swings. Im constantly depressed_ it feel like theres no light at the end of this tunnel. I'm switching this week.,F,25,20  days,10/16/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
667, 2, Birth Control,Severe nausea_ yeast infections_ tiredness_ some interference with sleep_ haziness...,I wanted to be safe so that I didn't end up with a baby before I was ready_ but I have been so out of it_ and sooo nauseated_ it's not worth it. I started this pill 7 months ago_ then quit after 3 because the illness wasn't worth it_ and tried it again_ and my nausea has been off the charts_ I even started taking it at night... no help! I thought it was the flu ---and then I remembered that this happens every time!,F,23,7  months,10/13/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
668, 1, prevent pregnancy & stop bad cramps,extremely moody_ depressed_ constantly worrying_ nausea & lightheadedness,The first couple of months taking this pill I should have known it sucked. It made me feel really weird and I was constantly having stomach aches and not feeling good. I assumed it was because I had just switched brands and my body needed time to adjust. Well it's been almost a year now and nothing has gotten better. I am extremely moody and can get sad/depressed/cry/angry for no reason at all. Every month when I start the first pill of a new pack_ I get really sick_ nautious_ light headed_ and I miss class/work because of this. It was a huge mistake ever getting on this pill_ and within the next month I am either switching or stopping the pill completely. This pill has also majorly decreased my sex drive_ which was never the case before.,F,21,10  months,10/13/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen

Also loss of sex drive and ability to orgasm.,Was on OTC (and generic) for 10 yrs w/o any known problems.  Suddenly pill began causing abdominal pain.  Went off (against Dr's advice)_ and felt much better.  Sex improved which I did not even realize was due to pill.,F,33,10  years,10/11/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen

I was taking both OTC Lo and TriNessa. I absolutely love these pills! I got off the pill in April and I actually gainied weight and became a total psycho! This week I started the OTC Lo again and i'm looking forward to the days that come! Ladies... don't be scared! The pill isn't a life long commitment! If you try it out and it doesn't work for you then don't continue using it! Just switch to another until you find the right one. You will not know what works best with your body by reading comments!,F,22,3  years,10/10/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
671, 3, Birth Control,SEVERE mood swings that got progressively worse with each month. I've been taking it for 6 months and it's not bearable anymore. I had to stop taking it. My mood swings are definitely caused by the drug. Before taking them I was a pretty stable person. After taking it_ I can feel my head fog up and I start to take offense to anything and everything. I feel depression and it takes away my motivation to do things that I enjoy. This only happens a few days before I start my period and a few days after. Most severe is the day I start. My thoughts are clear. I can think that I have no reason to be crying - but I just feel so down_ I don't want to bother to stop crying. ,I do not recommend this drug if you want to avoid mood swings.,F,21,6  months,10/9/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
672, 3, Birth control and acne,Morning nausea 1st week of new pack of pills; feeling of fuzzy-headedness_ inability to focus; 2 days/month totally crazy and depressed_ sometimes in a rage. Lost 8 pounds when I discontinued it so I suppose it contributed to some weight gain.,Cleared up my skin_ worked great for that. Also no babies_ so worked there_ too. But the depression_ irritability_ moodiness and overall gloomy mood 2-3 days/month made it not worth it.,F,29,5  years,10/9/2008Email,Ortho tri-cyclen
673, 1, Prevent Pregnancy_ Acne,Gained weight_ irritable_ tired_ angry_ loss of sensitivity_ dryness_ makes me hate the way my body looks,I was on otc and otc lo for 9 years and decided to give my body a break for a year. During that year I felt great- My body responded to excercise and my periods were worse_ but they were still like clockwork. I just got back on OTC lo a month ago after trying Yaz first (bigger mistake) I feel like I am so mad at myselft all the time because I am constantly putitng on more weight- so far 7 lbs in a month. I work out all the time and my eating habits haven't changed. I have a very healthy lo cal diet. I snap and get pissed off so easy now and I a m tired all the time. I feel so bloated.

I had taken this pill in the past. I loved it. Regulated my periods_ lost weight_ and no change in my sex drive. I switched to Yaz to try something new and gained 30 pounds in just over 2 months. As soon as I stopped taking Yaz I began to lose weight. And now I'm back on Ortho lo and loving it.,F,29,3  years,10/8/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen

I have been on it for the three months_ and I have had tons of negative side effects that make me question whether or not it works at all. At the beginning_ I was dizzy_ sick_ and vomiting constantly. After the first month_ this mostly went away_ but was still randomly present. I gained about 10 pounds from the time I started to now_ and my breasts increased by at least a cup size_ maybe more. I have been randomly bursting into tears for no reason at all_ have been depressed almost constantly_ and at the third week of this pack_ I have begun menstruating_ rather that the fourth week. I have also developed acne_ and before I have never had any problems with breakouts in my life. Now_ my face is simply covered with zits and blemishes.

678, 2, Birth control and less cramps,Headaches_ mood swings_ no sex drive_ depressed!,I have grown to hate these pills.  I had terrible mood swings while taking them.  The only time I was close to being myself was the week I had my period b/c I wasn't taking the normal pills.  I was on and off depressed_ I had ZERO desire to have sex_ and was angry more then I was happy.  It was also terribly frustrating when I was exercising 5 days a week and not loosing a SINGLE POUND! Lost the desire to work out...did me no good.  Switching to another pill as soon as possible.,F,22,1.5  years,10/5/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
679, 5, Period Regulation,After three months my period was great!  I was regular finally!  I never gained any weight_ I heard that birth control doesn't do that to you.  When I switched to Tri Nessa I did't see a huge change.  I switched after 8yrs being on Tri Cyclen to Tri nessa.  Maybe my mood (cranky)  nothing severe or abnormal.  I recommend either birth control,,F,26,12  years,10/4/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen

682, 1, birth control,I ahve only been taking it one month and i have already noticed some changes. I am extreamly moody and seem to come off as bitchy. I find myself crying more too. This pill has already made me gain weight. I havent taken it long enough to regulate my period. With all the migranes_ depressed feelings_ and the weight gain I have stopped taking this pill.,,F,20,28  days,10/2/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
683, 5, birth control,Slight weight gain (5-7 lbs.)_ fuller hair_ better skin_ increased breast size_ somewhat irregular periods,I LOVED this pill. Couldn't recommend it more. All of my side effects were great. I never had acne or skin problems but this pill even got rid of the occasional blemish. My only complaint would be that it was very difficult to get a stable period. Even while taking the placebo pills_ my period wouldn't come right away and after being off of birth control pills for nearly 2 years_ my period still has not regulated since. However_ i'm going back on it this month!,F,21,1  years,9/25/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
684, 2, Prevent Pregnancy,Weight gain_ moodiness_ depression_ low libido,I have been taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen for 2 years now and it is horrible.  I have never been this upset or depressed.  Anything my husband can say will make me cry for hours.  I hate having sex now and that is definitely not normal for me.  Before starting this awful medicine_ I had a very high libido and a high self-esteem.  Everything changed once I started this birth control.  I cannot wait to go to the doctor to change to something else.,F,21,2  years,9/25/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
685, 1, Birth Control,weight gain_ vaginal dryness_ MAJOR yeast infections and skin sensitivities_ bloating,Simply put_ I felt horrible.  I had switched to it since I was missing my period often while on Loestrin 24 Fe and I felt uncomfortable.  My doctor suggested Ortho tri-Cycen Lo since it was known for regulazing periods.  HORRIBLE!  It regulated me and basically dried out my vaginal skin.  I had an ongoing on and off yeast infection for the two months I tried it.  My sexual drive was the same_ but I was always in pain and irritated.  I was bloated and gained weight (very little) but the bloating made me look huge.  I was irritated and my skin broke out.  I had rashes and hives (granted it was summer)_ and overall unpleasant health.  It did NOT suit me well at all_ and I took it the way it said to take it.,F,29,2  months,9/23/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
686, 1, prevent pregnancy,Headaches_ dizziness_ mood swings_ extreme irritability and sensitivity_ breast tenderness and swelling_loss of sex drive_ hair loss_  and the only positive side effect: smooth_ clear skin.,My periods were very irregular when I was on microgestin for 6 months so I went on ortho tri-cyclen to try to regulate them. My skin cleared up_ but beyond that I had a horrible experience with this pill. I was a different person while taking it.I felt unusually irritable and sensitive. I cried for no reason. I felt depressed.  I had almost no desire for sex. I stayed on it for two months_ hoping the side effects would diminish_ but they didn't. I also noticed that my hair was falling out at a faster rate than normal. I decided my mental health was more important than predictable periods_ so I stopped taking this pill.,F,24,2  months,9/22/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
687, 3, period regulation,weight gain_ water weight_ severe bloating_ didn't do much with my acne_ brownish/ blackish discharge_ depression due to weight gain_ night sweats,I've been taking ortho tri-cyclen lo for a few years now and in the beginning it was going really well. Or maybe I thought it was going well. I didn't realize that some of the things that were happening to me were not normal so I didn't really realize until I read this site that these are things that were caused by my birth control. I have made an appointment with my doctor and plan on trying new birth control as soon as I can. One thing I must say about the weight gain thing is I am not a big person_ I happen to be pretty skinny_ and there was one day that physically I could not fit into my jeans. It was just the one day.

688, 1, I took TRINESSA as Birth Control,HEAVY AND IMMEDIATE WEIGHT GAIN_ ACNE ESPECIALLY AROUND MY JAW_ DEPRESSION_ DIFFICULTY BREATHING_ LACK OF MOTIVATION_ MIGRAINES.,I cannot believe all of these comments_ because I had the same exact reaction to TRINESSA_ and thought it was my own fault for gaining 8 pounds in a WEEK. I am normally in very good shape and stay very active_ but last week_ when I went on Trinessa_ everything changed immediately: i put on weight right away_ was starving and wanted to eat everything in sight.  At night_ I felt like I could not breathe AT ALL_ and I smoke once in a while_ so I was convinced that my lungs were finally in trouble!  I am about 5 foot 7.5_ and I weighed myself a week ago_ 127 lbs_ which is standard for me.  I weighed myself yesterday_ because I just felt so much additional weight on my body_ indeed: 135.  i have stopped taking this HORRIBLE BIRTH CONTROL_ and now hope that I will soon lose the weight_ the pain_ and the acne.,F,,7  days,9/21/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
689, 1, Birth Control_ Regulate Periods_,HORRIBLE mood swings_ cramping_ clotting_ and weight gain!  I could not imagine why I was always in such a wicked mood.  Mad at everyone & everything_ not thinking at all that it was related to the Ortho.  I gained 5 pounds of water weight which made me bloated & uncomfortable all the time.  One week of every month_ I felt great...the rest of the month I felt horrible.,I wish I hadn't wasted the 2 years or more that I was on it...and wish I had seen this website earlier or I would have told my Dr. to give me something else.  I have switched to YAZ effective July 08_ and it is AWESOME!  Highly recommend!  Lost the weight_ no bloating_ no cramps_ lighter period_ and more important...none of those damn mood swings!,F,37,2  years,9/12/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
690, 1, birth control,very decreased sex drive_ moody bitch (especially with pms) weight gain,I was also on the generic versions (both tri nessa & tri sprintec) and they were both horrible. The changes happened slowly for me and I thought there was something wrong with me rather than the pills. I finally talked to my doctor and she started me on loestrin 24fe (took the first pill today) so I'm hopeful again!,F,33,3  years,9/10/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen

693, 5, Been switched to TriNessa,None so far. I don't understand all the negative comments about TriNessa. It is made of the exact same dosage of norgestimate and ethinyl estradial as Orth tri lo. Exact!! I don't think some people can handle birth control if it makes you have that many problems!?!?!? Severe mood swings?? I have tried 4 different types of birth control and never had crazy side effects from any of them!!!,,F,34,7  days,9/6/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
694, 1, birth control,Acne! Mainly around my  mouth - constantly broke out!_ Weight gain!_ Yeast Infection_ irregular periods_ spotting.,I hated this medication. I broke out constantly - and I rarely had acne problems before. I gained 5 pounds in 2 months which is also really weird for me because I tend to maintain my weight rather well - no eating habits changed or workout changes - I just gained 5 pounds for no reason. I also had a ton of spotting - which made me super paranoid. It also gave me a really bad yeast infection. This medication sucks.,F,21,2  months,9/3/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
695, 1, Regulate periods,Constant breast pain (non-cyclic)_ sometimes in both breasts_ more often than not in just one. Possible weight gain. Increased vascularity in chest/breasts.,I have never taken the non-generic version of this BC. I was switched to Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo after Ovcon 35 was no longer available. This is approximately 2 years ago. Has anyone else experienced moderate to severe breast pain from this product? Or noticeably darker veins in the chest and breast area? I'm trying to narrow down possible reasons for my breast pain (which_ ironically_ started not long after starting this pill). It seems a coincidence that my breast pain and weight gain escalated after taking this pill...especially after finding this site. I realize this could be because I am now in my 30's (I have been on birth control since age 14 with none of these side effects) but part of me suspects this particular pill.,F,33,3  years,8/26/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen

The only side effect was temporary nausea 3 - 5 hours after taking the pill. But after about 7 weeks_ I noticed I was always dry down there_ and my sex drive and ability to orgasm was diminishing. The nausea became more spread out. Then_ I notied that after taking the pill every night_ my anxiety was through the roof. I could not calm down_ no matter what. I would try to sleep and I would just lay there all night. My heart pounded. I was not taking anything else_ not even caffeine. I would finally fall asleep around 7:30 am_ and find that I could just sleep all day if I would let myself. (I recalled having similar unexplained daytime drowsiness back when I had been on Yasmin_ and now I attribute it to that) Through all this_ I still wanted to tough it out and go past the 3rd pack like the directions say your body will get used to it_ but here's the reason I stopped: I used to have OCD so severe that it interfered with my living a normal life.

I have mild headaches toward the end of my pack and my appetite in the morning has slightly increased_ but that's it.,I adore Trinessa_ seriously. I've read a lot of negative things about it_ but it's been nothing but a dream for me. I was on Yasmin_ Junel FE_ and Microgestin FE before this. Yasmin was acceptable_ but I was moody. Junel and Microgestin turned me into a needy_ neurotic bitch. TRINESSA has regulated my periods so that I can predict them to the day_ evened out my moodswings_ gotten rid of most of my cramps_ and kept my libido at normal levels (I'm naturally very high libido and it hasn't changed).

Since then_ I've been given Trinissa and Tri Sprintec as generics for OTC and have had many negative side effects. I am currently having major bad side effects with Loestrin. Each person is different and will react to each medication differently. You are bound to find one that works for you_ give it 3-6 months and try another.

708, 3, severe cramping_ heavy flow,I gained 10 pounds within the first month of taking this pill.  My cramps have lessened somewhat_ and my flow has been greatly reduced.  The cramps still require excessive quantities of pain killers_ and I start to feel them coming on the Monday after I go off the pills even though my actual flow doesn't start until Tuesday or Wednesday.  So_ that is a bit bothersome.   Also_ this pill caused my flow to have fairly large clots_ which I never experienced before and contributes to the painful cramping.  On the upside_ it has drastically shortened the actual days of flow to about three_ which is the best thing I can say about this pill.  I have also experienced increasing anxiety and mood swings.  While you can never really be sure if that's directly related to the pill_ it does seem to have intensified since I started taking this pill.,I started on birth control when I was 16.  I'm now 36.  I started on Demulen 1/50_ 50 mcg of estrogen.  Talk about harsh on a 16 year old.  I've been on Ortho cept and Ortho Cyclen since then_ never being really satisfied with any of them.    I started OTC after reading some decent things about it online.First off_ I gained 10 pounds in the first month of taking it_ mostly in the boobs it seemed.  I went up almost a full cup size.  My husband was pleased with this.  Me_ not soo much.  Secondly_ it did reduce the flow amount and length greatly.  3 day periods_ and I basically only use Lite tampons.  That's the best benefit this pill had.  Thirdly_ it caused pretty extreme clotting in my flow_ which makes the cramping worse.  Lastly_ I have experienced increasing anxiety_ depression_ and mood swings with it_ unlike anything I experienced with the other pills I've been on.  Bottom line_ you will most likely gain weight on this pill and experience some negative mood altering effect,F,36,2  years,6/23/2008Email,Ortho tri-cyclen

I recently went back on it about 6 months ago and it turned me into a crazy nutcase. I was constantly crying for no reason. I had anxiety daily and also felt quite depressed. The good side to it was it did clear up my acne. There were no other real side effects besides that but I decided to get off it because of the way it made me feel and within weeks I felt so much better.

I gained about 10 lbs and had 2 periods a month.  After 4 months_ they switched me to OTC regular and lost 10 lbs quickly.  I seem to be more regular but have had some naseau in mornings and sometimes become very moody and rude my husband says for no apparent reason.  I feel almost pre-menopausal and have an anal itch that has started.  I also feel it makes my stomach more acidic and gasy if such a word and have had 2 painful stomach aches with lightheadedness and cold sweats in last 4 months and ate nothing out of the ordinary.,OTC regular seems to be keeping me regular and have not experienced any hair loss. I am just trying to figure out if all my side effects are normal or am I having pre-menopausal experiences at 37 years of age.  I have a history in my family on my mom's side of early menopause before 40. Ugh!

I was able to control the irritability but the weight was still there.  As soon as I got off this pill_ I felt like a new person and lost the 10lbs within two weeks.  I'm taking Microgestin (generic LoEstrin) now and unhappy with it too.  No weight gain_ light periods but suffered from cramps and SEVERE mood swings.  SEVERE.

I've tried one other birth control.

Periods are simple to plan for.,I know that some people experience bad side effects on this_ but I have been on Ortho Tri-cyclen for a year and a month now and it's worked great for me. My periods are much shorter and lighter and my skin is clearer. I have not experienced sexual problems (dryness_ decreased libido_ &c.) but I know other women who basically had no sex drive on this medication. Even after they were not taking it_ however_ it did not return so I'm not sure how much of it had to do with the medication. I recommend it_ but like any other drug_ it might effect you differently. I never had cramps before I took the pill and I still don't have them. And like anyone will tell you eating right and being physically active will improve your life and your mood whether or not you're on any medication.

I will say that usually a week before I start my cycle I start cramping.  I have noticed that the more ""severe"" they are that week the less likely I will have cramps during my period.  The less ""severe"" they are the more likely it is that I will have cramps during my period.  It is kind of nice to know ahead of time what to expect.",I absolutely LOVE Orth Tri-Cyclen.  I as well have naturally clear skin_ but every once in a while I might have the occasional zit.  Nothing major and I would even venture to say that I go 9-10 months a year without a zit.  I would NOT recommend taking Orth Tri-Cyclen LO.  I have a friend who took it and she did end up pregnant while taking the pill religiously.  My husband also has worked and currently does work with women who take it and they have all ended up pregnant on it as well.

I'm basically looking for a birth control that doesn't cause acne. And if it does_ it will go away after a few months.

I NEVER had bad acne but after 3 days of being on this pill my face looks horrible.  My BF has no idea what to do because I am an emotional wreck for the smallest most insignificant reasons.  It is very hard for me to be in a good mood for some reason. Everything makes me either cry or very angry. My thoughts seems to be constantly racing as well. I am also bleeding but I kind of expected that since my hormone levels changed...after reading other comments I'm just hoping it stops and i stop feeling like a total psycho!,F,22,7  days,3/31/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen

I thought I was going crazy. I have been on OTC since 1999. I started on it when I still a teen to regulate my period_ then it had the added benefit of being a contraceptive when my boyfriend and I became sexually active. I had always been chubby growing up and so I dismissed the weight gain until recently as just losing the battle of the bulge. Even with diet changes and exercise I still seem to be putting on pounds not losing them. I have also am have noticed myself becoming increasing depressed_ moody (which my boyfriend was quick to point out). I had to stop wearing my contacts as soon as I started the pill. I kept blinking them out of my eyes. I had no idea this was a serious side effect and will be speaking with my doctor. The tenderness in my breasts is also quite severe. I cannot wear any bras with seams down the cups or any kind of lace because it irritates my nipples so much. The migranes have started in the last few years.

Before I started Trinessa_ I read A LOT of bad things about it_ but you've got to remember that people are more likely to post about bad experiences than good ones_ so just remember for every negative review there's just as many if not more good ones.

Over the last 3 years I have been having bad breakouts around my chin. I tried everything from ProActiv to store bought products and nothing worked. I didn't really think anything of it because if I did breakout I would clear up in a short while.  Over the last 6 months I have not cleared and my acne breakouts are getting worse. It's weird because I haven't had acne until I started on Ortho Tri-cyclen.  The acne breakouts are only on the right side of my chin.  I saw that a couple of people had the same acne break outs on their chin.

It's effective at preventing pregnancy_ my skin is clear_ yes my weight has been up and down within 10-15 lbs_ but with diet and exercise I can keep it at 105 lbs.

Trinessa is a generic of regular OTC (which has 35mcg of estrogen).  If you were happy with OTC-lo (25 mcg estrogen) your doctor shouldn't have put you on a higher dose of estrogen with the generic Trinessa.  This is probably why you're having problems.

I've been taking it for about two years and although i don't remember to take it every day or at the same time_ still works great.  wish the period was a little shorter but its' not bad because it's lighter and the cramp are almst non existent.

I was taking ortho tri-clen LO for 4 months and although it regulated my period it definately made me gain weight and altered my mood. Although with the weight gain my boobs got bigger_ I didn't enjoy the layer of fat that seemed to form all around me_ especially on my stomach.  I used to have a little 4 pack on my belly_ now its completely gone and I truely haven't changed my eating/exercise habits. Weight gain wasn't the main reason I stopped taking it though_ it was the MOOD SWINGS. I'm known for being happy and giggly person and this birth control made me feel like I was going crazy. Every month around the 10th pill i'd have unexplained uncontrollable crying.  It got to the point that I would want to not go to work because I was so emotional or just go to sleep so I'd stop crying.

780, 1, lighter periods & prevent pregnancy,i've been on tri-nessa [generic for ortho-tri-cyclen] almost a year. anyway_ my bf's parents said i dont want you to date someone who isn't on birth control. so my mom put me on it..i've been through MORE hell with this pill than i ever have with my life. i have terrible headaches_ i get cramps [non-menstural cramps]so bad i cant walk or move_ and i wont even mention the mood swings i have_ and the day after i start a new pack_ i'm in the bathroom throwing up 3 morinings in a row! imagine telling that to your boyfriend! the only advantage i found about it was i'm now 109 pounds and when i first started taking it was 92 pounds. i have trouble gaining weight_ so the pill did help me not look like a toothpick,if you have the option of taking something else_ do it!,F,15,1  years,1/20/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
781, 1, Hate it!,EXTREME mood swings_ crying_ continuous spotting,I started taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen low and stayed on it for about a month and a half.  I  know they say you need to stay on it for a pretty good while for symptoms to level out but i was ABSOLUTELY NOT going to any longer because of horrible_ horrible mood swings and spotting.  I cried non stop it seemed.  I would cry over the most ridiculous things and even hyperventilated during these crying fits.  I stayed bloated and irritable.  I also had continuous spotting throughout the entire time i took this med.  This is supposed to prevent pregnancy.  I can see how it prevents it if you are bleeding constantly your partner wants to stay abstinent!!!  I was so disappointed.,F,25,45  days,1/19/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen
782, 1, prevent pregnancy/ regulate periods,bloating_nausia_ mood swings_ emotional wreck_,Ortho-tri-cyclen is a horrible pill. I ive seen comments where some girls are saying that people are complaining and stuff but they just dont know what we're going through. About the first 3 months_ I had severe nausia every night_ then after 6 months of taking it_ I had a 14 day period. Then had nausia random nights. Ive actaully lost weight too_ during the past few months I have been emotional to the extreme and crying non stop. Ive noticed I sometimes get upset with my boyfriend for no reason. Thankfully he hasnt noticed but all of these things are not like me. Im usually such a happy_ cheerful person and now Im emotional and really moody. Im relieved that so many other people have experienced this also. I plan to stop taking the pill this weekend and stick to using condoms. so anyone trying to decide if they should take it_.. DON'T. It may work for a few people_ but for others_ its horrible_ and now people have to stop taking it just to be themselves again.,F,19,8  months,1/16/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen

789, 4, Regular my menstrual cycle,I actually lost a bit of weight after being on OTClo for a year. probabbly around 10-15 lbs. I did however experience mood swings and fatigue but nothing major--just the normal side effects of any hormome pill you put in your body.,My father has now re-enlisted in the army--so my insurance has been switched. They sent me trinessa and I'm almost a week into my first pack. I have horrible nausea. I have been very sick to my stomach all week and diahrea has been horrible as well. I was going to just try to let my body get used to the new pills but I think after this month I'm just going to pay the extra and get back on OTClo. I had to leave class today due to not being able to sit for 10 minutes without either throwing up or having to go to the bathroom. This is a nightmare!,F,18,18  months,1/4/2008,Ortho tri-cyclen

I am VERY athletic and was skinny and muscular before I started this pill and about almost a month after I started gaining weight. It wasn't that much but as I kept taking it more weight is gradually going on. I also get terrible migrains with this pill. It makes me moody with MAJOR mood swings towards my bf and family and friends. One minute ill be laughing then the next crying over nothing. This pill is nothing but trouble. I have to stay on it though for my blod clauting issue but if anyone knows a good birth control without these AWFUL weight gain side effects and other minimul side affects that would be great. Jut post someting. DON'T TAKE THIS PILL_ IT CAUSES PROBLEMS!!!,Made me gain weight_ retain water weight_ migrains_ mood swings. AWFUL PILL!,F,16,3  months,12/14/2007Email,Ortho tri-cyclen

792, 5, Birth Control,I started taking Ortho Tri-Cylen when I was 19 and switched brands to save money.  I don't remember experiencing any side effects besides losing a bunch of weight right when I started.,I switched to Trinessa as the first generic and didn't experience any really noticable side effects other than mood swings and some sadness.  Then that got recalled! I am taking Tri-Sprintec now and I am experiencing such depression and mood swings that it drove me to look up the side effects online. Sure enough I found this website. I have headaches during my period_ hair loss_ depression_ mood swings_ fatigue and nausea sometimes with my first pill of the month. I have been on this for a couple of years now_ but I'm just starting to notice these side effects are affecting my life.  I found a great website that compares levels and dosages of common birth control brands http://www.wdxcyber.com/ncontr13.htm. This proves that the generic is not exactly the same as the name brand with a different name...but that each brand contains different potency of hormones and that could be affecting some people_ but not others.

793, 4, Birth control_ period regulation,I've been taking ortho tri-cyclen lo for almost a year now. I haven't experienced too many side effects except for occasional nausea and headaches but these only occured when I was starting a new pack each month. Sometimes I do think I've gotten anxiety from taking the pills (this was a mentioned side-effect): sometimes I do feel a little crazy and get moody_ but it passes. I'm not sure if it's the pills or if it's just me. I have not experienced any weight gain_ or any more acne. In fact_ I think it's pretty much cleared up my acne. I can say_ though_ that it hasn't helped with making my period any lighter; my periods are still heavy and I still get bad cramps_ though not as debilitating as they were before I started taking the pill.,I've heard some horror stories about other pills but I'd reccomend this to  anyone really.,F,19,9  months,12/6/2007,Ortho tri-cyclen
794, 4, birth control_ regular periods,some vaginal dryness_ more yeast infections_ breast tenderness in first couple of months_ moodiness (extreme depression),I took the lo version of this- the side effects were really pretty manageable- I didn't really have any problems with it other than the depression-especially during the 3rd week of pills.  That week was always a nonstop cry-fest!,F,28,1  years,12/2/2007,Ortho tri-cyclen

I recently switched to Tri Sprintec: Water rentention_ weight gain_ return of acne,I switched to Tri Sprintec about 2 months ago to save money_ and I've noticed a weight gain of about 8 lbs -- nothing has changed with my diet or exercise_ if anything I'm more active now than I was before. Also_ the water retention is crazy! I bloat up and my fingers swell_ I just feel gross. Also_ my skin is starting to break out.  I'm switching back to Ortho ASAP -- it's worth the extra money to me!,F,24,4  years,12/2/2007,Ortho tri-cyclen
796, 2, Birth Control,Loss of sex drive_ anxiety_ extreme mood swings and weight gain.,Since I started taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo_ my sex drive has gone from very active to zero.  Every little thing starts an argument between my husband and I.  I have noticed I am emotionally beating myself up.  I am now constantly anxious about everything where before I had a significantly lower level of anxiety.  I also gained 30 pounds within 2 months.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.,F,25,10  months,12/1/2007,Ortho tri-cyclen
797, 3, Clear up acne,None yet.  Last night was day one of the pill...,I have had relatively clear skin for most of my life_ with occasional flare ups that always went away with derm treatment.  This past few months_ after a period of several years of clear skin_ my skin just went out of control.  I tried everything from oral antibiotics_ topical medication_ even laser therapy.  It would clear up then come back just before my period.  I've been pretty sure that it is hormone induced_ so I decided to try Ortho Tricyclin.  I've always been wary of the pill because when I tried it years ago I had all the major side effects.  I went on depo twice_ the first time was ok_ but the second time it made me break out.  I'm hoping my body will do well on OTC_ but we'll see.  Thanks to everyone for your posts.  I would have taken the generics if not for all your advice.  Ok_ so_ day one and I have moderate acne_ have all my hair and weigh about 112 lbs.  Let's see what happens...,F,34,1  days,11/28/2007Email,Ortho tri-cyclen

I thought it was too much sun-exposure on vacation_ but now I realize it's the pill.   I am also having severe cramping after only 10 days.  My mouth is really dry and I'm tired.  I'm also starting to feel nauseated and can't eat today.  It's so strange.  I recently lost about 20 lbs and my energy level has been super high. BUT Today was the first day in months that I've felt sleepy and a lack motivation.  I haven't had any bad moodswings yet_ but it sounds like I shoudl brace myself!  I have 3 weeks left of this pack.  I think I will be hrowing the pack away.   I was better off not taking any pills,I don't think this is a good product.  I hear great things about the BRAND name...so just insist that your pharmacist give you the BRAND name.,F,27,10  days,11/28/2007,Ortho tri-cyclen

I have taken Ortho Tri-Cyclen before and had no trouble.  In fact_ I became a much nicer person.  On Tri-Prefivem_ I must be allergic to the fillers (inactive ing.) or something_ because my experience has been horrible.  I am currently trying Tri Sprintec_ hoping it will work out better.  Tri-Prefivem has caused not only physical problems_ but irreparable damage to my relationship with my husband.  In fact_ we filed for divorce due to the mood swings. It was only until later_ I discovered it was a result of my hormones and the effects of the med.,F,25,1  years,11/27/2007,Ortho tri-cyclen

When I switched to Tri-Prefivem_ I had horrible side effects.  So much in fact_ that I am unable to take birth control at all now.  It has thickened my blood and lead to blood clots_ so add Lovenox injections twice a day and Cumadin to thin my blood to my daily regimen.

Trinessa has made my skin look beautiful and my mood has been great!  Just a word of advice to anyone thinking about OTC or OTC generic - everyone reacts differently to birth control!  It took me 3 tries to find one I liked so don't give up.

808, 4, prevent pregnancy/acne,I started taking Ortho tri as a teenager to help clear up my acne_ but it took me a long time to get used to it_ was having a lot of nausea etc so I stopped for several months. Went back on and felt okay after a while. Then stopped taking any pills for about 6months  and lost quite a bit of weight. Got a new prescription for Ortho-lo which didn't work at all for me as I was having my period every 2 weeks and a lot of breakthru bleeding. I lost my insurance so Planned Parenthood gave me Ortho Tri for a while and then I was later switched to Trinessa. I've taken BC on and off for approx. 8yrs and have never had the side effects I've had with this generic. I've been on it about a year now- It has totally trashed my sex drive_ has made me have total insomnia which is driving me crazy and I've been recently getting migranes!

810, 3, decided to switch from alesse,I started taking tri cyclen after having an abortion and at first the effects were terrible. I was over emotional to the extreme and my periods were lasting two weeks at a time. I thought it was probably because I just had the abortion and it was true. Eventually_ my period went back to a normal routine_ it comes every month at the expected time and only lasts a couple of days. It does its job well at preventing pregnancy in my opinion since I have been on it for 8 months. However_ I did experience weight gain mainly in the bum and thighs and the worst side effect by far has been the verry low sex drive and crying fits. I never used to get so emotional all the time... its really irritating. I used to be on Alesse and I didnt take it properly so I got pregnant. (my fault) But until then_ I felt ok. Anyone else had that experience? I feel like the varying doses keeps me in different moods all month and I feel at my best on the week off... while im on my period.

Also_ in the first 1-4 days of the pack of the white pills_ I have nausea and now vomited just once. The biggest problem with this is that it makes me nauseas. It works for now(knock on wood). My periods are VERY light_ they are on time_ and practically NO cramping at all_ which is amazing!

(by the way_ I tried Trinessa for less than a month when it first came out - it was HORRIBLE_ I had crying spells for no reason_ made me depressed and anxious_ so I switched back to the brand name stuff).,Over the course of 8 years_ my libido has significantly decreased. I realized that the birth control pills were the culprit when I stopped using it for a couple of months (due to insurance coverage problems) and my libido increased. Then I went back on the OTC and my libido went south again. My gynecologist prescribed OTC-Lo last week so we'll see how that goes. I hope it helps with my libido or else I may get an IUD.,F,29,8  years,10/1/2007,Ortho tri-cyclen

I've never really had an acne problem_ but I no acne at all with TriNessa.NEGATIVE: I've never really been moody_ but after taking TriNessa_ I definitely felt grumpier right before my period (maybe now I'm just experiencing PMS like everyone else does_ and I never know what I was ""missing out"" on before)_ tender breasts right before period.MISC: My breasts grew a cup size_ which I really didn't care about_ but my boyfriend appreciated. I've heard a lot of people complaining about loss of libido and weight gain_ but neither one of these seem to be an issue for me.

Yes_ it did prevent pregnancy_ but it did nothing to regulate or shorten my unusually heavy/long periods (which last about 10 days_ on average). It made my PMS symptoms and cramps worse. Also_ I gained 20 lbs from it almost instantly (I KNOW it was Ortho_ because I did not do anything to change my level of physical activity_ and my eating habits remained healthy...).

After this switch set off adult acne (I had never had skin problems before)_ weight gain and awful mood swings_ I consulted my insurer and my doctor.  THERE IS NO TRUE GENERIC FOR ORTHO.  Google it_ you'll see each and every birth control bill contains a very different amount of hormones.  Find the one that works for you and stick with it_ regardless what the pharmacy says.,,F,32,10  years,9/27/2007,Ortho tri-cyclen

I have yet to find a birth control pill that didn't cause periods that last two weeks for at least part of the time that I was on it. Trinessa seemed to be working just fine for me_ after about a three month adjustment period (during which time I experienced major irritability_ breakthrough bleeding and increased breast size). I am approximately 8 or 9 months into taking it now and I have been experiencing increasingly worse acne every month_ in addition to weight gain. The two-week periods went away for about 3 months in the middle of my taking it_ but they're back now...and I'm ready to switch. AGAIN.

But after the birth of my son 2 years ago_ I was prescribed OTC. Can't say whether I would've had a better experience with OTC but I can say that Trinessa has been a nightmare. My husband says that I am a totally different person and I do feel different. I'm moody_ irritable_ short-fused_ and impatient. My face hasn't broken out like this since I was a teenager. I'm nauseous the first 2 days back on it and the fatigue is miserable. My hair comes out in handfuls in the shower. And sex is out of the question. I just went to my dr. this week and requested a new bcp and hopefully will have better results.

Recently_ my doctor prescribed OTL-low and now I noticed I gained even more weight (almost 5lbs). I have been exercising regularly and eating better so the only thing i could think of is the switch to OTC. Is this normal?

My mood is much better on this pill and my skin is PERFECT.,I have to say this website SCARED THE CRAP OUT OF ME 6 months ago when I received my first prescription for OTC and got delivered a generic.  Luckily_ I gave Tri-previfem a try instead of insisting on brand name and I'm very glad I stuck with it.  Before being on this pill_ I would get very severe migraines every few months and these seem to have become less frequent.

Then my symptoms would go away_ I'd be normal...just for them to come back again the following month.  I felt like I was nuts.  My doc put me on Orth Tri-cyclen_ and within the first month_ I was back to my normal self ALL the time_ even the week before my period.  I refused to take the generic kind_ however_ I'm too paranoid about the RECALL of Trinessa last year.

865, 5, PMDD and acne,I was on antidepressants to control PMDD and antibiotics for the acne and neither was working very well. The Antidepressants made me too unemotional about everything-very flatlined. So I asked if we could try hormone treatment. The Trinessa was great. Everything seemd to be gong fine until for some reason the Pharmacist switched it to Sprintec. He said they were the same thing.  For 5 months I have thought I was going crazy. The mmods swings were awful and got worse. the acned are around my chin and neck came back and never went away. The next time I went for a refill I asked a different pharmacist and he said they were NOT the same thing. Thank God--I thought I was going crazy. So now I am back on the Trinessa-first week. and I feel better already. Although I have had a hard time sleeping the last couple of night.  No one else has mentioned that so it must be stress or something else.,,F,42, ,7/8/2007,Ortho tri-cyclen

As an adult_ I was on OTC for a long time before being switched to Trinessa about a year ago due to insurance reasons.  The OTC worked great for me.   The Trinessa_ on the other hand_ has been terrible.    I never know what I'm going to get from month to month.  Some months are fine_ with a little water weight gain like clockwork about 10 days prior to menstruating  Some months_ however_ are OUT OF CONTROL.   Headaches that won't go away or intense fatigue...having to sleep and sleep and sleep_ or no desire to go anywhere or do anything or see/talk to anyone.   This month I had breast enlargement from almost the very first pill and have subsequently gained about 10 pounds in two weeks.   This is unheard of as I work out *daily* and watch what I eat.   It simply feels like the hormones in Trinessa are off_ from month to month.   With their recall last year_ they certainly don't seem very reliable.

Until I read some of the other comments.  I thought it was just me.  I even went to see specialists about that because my husband was getting frustrated with me.  I also thought my water retention problem would eventually go away with retention pills.  Nope.  I've been taking water retention pills every day for 2 months and still only have normal feet and ankles on the last 2 days of my period.  As soon as I take my birth control pills again_ wammo.  I balloon out all over again.  I never had an acne problem either before.  Now I can't get it under control.  I was on Alesse before and the only reason I switched was because the suppliers were having shortage problems.  Too much demand.  The pharmacy gave me Tri-Cyclen Lo since it was similar in dosage to Alesse.  I decided to just stay on them.  Big mistake.  Switching back asap.

I would get pissed off at people for no reason and make the biggest deal over the littlest things.  I can't even stand to be around myself.  I seriously started crying in my car the other day because I saw kids pass by in a limo after their graduation... now that is just not normal (not for me anyways).  The only reason I like it is because I have not gotten pregnant and it keeps my skin clear.  Honestly_ I am surprised my fiance is still with me because I cry all the time_ I never want to have sex_ and I am always depressed.

Pain near right overy. Bloating. Nausea. Unable to loose weight. Mood swings. Tired all the time_ but difficulty sleeping.,I have been on Tri-Previfem for 9 months now. I originally went on it to regulate my period_ but I still never know when to expect it. Some months it will be light and only last a few days_ other times it will be very heavy and last for 5-7 days. My breast were constantly tender for the first 5 months_ now its just once in a while. I have times of abdominal pain near my right overy_ which have me slightly concerned. I feel like I want to cry a lot of the time over the slightest things. Recently I noticed darkness over my upper lip that I can't seem to get rid of_ it looks like I have a mustache_ but it's the skin and not added hair. I was on this before years ago and didn't have any of these side effects. The only good thing I've found about it is not getting pregnant. I would not suggest to anyone in getting the depoprevera shot though_ that totally messed me up.,F,29,28  days,6/11/2007,Ortho tri-cyclen

883, 5, ,,"To Um_ to not get pregnant. That is WONDERFUL that you have not had any issues with your generic drugs_ etc. But please do not make those that have had issues feel bad for being upset or having REAL issues. They can be very very serious. These are not a joke. Yes_ in most cases generic can be very very safe_ otherwise mds would not prescribe them on a regular basis over the ""name brand"" which the name brands can be very safe or very dangerous. Anything you put in your body can cause potential harm. However if the population awareness to the fact that not all drugs are an exact substitute to the drug you were taking_ perhaps some issues could be avoided. See my comments below and you will understand that there is real truth. I have nothing to lie about. I have a beautiful daughter_ a wonderful husband and an amazing career now in the healthcare field.

NO WAY!  Did you guys educate yourselves about birth control at all before signing up for it?,It amazes me how uneducated some of the comments are on here.  My favorites are the statements that ALL generics are bad.  Seriously_ do you guys work for Ortho McNeil?  OK_ maybe you really are allergic to the fillers in generics but not the fillers in the brand drug_ but do you really think the hormone content is significantly different?  It's weird... myself and nearly all my friends are on some type of OTC generic and we don't have any major complaints.

My skin had always been more on the clear side- blessed I know... but lately I have been experiencing pesky blemishes every now and then. I was looking for birth control and Ortho Tri-cyclen is the only birth control approved for acne so I thought- kill 2 birds with one stone!

I personally like the generics more because they cost a great deal less and work the same (for me).

Just because most of the people say that it doesn't work or gives them bad side effects doesn't mean it does that for everyone. I spoke with my pharmacist about some of the reviews I had read and she said that the people have problems probably had a bad reaction to the different fillers in the Trinessa. Anyway_ please don't automatically turn down Trinessa_ especially if it's much cheaper for you than ortho tri-cyclen. I've had acne for about 10 years and had tried EVERYTHING.

I couldn't wait to have sex_ and now I'm not at all interested in it.  This pill has lowered my sex drive like crazy.  I was also very moody when I first started taking it_ but it went away once my body got used to it.  I was very much against taking birth control in the first place (I tried Natural Family Planning for 3 months and could never get the hang of it)_ so when I gave in_ I was very pleased to find out that nothing changed as far as my body is concerned.  I just wish I had a sex drive again_ b/c what's the point of the pill if I never have sex?  Also_ I barely have a period_ which I actually hate.  I was the poster person for perfect periods-- never had a cramp and always had normal/light bleeding_ always on time.  Since taking this pill_ I never bleed_ I only have a thick_ dark discharge.

My periods are 3-4 days long_ before the pill it was a ENITRE week.  I was off for 2 months because I couldn't find time to get another perscription. Now that I am on again I gained another 4 pounds but that can be due to my eating and sleeping habits.,I started on Tri-Sprintec_ the generic of Ortho Tri-Cyclen_ because of my hormonal imbalance during my periods; which made me super cramped_ moody_ dizzy_ vomiting_ unable to do anything for the first 1-2 days. It felt like I was dying. All I did was sleep and I couldn't even do that because the cramps were so bad it kept waking me up. I'm glad that I am on Tri-Sprintec it has made it so so soo much easier to function during my periods. I have a friend who was on Ortho Tri-cyclen and they switched her to Sprintec and it didn't work too well with her. I guess it works for some and not for others.

About four years ago_ I started having breakouts... I'd never had them before.  I figured it was due to my regular face soap being discontinued.

After taking TriNessa for a few months I found out that Trinessa was recalled because the hormone levels were wrong - women were getting pregnant!!!

I went off again for about a month starting mid-January and then started back up a couple weeks ago. So far I've been tired_ developed a large zit (I've always had fair complexion)_ but the worst part is my moods. I freaked out one day and started trashing my place and then I took a few too many anti-anxiety pills to try and calm down because I felt desperately out of control and was almost comatose. I don't know if the pill is the cause but as I read these comments I'm starting to believe so. My husband doesn't feel safe around me. I have a history of depression but it's always been manageable so whenever things come up they tell me to adjust my meds but I think I need to change or get off,F,27,2  years,3/6/2007Email,Ortho tri-cyclen
967, 5, acne,will be getting off Tri-Previfem and starting Ortho Tri-Cyclen this Sunday because I finally FOUND A PLACE THAT SELLS IT FOR CHEAP!!!!,PLEASE NOTE: for those who can't get name brand Ortho Tri-Cyclen for a decent price because of insurance_ PLEASE CHECK OUT PLANNED PARENTHOOD. They are the ONLY place I can get the name brand pills from that are the cheapest! Where I live_ it is $50 for an examination fee (they just ask you questions_ weigh you_ check your blood pressure_ and that is it). If you've been to planned parenthood before_ it will only cost you $35 for your examination. A MONTH SUPPLY OF PILLS IS ONLY $25/MONTH. If you average this out_ you are only paying $29/month every year. (You have to pay the examination fee once every year to renew your prescription.) For anyone who is stuck on generic and want to switch to the real thing_ please check out Planned Parenthood's website. If I went anywhere else_ I would be paying well over $40 per month!,F,20,0  days,3/1/2007Email,Ortho tri-cyclen

My doctor kept on saying it's just the first year or so_ it'll change.. after 2 1/2 years it never did and I was so sick of planning vacations_ etc. around the time when I thought I wouldn't be on my period but ended up being that I switched doctors and demanded a different pill.

If you have used OTC in the past and are looking to try the generic_ I encourage you to at least TRY. When reading all the negative report on this site_ keep in mind... (1) your body chemistry changes as you get older. If you were previously on OTC and are switching back_ it could be that your body chemistry needs to adjust_ and it has nothing to do with the generic at all.

She had her doctor give her the lowest dosage of hormones there was and she seems to be fine now. I also have broken out ALOT and I thought I was done with that stuff when I was 16.

1008, 5, acne,I HAVE ALREADY POSTED BEFORE BUT FORGOT TO MENTION ONE MORE THING. I have never taken OTC but have been on Tri-Previfem for 5 months. I_ too_ experienced rash-like bumps all over my stomach_ some on my thighs_ upper arms_ and a few on my back.,"I went to the dermatologist to get these rash-like bumps tested and they asked if I was on any medications. I told them I was on BC. They tested to see if it was JUST an allergic reaction to BC but it came out to be ""pityriasis rosea"". I NEVER had it before and was certain Tri-Previfem had caused it. Apparently the skin disease I was diagnosed with was a 1-time thing_ and doctors don't know how people get it. I thought I had poison ivy or some sort and was afraid to touch anything and anybody. It went away in about a month and good thing was it wasn't contagious and the dermatologist gave me topical cream to help with the itching (but it wasn't really itchy with me).

1009, 3, clear up acne,I am actually taking the generic Tri-Previfem_ which I expected to work just like OTC. My periods started earlier than expected_ had break-through bleeding the first 3-months_ LONGER periods (1 and a half weeks!)_ periods weren't significantly lighter AT ALL_ my breasts were EXTREMELY tender and sore_ gained more than 5 pounds even though I haven't changed my eating habits and usually I stay pretty thin_ and my sex drive is pretty much destroyed!!! and sometimes I get moody for no reason!; Tri-previfem did clear up SOME acne_ but I STILL have to use additional topical medications such as Benzol Peroxide every night to keep my skin from flaring up the next morning! The whole reason I wanted to get on BC was to help my acne. Insurance won't cover the name brand OTC and I really don't have the $$ to spend $60 every month...I'm a poor college student just tryin to find a simple way to have clear skin! HAS ANYONE ELSE TRIED TRI-PREVIFEM? Has anyone had problems with this kind of,"IF ANYONE HAS TRIED THE GENERIC ""TRI-PREVIFEM"" PLEASE LET ME KNOW! I will get off of this and pay the extra 40 bucks a month if it's really better than tri-previfem! And again_ the main reason I wanted BC was for my acne!

1013, 5, for menstrual cramps and acne,First my insurance did not cover the brand name Ortho_ so they gave me Tri-sprintec. I hated it.  I had headaches_ weight loss_ still got cramps during my period and the worse thing it did not clear up my acne.  I wanted to give the tri-sprintec time to work_ but then the pharmacist said that they did not have it and gave me trinessa.  Oh my god_ that is the worse bcp i have taken.  i had the worse acne and migraines.  So in December_after arguing on the phone with the doctor whom says that trinessa is just the same os ortho_ i went to the pharmacy and asked and paid($59.00)for a month supply of the brand name ortho tri-cyclen and i am so happy. This month i had no cramps_ and right now i dont have any active acne and i am looking cute.,Love it.,F,33,1  days,1/10/2007,Ortho tri-cyclen

1016, 1, Birth Control,Anxiety and panic attacks_ heart palpitations_ breakthrough bleeding,It wasn't until last year that I came to the conclusion that birth control pills were the probable cause of my anxiety problem.  I went to countless doctors about heart palpitations (even a cardiologist) and none of them made the connection to birth control pills. I stopped taking the pills five months ago_ and it's been a rough road getting my body back to normal.  I never had any health problems before using the pill_ and I am mad at myself for not doing more research before I started taking them and mad that I stayed on them for nine years. I would advise any woman to think twice and do plenty of research before using hormonal methods of birth control.  I am now on my sixth month without the pill and feeling better every day!,F,32,9  years,1/6/2007,Ortho tri-cyclen

For the first time in my life_ I've somehow decided that spanking is the way to go with my 19 month old.  I used to be soooo against it.  I'm crying before and after she gets spanked.  I hate it.  My sex drive is pretty crappy too.  My poor husband...  I also get these awful_ sudden headaches.  I was up for an hour late last night_ unable to fall asleep (even after taking two extra strength Excedrin).  Oh my gosh!  I have even had brief moments of blurred vision in one eye.  Blurred isn't the word; the vision in my left eye went ""black"" for a second.  Very scary.  Did I mention I cry all the time?  This is not me. I just hate it.

All I know is first thing tomorrow I am calling my doctor.  I threw my pill pack in the garbage and I am NOT taking it anymore.

1023, 3, Birth Control,I was on Trinessa the generic for Ortho Tri-Cyclen. Headaches_ CONSTANT Nausea_ depression_ anxiety_ shortness of breath and no sex-drive. It has taken me a year to figure out that it could be my birth control that was causing all these problems! I looked up the manufactures listed side effects and every simgle thing I have been dealing with is listed! Why didn't my doctor tell me this!?,I had no idea that Trinessa could cause all of the problems I have been having. I have had at least 5 pregnancy tests in the last year because of the nausea_ I have never been pregnant_ but none of my doctors told me it could be my birth control that was making me feel that way. The anxiety/depression is what has really been driving me nuts. I have felt like I was going crazy. Since finding this forum I have stopped taking my birth control and the nausea has almost completely stopped_ the anxiety also seems to be decreasing_ I have actually had some good days lately.

On the other hand_ my sex drive is *gone*. Ive suspected this for a long time but its been proven now that I have been off of it for 1 month_ going into 2. I had to have a course of antibiotics following the extraction of my wisdom teeth and was told antibiotics can cause Birth Control pills to become ineffectual. As a result of that and finding it very hard to take the pill on time during my recovery_ I discontinued use temporarily. I missed my opportunity to start my next pack so I am now in the fertile stage of my cycle without the pill in my system and have noticed a dramatic increase in my sex drive.,F,24,1.3  years,12/28/2006,Ortho tri-cyclen

Went off birth control entirely for money reasons... and later was offered ""OTC"" from a friend who had an allergic reaction to it ""but still had three months of completely sealed_ just purchased OTC for anyone it does work for."" It wasn't brand name OTC - it was MonoNessa. I felt a bit wonky the first month - heart palpatations_ weird little nonsevere pains in my left arm_ hand_ and left side of my throat. Thought this was smoothing out at the end of my first month... actually_ it's just cuz I went off the hormones for period week. I'm a week into my second month and starting to have more obnoxious chest_ arm_ and neck pain - and then I read this website and I am thoroughly sketched out and stopping now. Never had high blood pressure or heart problems before... but I'm paranoid.",MonoNessa is NOT the same thing as OTC.

1031, 5, Birth Control,No noticeable weightgain_ although my acne was mild I believe it has helped slightly_ I feel moodier than I was prior to beginning OTC,When I first started taking birth control I was prescribed OTC lo to use the lowest hormones necessary but it wasn't enough because I was having constant breakthrough bleeding for the first few months and my acne remained unchanged.  I was then switched to the regular OTC and it has been wonderful so far.  Fully effective for the reason I've taken it_ to prevent pregnancy!  The only drawback I've noticed since I started taking OTC_ even the lo_ was more moodiness.  I felt slightly more depressed at times and easily brought to tears.  Although I'm not sure this had to do with the birthcontrol I don't know what else it could possibly have been caused by.  But in general I definitely recommend Orth Tri Cyclen!!!,F,19,1  years,12/26/2006,Ortho tri-cyclen

Mostly slight nausea_ and mood swings. Also loss of sex drive_ and crying spells. My idiot pharmacist got the perscription wrong_ and gave me Ortho-Tri-Cyclen (the stronger dose). Since I started taking it_ I experienced the terrible symptoms. I would not recommend switching from OTC LO to regular OTC. I love OTC LO. It is great.

So I wound up on Zovia then TriNessa.,I have been on TriNessa for two years and couldn't figure out why I had sudden rages_ crying jags_hair cropping up after having paid for electrolysis three years before And 50lbs when I haven't changed my eating habits. Well thank you ladies for making me see I'm not suffering from aging but my form of birth control pill. I'm going back to OTC immediately. TRINESSA IS A GENERIC PILL NIGHTMARE.

Well_ I now am realizing all my problems this month with how I feel are stemming from this new pill. Now I don't know what pill to try! I thought this one was lower in hormones_ so I figured the less hormones_ the less side effects. NOPE! I am a basket-case. I will be calling my Gyno on Monday to have her switch me to something else (again). This is such a pain in the ass.

1050, 4, Acne,Nothing really significant or noticeable.,I took Ortho Tri-Cyclen in high school for acne_ and then started again my freshmen year of college. Both times it really helped my skin. This summer_ I went off birth control completely (just to give my body a break) but decided to go back on it when school started because I'm prone to breakouts in the winter and during school. My skin looked the best it had every looked_ but I thought_ better safe than sorry. But the insurance company put me on Trinessa and it has been a NIGHTMARE. I've broken out SO bad on my face_ chest_ and back. It has been going one for almost 3 months now and I couldn't figure out why the bc wasn't helping and why it was just getting worse and worse but now I believe from reading the other comments that it has been the Trinessa all along. In addition to the acne_ I've also gained weight_ and I now burst into tears at things that normally I could handle_ like my mom yelling at me. It's basically reversing the positive effects of my antidepressants. Don't take Tr,F,20,3  months,11/26/2006Email,Ortho tri-cyclen

1052, 1, pregnancy preventio_ acne_,WEIGHT GAIN_ INTENSE MOODINESS_ FATIGUE_ ACNE,The reason why I took the pill was for myself to stop worrying about getting pregnant and because I heard it was going to clear up my skin. Instead this pill DID NOTHING FOR ME. The only gain was I didn't have to worry about being pregnant but the intense moodiness and my weight gain was not pleasant. What is worst is that I feel TIRED ALL the time. I used to be able to go by with 4 hours of sleep a night. Now I can sleep for 10 hours and still be tired. This pill is not right for me and not worth whatever I gain.,F,20,3  months,11/23/2006,Ortho tri-cyclen

It gave me confidence and made me feel like my old self.,Recently I have started taking birth control again_ but I have been swtiched to tri-sprintec 28. I have not had a period in a while_ so I am taking this to regulate. I have had a few breakouts and am on the 16th pill from the 28 pack. I am hoping my periods become regulated again_ and it clears my skin up for good. I am unsure yet as of the effects it will have upon me.

1055, 2, Endometriosis_ retrograde cycles,Bled for 3 months straight.,"Because of my endometriosis and retrograde menustration my ob/gyn determined that it was probably best off to find a way to stop my periods. Due to various reasons Depo and many other things were out of the question. It was then determined that the best form of action was a pill. After already having an allergic reation to one contraceptive pill he decided to try me on a lower estrogen pill. I was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen for about three and a half months. The first three months I had ""breakthough"" bleeding every day_ though this breakthrough bleeding was more like a full-blown period. After three months of getting irriated at this my ob/gyn told me to start taking two of them a day instead of one_ this finally managed to stop the bleeding but it was irritating having to take the pills so often. Within a half month I was switched to another birth control pill.",F,19,3  months,11/17/2006Email,Ortho tri-cyclen

1072, 5, contraception_ light periods_ acne,I have been on several brands_ Alesse (and aviane the generic)_ Yasmin and OTC lo. I love Alesse/aviane. I went from 7 day periods and fairly heavy cycle to 1 day or less and it was light enough that I didn't *need* any feminine products! I tried OTC lo w/samples from the doc to help my face. It went fine_ the first month I felt weird_ but it cleared up w/the next pack. I started Tri-Nessa b/c I wanted a higher hormone dose b/c my periods were getting longer and Tri-Nessa was cheaper (my ins. doesn't cover BC)...IT IS AWFUL. Thank GOD for this site.,On Tri-Nessa now for 2 months. I cry for no reason at all (which drives my bf nuts)_ am moody and I have had the worst period in 6.5 yrs (since I started BC). It's like I'm not even on it. Bad cramps (which I've never had at all)_ heavy bleeding_ tried to start 1.5 weeks early while still taking active pills. It is the worst ever. I found this site_ called the pharmacist just now and they are filling the next round w/regular OTC. It has got to be better than this. If not_ I will def. go back to Alesse and a 1 day period. DO NOT TAKE TRI-NESSA. IT IS HORRIBLE.,F,25,2  months,10/20/2006,Ortho tri-cyclen
1073, 1, Birth Control,I was taking the generic version_ trinessa_ for 6 months.  The first few months were fine_ then I got my first ever migraine.  I didn't associate the two.  But_ then I had another migraine.  It seems a bit odd for a person who has never had a migraine to have two within 2 months.  The worst part though was I had extreme fatigue.  I just could not get enough sleep.  Even after 10 hours of sleep_ I could barely stay awake.  Also_ I was irritable and would get extremely angry.  I also had 2 yeast infections_ and as with migraines_ I never had a yeast infection before.  I have been off the pill for about 3 weeks_ and I am no longer fatigued.  As for the rest of the side effects_ I will monitor and see.,The positives for the drug are that it cleared up my skin_ and I actually lost a few pounds.

When I first started it it was great_ my skin looked like porcelain.  After 3 months_ I started getting my period early and it would last for over 10 days.  I would also be seriously emotional right before the placebo pills.  I have been trying to find an OC that does what it says it does without any side effects and I have tried Ovcon 35_ Ovcon 50_ Ortho Tri-Cyclen_ Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo_ Yasmin and have had breakthrough bleeding_ acne_ and mood swings with all of them.  Loestrin 24 Fe has been the one that has actually worked for me and I really only get a 3 day period!

I am so relieved that it is not just me. I have never had a panic attack in my life! I have also been very grouchy and moody. My husband has been telling me for the past year that I have changed.

That slight difference in the amount of horomones really changes everything. Maybe Ortho Tri-Cyclen works for some women_ but it's making my life a living hell.

1118, 3, Birth Control / Painful Cramps,Scheduled mood shifts!,Hey there folks. I wanted to post here to ask for feedback as well provide my observations. I know I am just an onlooker however I have noticed a pattern in my girlfriends mood. As the pills are portioned as a 4 week_ 3 on 1 off_ I refer to this cycle. Starting back on the pills_ week one and two are noted as a very positive and if you will happy ramp up onto the drug. Week three I begin to notice a more neutral and somewhat impatient mood. And for the forth week is filled with irritation_ frustration_ unease and confusion. I have dated a women both on and off birth control. I am curious as to whether OTC is creating this predictable mood schedule? Are these states of mind typical of women off of OTC_ namely confusion? And if these states of mind are typical of a womans cycle is OTC helping to regulate these moods_ i.e. improving their predictability? My hope is that not everyone on OTC has this predictable mood schedule mood_ and we can explore alternative birth control,M,24,3  years,8/3/2006,Ortho tri-cyclen

I also had to wear pantyliners every single day because of potential_ regular spotting; but I'd take this over what the pills did to my mentality.

The pharmacy I use used Tri Sprintec for a generic. I have been on the generic form for about 12 months now. Since then I have gained 10 pounds with no change in my diet or exerise habits. I have to wear pantiliners all the time because of spotting. I am so ridicously moody_ I can't stand myself sometimes. I even went so far as to go on antidepressants thinking it would help. My doctor put me on Cymbalta which I do not recommend. They worked for about 6 months then totally stopped working. The side effects of coming off of them were pure hell. Severe headaches_ nausea_ dizziness_ major drop in BP_ shakiness_ feeling like you are constantly being given an electric shock. Well anyway_ I never had this problem on Ortho Tri-Cyclen.

I am 25_ slim_ dont' smoke_ never had any health issues before. I found this article: http://www.holistic-online.com/cancer/cancer_news_cervical_cancer-and-birth-control-pills.htm.  It basically says that almost all the women are or will be infected with the HPV virus in the life.  Taking birth control pills significantly increases the risk of getting cervical cancer.

I got them so often that I was taking Advil like they were m&m's chocolate candy. I would finish a family sized bottle from Costco entirely on my own in one year! Talk about mood swings and being angry in life. Every slight thing would throw me into a tailspill and I would retaliate with cutting remarks. My sister tried to tell me to let things role off my back and I would enjoy life better. But I couldn't_ everything was bad_ everything depressed me. I would at times not leave the house. I thought about suicide and couldn't understand because on paper I had everything good in life. My hands and feet swelled too and every activity became laborous so I became a depressed couch potato.

I had to switch to the generic Trinessa because my insurance company didn't cover it any longer.  My breasts were so sore and I became so moody.  I was mad for no reason and cry for no reason.  I was ALWAYS mad.  I kept saying that it was the generic_ but everyone kept telling me that it can't be because the active ingredient in a generic must be the same as the brand name_ so I really shouldn't have any different side effects. I really thought I was going crazy...until...yesterday_ when I went to refill my prescription_ my pharmacist told me that Trinessa has been recalled!  I flipped and asked why.  He told me he didn't know the exact reason why_ but it could be something as menial as the color of the pills were wrong.  So basically_ nothing serious.

I was informed by the pharm that both products came from the same manufacturer that the acne was from XMAS stress...  strange that OTC raised their prices so badly that insurance had to convert to Trinessa - to find that it has been recalled?

So I went to the doctors and they ran different blood tests to figure out what it was and they still don't know_ $700.00 later. I thought it was a bladder infection_ because I keep having to go pee every few minutes. But I think it's the pill_ because it tricks your body into thinking it's pregnant when it's not and maybe I'm having side effects like I am pregnant.

I am sitting here right now with my left eye swollen and I have a horrible headache from the pressure. Trinessa is probably the culprit! Headaches_ edema (water retention)_ moodiness_ nausea_ dizziness!

My pharmacy gave me the generic trinessa. I have been incredibly moody. Doing 180 degree mood swings_ going from happy to pissed off in minutes. I cry ALL the time and my boyfriend gets the blunt of all of this. I've been so afraid of losing him because of the way I was acting. The whole time I've been thinking it was the person I was. I would have panic attacks_ start fights being pissed off and end them crying uncontrollably. Reading all these things is like a sigh of relief...I honestly thought I was going CRAZY. Is regular Ortho good for acne still? Reading most of the posts about the Ortho Lo I want to stay away from that because it seems some become pregnant. DEFINITELY switching though...,stay away from trinessa unless you would like to become the DEVIL!!! I didn't experience any side effects other than going crazy. My face cleared up recently but i'm not sure if it is because of the birth control or my recent visits to my dermotologist. I'll stick to my dermotologist and lose the trinessa. I've lived with acne since i was 12...but I can't live without my boyfriend. Thank god he's very understanding.

I've also been extremely fatigued_ and I used to be active with running 3x a week and swimming 2x. In addition to all these it has become difficult for me to wear my contacts as my eyes are really dry_ I can only wear them about 9 hours a day.,I don't know if anyone else has experienced this_ I dodn't know how you could start out fine on this pill and then develop these side effects after 2 years of continual use.  I hate these effects_ but I'm also apprehensive to go off the pill due to the memories of how painful my breasts would become_ and how severe my cramps were. Not to mention the acne... My doctor doesn't seem to think these are all related_ but becasue of my stupid insurance I can't afford to do the tests he wants to run (I would have to pay out of pocket for them).

I break out&look like a teenager_ my nipples are extremely tender_ and I have just been diagnosed with ovarian cysts (rare being on the pill).

1237, 5, birth control,Ortho Tri-Cyclen is fabulous -- I feel completely normal when I'm on it and it helps control my cramps and period length. My pharmacy gave me the generic brand Trinessa and I have been living a constant nightmare since then. My anxiety has spiked through the roof and I feel completely depressed. Everything annoys me and I can't get any enjoyment out of ANYTHING! I feel like I'm clinically depressed all over again. What's scary is how quickly the Trinessa affected me! Within a week_ I went from being a positive_ energetic_ in love woman to a weepy_ paranoid_ asexual mess. Trinessa is HORRIBLE! It is SO worth it to pay the extra money to be on the Ortho Tri Cyclen. I am vastly relieved that I found this site because I thought I was going nuts. I wonder how long it will take to get this poison out of my system!Somebody needs to let the powers that be know that Trinessa needs to be pulled off the market!,,F,28,5  years,1/5/2006,Ortho tri-cyclen

1240, 5, Birth Control,Trinessa is horrible_ Ortho Tri-Cyclen is great!,I was taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen since I was 18 (12 years ago) and it was great.  Had a few symptoms at first but they went away within a month or two.  I went off the pill to get pregnant.  Had a baby and told the doctor I wanted Ortho Tri-Cyclen again...but the pharmacy gave me Trinessa (generic for Ortho).  I have been on Trinessa for a year and a half and have been MISERABLE.  I thought I was going seriously CRAZY.  I'm not one to usually post anything on the internet...but EVERYONE needs to know how bad Trinessa is.  It made me very depressed (I'm not normally depressed)_ VERY moody_ gained A LOT of weight_ NO sex drive_ and horrible headaches.  I was considering going to get mental help from a professional but I've been off Trinessa for a few weeks and went back to Ortho Tri-cyclen and I feel great (I hope to lose some of this weight).  Don't get Trinessa...you will regret it.  It should be taken off the market and is the worst drug I have ever taken.  Pay extra for the brand name!!,F,30,12  years,1/3/2006,Ortho tri-cyclen

I've taken this pill for almost a month now.  I think it will take three months for my body to adapt to it.So far:I do feel more insecure_ although not depressed.  Just a bit more emotional.  Tearier.  I get more insecure around the week before my green pills_ when I'm premenstrual.  It's more emotionally intense for me than normal pms.  However_ I am happier because I'm in LESS pain.  Significantly less pain.  I'm looking fwd to regular_ lighter periods and less hormonal pain.  My skin looks good_ but I still break out during PMS.

After reading this message bored I realize that I am not alone.  I also lost sex drive which was causing problems with my boyfriend.  I questioned the change to TriNessia but since I was told it was no different than my other pill I thought that it was me becoming neurotic.

She said it was the same as ortho_ but I was a bit worried b/c I understand that a change in meds could have major side effects_ so I took the meds but knew I would need to do some research before I popped one.  From all the comments_ I refuse to take a chance with TriNessa b/c I just recently started back on ortho the past 3 mths and am losing weight.  Not to mention_ I don't need the psychological probs while I'm starting a new job!  Thanks again for the comments_ you don't know how much it has helped in my decision to take control of my health and demand to stay on ortho.  Whatever the price is I will pay.  For anyone that might not be able to afford ortho_ I would try contacting Planned Parenthood.  They sell BC at low costs depending on your income bracket and the ones I have been to are friendly & understanding_ not matter what the sitch is.,F,24,5  years,8/21/2005Email,Ortho tri-cyclen
1286, 5, regulate,UPDATE,UPDATE!!! I posted a comment last week about trinessa. I have lost 11 of the 40 pounds I put on while on trinessa in the last week.I drank losts of water took one step class on wednesday but the real difference came today when I sat in the steam room at the gym to shed water weight from the pills. 5 and a half pounds sweat out of me in a 20 minute steam session. Ladies if you have access to a steam room I highly recommend moderate usage to get rid of that shit that trinessa has delt us all. I am going to be me again!!! This will be my second week without trinessa. My breasts feel much better_ I can even sleep face down like I like to. I had great sex today for a change and I the weight is coming off. Quit Trinessa and feel the difference.,F,, ,8/20/2005,Ortho tri-cyclen
1287, 1, ,,I was never given the name brand Ortho; I was given Tri-Nessa. I t has been awful!!! I have thought I was pregnant because of constant nausea. I am breaking out_ and have had horrible weight gain. The mood swings haven't been pretty either.

1289, 5, Endometriosis treatment,I have always been on Ortho Tri-Cyclen.  In January 2005 I was put on Tri-Nessa_ tried it to save money.  Had terrible mood swings the first three months and they have now tapered off.  I used to never be like this on Ortho Tri-Cyclen.  I would cry at the drop of a hat_ become angry over nothing important and extremely stressed for no reason.  It was very strange.  I have stuck with the Tri-Nessa_ just to see if it would go away_ and it has.  But since I've switched to Tri-Nessa_ I have been getting yeast infections.  I don't know if it's the pill_ and I'm going to go to the doctor again to make sure I'm ok_ but I have never had a yeast infection till I switched to Tri-Nessa. It could be age_ and definitely stress and food could be the culprit_ but it could also be the pill_ esp right before my period.  I think next go around I'm going to go back to Ortho TRi-Cyclen.  I never had any problems and things always ran smoothly.,,F,28,8  years,8/18/2005,Ortho tri-cyclen

1291, 5, regulate,ortho tricyclen is great! trinessa sucks!!!don't do it!!,Over the last year I have gained 40 pounds! I look and feel horrible. I thought I was going into early menopause because I have no desire to sleep with anyone. I thought that the pain in in my breasts was complications of implants I got a couple of years ago so I learned to live with the pain. I am a singer and my appearance is my living. My audience does not recognize me so I have resorted to playing beer joints instead of casinos and social functions because I am so embarrased of my appearance. I tried adkins diet and gained weight. The gym... gained weight starving_ six small meals everything gained more weight. My bro in law asked me what kind of bc I was taking. It hit me that the insurance company had switched me to trinessa. I can't believe I could have remedied this situation a year ago and not had to suffer these horrible circumstances wondering if my life was over as I had always known it. I am paying 45 a month for a gym membership I would not need if they would not have switched me. Ortho is great! Trinessa will change every aspect of your life for the worse.,F,37, ,8/14/2005,Ortho tri-cyclen
1292, 3, birth control,Trisprintec--lighter periods_ less cramping_ clearing up of my face...basically all the positive a birth control is supposed to do. Tri nessa--bloating_ extra cramping_ more acne_ crazy mood swings_ tender breasts_ nausea_ lack of sexual desire.,My doctor actually prescribed trisprintec for me and it worked GREAT! I had lighter periods and they were more regular and it even cleared up a lot of my acne. When I moved the pharmacy only had tri nessa and so I thought it would be exactly like trisprintec. I thought wrong. I completely lost my desire to have almost any kind of intimacy with my husband. Then_ about a month after being on tri nessa_ I started having ALL the symptoms of pregnancy. So_ I thought I had somehow missed a pill and gotten pregnant. But not only all that_ I had some major grumpiness. EVERYTHING annoyed me. My husband tickling me drove me nuts. When he would tease me it made me mad. I'm not a grumpy person normally. Well_ I've been off of tri nessa for about a week now and while I'm still having some of the same symptoms (such as tender breasts and nausea) I am happy when my husband teases me_ I don't burst out in tears at every little thing he says and I think even the bloating is subsiding a little bit.,F,20,7  months,8/13/2005,Ortho tri-cyclen
1293, 3, birth control,I took this pill for 4 years during college_ quit for 2 years_ then went back to it about 6 months ago.  The first 4 years I took it_ I experienced no side effects except for minor breakthrough bleeding.  When I started taking it again_ I had some nausea the first month_ which eventually went away.  BUT_ for these entire 6 months_ I experienced break-through bleeding every month to the point that it was like a second period.  Rather awkward and inconvenient for sex.  Also_ I started having problems with acne_ which I had never had in my life.  The worst side effect_ however_ was that I started getting yeast infections every month right before my period.  After 3 months of this_ the infections were not responding to treatment (HELL!) so my doctor switched me to Ovcon_ which seems to have fixed this problem.,Obviously everyone responds differently to birth control_ and you can even respond in different ways at different points in your life.  So you never know what will happen.  I suggest to anyone that if you experience unpleasant side effects with birth control pills_ you should ask your doctor about switching to another brand_ since there are so many different kinds.  A lot of people just quit the pill altogether_ which isn't necessarily a good idea.,F,24,6  months,8/13/2005,Ortho tri-cyclen

1314, 1, Birth Control,Weight gain_ headaches (migraines)_ feelings of depression_ anger and extreme irritability_ no sexual desire and/or arousal_ extreme PMS symptoms and bloating_ and no energy.,I have never taken the brand name Ortho Tri-Cylen but I have taken both generics of Tri-Nessa and Tri-Spintec.  I HATE them both!!  I would NOT recommend either of them to anyone.  The only other BCP I have taken is Ortho Novum 7/7/7 which I had taken for years before being put on the Ortho Tri-Cyclen 3 years ago after the birth of my last child. I loved those and had no problems whatsoever on them.  I recently saw my OB/GYN about this very issue and was told that it is very unlikely that the Ortho Tri-Cyclen (or any other BCP) would cause thse symptoms.  However_ she said she would gladly switch me back to the Ortho Novum 7/7/7 if that was my wish.  I am considering trying the Mirena IUD as I have heard good things about it but I may just stick with what I know and go back on the triple 7s.  The sad thing is that it has taken me 2 years to figure out what has been causing my weight gain (25-30 lbs)_ headaches_ bloating_ depression_ loss of sexual desire and irritability and anger problems.  I never knew that oral contraceptives could cause these types of extreme problems until I watched Dr. Drew's sex show one night.  It really opened my eyes.

Bloating_ water retention_cramping out of no where_ I am so emotional I feel as if I am going insain_ light-headidness_ and feeling almost like I am pregnant.  Luckily_ I have only been on it for 2 mos and caught the signs early enough to stop taking it!!!!  I am not sure if I've gained weight... maybe just a few pounds.  But I feel like I've gained 50 with the bloating.  They need to take this drug of the market_and insurance companies need to stop being cheap and pay for the brand name.  Never take Tri-Nessa!!!!!!!!,If you are taking ortho tri-cyclin don't let your insurance company switch you to the generic.  Pay the extra for the brand name.

1338, 5, acne,minor fluid retention,I have taken many different types of birth control pills over the years and ortho tri-cylen was by far the best. When it became a generic recently and I saw how much ortho had become I gladly switched. It took awhile for me to figure it out but generic form called Trinessa has dramatically effected my life and not in a good way. I did not gain any weight while on ortho but since i've been on Trinessa in the last year I have gone up 2 dress sizes. I have never been this big in my life!!! My breasts have increased to a D from a C_ it's not a good thing! My sex drive has dramatically decreased to almost inexistent. Ortho was just the opposite. For the last few months I have side effects that feel like,F,36,15  months,5/14/2005,Ortho tri-cyclen
1339, 5, acne,felt great,I have taken ortho tri-cylen many times over the last several years and everything was going great til I switched to the generic Trinessa. I actually lost weight when i took ortho but since I have been on Trinessa I have gained 15 lbs and my activity level and eating have not changed. I also have had awful periods_heavy and painful_ my breasts are huge_ my acne is horrible_ i have morning sickness symptoms and hot flashes. After reading posts here I am switching back to ortho. OMG_ I just called Walmart and found out the price difference is only $10! I suffered this much for $10 that is ridiculous.,F,33,6  months,5/14/2005,Ortho tri-cyclen
1340, 5, For birth control/acne,I took ortho-tri-cyclen for about 4 years_ then I was switched to Tri-Sprintec.  It was aweful_ I experienced weight gain and also bleeding inbetween periods.

1341, 4, Birth control,Ortho TriCyclen- 5+ yrs_ Tri Nessa- few months_ Tri Sprintec- (currently using) 1+ yr. I got PMS depression and fatigue with Ortho & Trinessa that lasted all through my period. Other than that no problems. On TriSprintec for the first few months I got symptoms very similar to pregnancy- unusual soreness_ nausea_ weight gain. The symptoms went away after 2-3 mths_ but I notice I'm still gaining weight more than usual. The upside to that is it's forcing me exercise regularly whether I want to or not :) And my periods which were always fairly heavy have gotten a LOT lighter and less painful! I still get some of the odd preggy symptoms just before my period_ but they're usually mild.,I've always had acne and none of the pills really helped it.

1342, 1, To treat acne,In one month I experienced weight gain (over 5 lbs in one month!)_ bloating_ feeling heavy all the time_ cramps_ breasts became HUGE and were sore all the time_ constantly hungry_ depressed_ anxious_ difficulty making decisions_ serious lack of energy_ migraines two weeks in a row (so bad I couldn't get out of bed all day.) And_ I still am waiting to get my period.,I was on Trinessa -- not the brand name. It is horrible. It may have helped with my acne_ but I am also on antibiotics to control the acne. It made my life from good to pretty bad in one month! Do not take this generic!!!!!,F,29,1  months,5/10/2005,Ortho tri-cyclen
1343, 5, contraceptive,I took the original ortho tricyclen for 10 years with no side effects (it was wonderful!)_ then went off to have my first child.  When it was time to start back on birth control after my baby was born_ I decided to try the generic brand since it was half the cost (I couldn't believe the ortho brand was up to almost $50_ and my insurance pays nothing for BC pills).  I've been taking trinessa for about 4 months now_ and I've been gaining weight like crazy_ have huge sore breasts and have terrible headaches and mood swings during the 2nd half of my cycle.  I've thought I was pregnant every month on this pill_ because the symptoms are so similar!  I'm so glad it finally occurred to me that it could be my pills_ and this website has confirmed it.  Trinessa is going into the trash today.,The Ortho brand is the only way to go.  I will bite the bullet and pay the extra cost for the brand name from now on.,F,35,10  years,5/9/2005,Ortho tri-cyclen

Could not lose the weight despite working out regularly and eating really good.  At the time I contributed the weight gain to other health issues at the time.  Now_ a year later_ I discovered it is the TriNessa.  In the last two months I've gained 10 pounds.  I was killing myself working out and eating practically nothing to lose the weight and I kept gaining.  I am about to start Ortho tri Lo.  I can't wait.  I hope the this weight comes off and breast tenderness goes away!!!  I was amazed with this website.  I'm so glad that I found it!  DON'T TAKE THE GENERIC TRINESSA!

1396, 5, Regulate Cycle/moderate cramps,None!!!,I had been taking Ortho for 9 years.   About 3 months ago I switched to the generic Trinessa...simply because I was trying to save money.  Since then_ I have experienced almost every issue most patients have commented on here.   The mood swings weren't as bad...  I just find myself on edge 24-7.   The littlest things seem to tick me off.    I have acne all MONTH long_ when I didn't even really have it when I was a teenager.   Worst of all_ I believe I have developed a cervical polyp (which can be caused by increased estrogen levels) and I had an abnormal pap which led to them doing a (MOST UNCOMFORTABLE) biospy...which now I believe was the cause of the BC!   The biopsy came back inconclusive and I have to repeat my pap in 6 months.,F,28,9  years,3/9/2005,Ortho tri-cyclen

1405, 5, birth control,Weight gain,I read all the comments about Tri Nessa and Tri Sprintec and was amazed!  I was switched to tri nessa awhile ago and had had perfectly normal blood pressure with ortho tri cyclen and now my BP has skyrocketed and I've had dizzy spells.  I didn't know what was causing it...but now I'm definitely suspicious that it was tri nessa.

When I was diagnosed with PCOS_ though_ the insurance insisted on the generic-TRINESSA.  I've been on it almost a year now and I started getting these symptoms_ especially SEVERE migraine_ about 5 or 6 mos ago.  With all the other problems associated with PCOS_ I couldn't figure out for a while where the symptoms were coming from_ especially the anger.  I felt like I was going crazy.  Really affecting my sex life with my husband. I was already depressed_ so this made it worse.  I got on-line to find a side-effects listing and found this site_ which is showing me I'm not alone!  I'm now convinced it's the Trinessa.  Trinessa is NOT a good copy of Ortho Tri-Cyclen and you can believe me because I am not selling anything!,F,29,1  years,2/17/2005,Ortho tri-cyclen

I also have tried generics (Cilest_ Tri-Nessa)to save money and within one month the symptoms started to return.

1456, 5, general reason/birth control,None_ no break outs_ no weight gaining_ light periods,Loved it when I was on it. I was off for about a year and resently got on Trinessa and I have been on it for about 2 months and I HATE IT! My boyfriend can not keep up with the mood swings_ I have either gained or just bloated_ I feel horrible_ my breast are tender and they hurt_ no sex drive_ I am switching back to Ortho.,F,28,3  years,11/18/2004,Ortho tri-cyclen
1457, 4, Birth Control and Acne,On Ortho Tri-Cyclen_ no major side effects.  Acne cleared up beautifully.,Ortho TriCylen has proven extremely effective for my skin.  However_ I have tried Trinessa_ the generic_ and I would like to inform women out there that Trinessa can cause tremendous side effects_ when Ortho TriCyclen does not.  I experienced the most horrible depression of my life while taking Trinessa_ yet had a completely normal experience on Ortho TriCyclen.  I come from a family of physicians who told me that generics may vary up to 20% from the brand name.  When you are speaking of a very high estrogen pill_ 20% can be far too much of a hormonal increase.  BE VERY CAREFUL WITH TRINESSA.  Generics are not necessarily the same as brand names.,F,27,4  years,11/16/2004,Ortho tri-cyclen
1458, 3, Birth control,I first thought I was just breaking out but then realized that I had a rash and was allergic to this pill.

Lighter period_ very mild weight gain (2-4 lbs.),F,20,3  months,11/16/2004,Ortho tri-cyclen
1459, 2, birth control,anger_ severe mood swings_ loss of sex drive_ gained 10 lbs. in 4 months_ frequent headaches_ constant bloating_ more acne break-outs than with any other BC pills_ and longer periods than previous BC pills (Yasmin).,Obviously every woman is different and will react differently to BC pills. Ortho Tri-Cyclen was absolutley HORRIBLE for me. Just switched to Lo-Ovral...we'll see this one works out?,F,26,4  months,11/9/2004,Ortho tri-cyclen

1462, 5, Painful/Irregular periods/BC,Bloating the week before and during period. Still have mood swings_ some months worse than others. Gained 10lbs the first year on it (then lost it fast).,Used to bleed irratically_ often_ heavy for extended lenghts of time (up to 8 days)_ O.T-C made me regular (can set a watch by my period now)_ reduced cramps to first day of cycle - also the severity (used to get sick they were so painful) and amount of flow_ only bleed three days at a time now and use regular feminin products. It's great being like clockwork! I would HIGHLY reccomend this product at the advice of a physician. I've tried one type of low pill and one generic_ girl friend at work got pregnant second month on Trinessa. Will use Ortho for the rest of my non-pregnant_ non-menapousal life!,F,23,5  years,10/26/2004,Ortho tri-cyclen

1465, 4, birth control and acne,moodiness (crying for no reason)_ loss of sex drive_ headaches_ loss of libido_ cured acne,It completely cured my severe acne_ but the mood swings and loss of libido were not worth it.  I was a newlywed with no sex drive... bad news.  I switched to Mircette which seems to be better_ but not for my acne.,F,22,5  months,10/19/2004,Ortho tri-cyclen
1466, 3, birth control,Minor weight gain (less than about 5 pounds). Eventually_ headaches and high blood pressure.,Was way better than any other oral contraceptive I ever tried_ and I think I've tried all of them. No bleeding_ no weird mood swings.,F,34,2  years,10/19/2004,Ortho tri-cyclen

1472, 3, Prevent pregnancy,The first few months were great my breasts increased by a full cup size and I had less break outs.  But after almost 8 months I have experienced weight gain or bloating_ I am not sure which one. I have a very high metobolism and have never had to diet or anything to reamin at my acceptable weight which is 115. I now weigh 122 and I am wondering if I shold stop the pill or not.,I expericend a weight gain of 6 pounds which is overall not very much but I am a small woman and it shows terribly on my body the weight is concentrated around my waist and spare tire area and my thighs which I have never had a problem in that area before.  I have also found that I worry much more now then I did before. I don't have as much confidence as I used to and I have hardly any sex drive at all. I am thinking of possibly switching pills.,F,28,8  months,6/26/2004,Ortho tri-cyclen
1473, 3, Birth control/acne,Haven't experienced too many bad side effects as a result of taking these bc pills. My breasts have doubled in size_ weight gain (and have fat where I've never had fat before) and the worst-mood swings...I've started to notice around month 6 that I fall into depression right before I menstrate and I've never had this problem before. Also tend to have days where I cry for no reason or am just sad without justification.,The one good thing is that it has cleared up my skin tremendously! I use to have this consistent acne and it's now completely gone-took a little over three months of being on ortho to see results.,F,20,6  months,5/20/2004,Ortho tri-cyclen
1474, 3, Contraceptive and to treat Acne,I've had a really rough year emotionally. For a long time I thought my mood swings were due to events in my life (break-up_ move_ job stress) however_ a lot of those events have leveled out and I'm still really moody. I'm beginning to suspect that the pill is the problem.  I'm very moody. I go from extreme sadness and crying to extreme rage. I've spewed more venom at friends and loved ones in the past year than ever before in my life.,The pill has really helped my acne so I don't want to stop completely I just want to try something that doesn't cause me to have mood swings. Has anyone had good experiences with switching?,F,29,13  months,5/3/2004,Ortho tri-cyclen

1478, 4, birth control,breast tenderness_ dryness in eyes_ small amount of weight gain_ hormonal migranes during placebo week,most of the side effects went away after first three months; i had much lighter periods and didn't go through typical pms symptoms as i did before taking any birth control (ie. moodiness_ extreme cramping) but the headaches seem to get worse so my doctor has switched my prescription to mircette,F,26,2  years,4/8/2003,Ortho tri-cyclen
1479, 5, Birth Control,No weight gain.  Mood swings seem to be minimal.  Monthly cycle is consistantly regular.  No spotting.  Did not see a difference in acne.,I recommend this as a first option for birth control.  I have no complaints.,F,25,2  years,8/14/2002,Ortho tri-cyclen
1480, 5, birth control_ pms,Side effects - great skin - totally cleared up my breakouts. There may be a slight loss of libido - but that could also be related to the fact that I work and go to school full time and life has been incredibly stressful.,Do not have sore breasts as with other oral contraceptives. DId not gain weight. Did not lose hair.,F,31,3  years,12/5/2001,Ortho tri-cyclen
1481, 2, birth control_ pms,Extreme moodswings_ all the typical bc side effects in the beginning.,Gyn switched me to Ortho-Cyclin instead to decrease the moodswings. He wanted me on the same hormonal levels all month with my anxiety/depression history. Tri-cyclen is 3 different levels of hormones changing monthly.,F,29,2  years,7/29/2001Email,Ortho tri-cyclen
1482, 3, Adult acne,Dramatic weight gain_ moodiness_ depression_ crying jags and spider veins.,This pill is the first birth control I've been on.  It has helped my acne but not dramatically.  On the plus side_ it is nice knowing exactly when you will get your period and my PMS has decreased.  I rarely have cramping_ breast tenderness and PMS breakouts (above my normal acne).  However_ it has made me feel extremely emotional.  I'm not a big crier but I have cried more in the time since taking the pill than I have in the last five years.  I'm undecided as to whether I will continue or not.,F,29,8  months,7/6/2001,Ortho tri-cyclen
1483, 4, Birth Control,Initial horrible moodiness_ breast tenderness crying jags_ light breakthrough bleeding for two months.  All of this subsided_ and mood swings have leveled out.  Periods are lightening up_ although they were initially very heavy.,I was worried about weight gain_ but hormonal weight gain seems minimal to nonexistent.,F,30,3  months,5/22/2001,Ortho tri-cyclen
