I have been off veramyst for two months and have not had a canker sore since as opposed to having 3 to 4 at a time while on veramyst.,It worked well for my allergies but the side effects were so sever I would not recommend the product.  Also the mental stress that came with the canker sores did not help either.

Almost all symptoms affected my left side; back_ neck_ head_ eye_ ear_ only my right nostril was on that side and spinal disc pain was_ well_ central.,These symptoms came on very slow_ it did not occur to me I was having a reaction the the medication. They became pretty severe. Finally got to a point where I thought I might be having a stroke or worse. Almost stopped at the Emergency room. Set up an appt. with MD_ and it was only afterwards I thought these started after taking the Veramyst. 1 week after stopping it the symptoms started to subside. 3 weeks later they are almost completely gone. The pain in my upper spine is still there but is getting better_ it was also the first symptom I noticed. I'm 48 and in good health. This scared the crap out of me. Thought my life had changed for the worse for the rest of my life. Just so happy it was the med's and not something permanent. Please just be very aware of symptoms if you do take this.

I have not used Veramyst for 48 hours and the headache has decreased significantly_ although still there slightly. I also realize now that I was starting to feel vaguely agitated_ or just not myself_ while on it. It's really too bad because it worked very_ very well for allergies.

My nose bleeds easily_ but am using the NeilMed Sinus Rinse  before spraying and this has cut the bleeding down. Nose bleeds every now and then. Hope the sneezing goes away.,In my case I have a horrible allergy to Cedar/Juniper since it was bad this year and to Live Oak pollen.

33, 2, inflamation of nasal passages,After taking Veramyst and Claritin D per recomendation by ENT dr_ i was hit with deep bouts of depression and a weird type of phychosis. After three weeks_ while at work_ i became violently ill_ throwing up all over teh restroom stall. I was freaking out_ thinking every little problem in my life was far worse than it actually was. I was suicidal_ actually. I was terrified and felt hopless. I was taken to ER and ER dr diagnosed me with vertigo. I disagreed and went home. I was never nauseas_ only getting so 10 seconds before puking. I puked 15 minutes after taking a Claritin D so figured itwas all due to the ephedrine in the Cl D. I stopped taking it and_ over the next week_ started feeling better_ but was still hit with bouts of depression.Two weeks later_ again while at work_ i was overcome with another bout of deep depression and an ill feeling.

34, 1, nasal/sinus inflamation,I first tried this med when being treated for a sinus infection that followed a bout of the flu.  After the first dosage of two sprays per nostril_ I developed a very severe headache (very rare for me).  Wondering if it could be the veramyst_ I discontinued it and the headached vanished. The sinus infection cleared with antibiotics and Mucinex.  About two months later_ I came down with a mild head cold and felt as if some sinus thing was developing.  I decided to give the veramyst a try again.  This time_ I used only one spray each nostril.  The first day_ only some mild headache..thought it could be the sinus infection...so_ I used it the second day too.  Wound up with a TERRIBLE headache...throbbing at the top of the nasal area...took THREE days to feel better with constant pain meds.  Will NEVER use this spray again!!!!!!!,,F,50,2  days,11/18/2009,Veramyst
35, 1, Nasal congestion,Heart arrhythmias and insomnia. I would go to bed at 10pm and always wake up at 3am. This drug can cause insomnia and heart arrhythmias. I also got this same effect from Rhinocort_ which is another steroid nasal spray. It seems all steroid nasal sprays have this effect on me. I will avoid them. I know that steroids can cause heart arrhythmias in pill form_ but_ for ME_ they cause them in nasal sprays as well. I KNOW this to be true.,Veramyst DID work well at clearing the nasal congestion. The benefit was not worth the risk. Heart arrhythmias are too dangerous to risk.Note: I did 2 rounds to be SURE it was VERAMYST causing it and both times after about 10 days_ it occured.,M,39,10  days,9/4/2009,Veramyst
36, 2, major allergys,back pain between shoulder blades. that moved to chest,About 2 days after taking veramyst_ I had major back pain between my shoulder blades. That slowly moved to my side and then my chest. I had no idea what was causing this until I forgot to take the spray one day and the pain lessened. I decided to not take it the next day just to see what would happen. for the first time in weeks I was able to move with out tiers in my eyes from the pain. It took weeks for the pain to dissipate. A month later after I thought I was better_ I got sick again and decide to take veramyst once more but in much smaller amounts. It has been 3 days and the exact pain is back. DO NOT TAKE THIS SPRAY. I went from two sprays in each nostril in the morning and at night. To one spray in each nostril in the morning and I got to say_ the pain is the same. Oh and it didn't clear me up at all.

Since I have stopped taking Veramyst in April 2009_ I have had 3 sinus infections_ spaced about 3 weeks apart. I believe the sinus infections are due to the fact I stopped taking Veramyst. I have had one or two sinus infections in the past_ but never three in one year spaced so close together.

I started it again and after another couple of days the pain came back and became excruciating.  It's taken about 10 days for the pain to go away. I haven't taken it since.  Back pain is listed as a possible side effect - I'm wondering if anyone has experienced this and what it is about this drug that may be causing this side effect?

I am on a very low dose - 1 spray in each nostril once a day.  I was very reluctant to use any steroid nasal spray as I am VERY sensitive to all medications but agreed to give this one a try.  After one week_ I notice little change in my symptoms and in fact think they may be worse.  The dark circles under my eyes are much darker and I am waking up in the middle of the night and unable to get back to sleep. I am also experiencing dull headaches and muscles aches.   I am probably going to stop taking it because it is not helping at this  low dosage and since I am already experiencing side effects_ I am not willing to up the dosage.,F,61,8  days,4/3/2008,Veramyst
