0, 3, sebaceous cyst,chest pain_ heart palpitation and light sensitivity,after 3 days of taking the drug_ the side effects started but it helped reduce the size of my cyst_ which is actually non-life-threatening...it turns out that the side effects of cipro were more life threatening than my illness...i often experience chest pain and difficulty in breathing and my heart beats faster than normal like its going to pop out from my chest..there are times that i experience too much light sensitivity that my face hurts like its already inflamed...so scary...not highly recommended..,F,28,28  days500mg 1X D,2/13/2011,Cipro xr
