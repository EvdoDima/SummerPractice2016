0, 5, Depression and anxiety,Bit of constipation_ postural hypotention_ dry nose. Don't bother me,By far the best AD I have been on. I went on everything in the late 80's through to the 90's. All the SSRIs_ MAOIs and some anti psychotics. SSRIs take away anxiety but did nothing for mood and depression. Made me feel hostile sometimes and numb most of the time. I had far more side effects on the SSRIsThe literature says that it is as effective for panic disorder as the SSRIs and slightly better for depression. New DRs tend to use newer drugs which is a mistake and maybe because of the marketing of the newer drugs. If you are getting a partial response_ you might need to increase but persevere because I find that it is a subtle drug and might take a bit longer. Only one problem_ I live in South Africa and in the last few years they only make the 10mg tablet. It is a hassle taking 15 pills at night :(,M,48,20  years150mg 1X D,5/23/2016Email,Imipramine hcl
1, 5, Depression/Social phobia/Pain/ADD,Constipation_ dry mouth_ euphoria_ weight loss (10 lbs)_ elation_ drowsiness_ dizziness_ brain zaps_ feeling stone (1 hour after taking it),I started imipramine 3 weeks ago and it's by far the best antidepressant. My mood lifted almost instantly and the anxiety and social anxiety are completely gone. It allows me to sleep and it increased my sleep quality. I wake up happy and have the  motivation to do what I have to do. It helps with concentration and ADHD. I take in combination with Vyvanse 40 mg_ Lamictal 100 mg and Wellbutrin 100 mg twice daily. My quality of life is much higher than with other antidepressants I tried in the past: prozac_ zoloft_ Effexor XR_ Celexa_ Lexapro_ Cymbalta_ trazodone_ Elavil_ Abilify_ etc. and nothing is comparable with Imipramine beside Anafranil which is very effective but have more side effects. The side effects are mild and will stay on imipramine for the rest of my life.,M,37,3  weeks75 mg 1X D,5/6/2016,Imipramine hcl

5, 5, panic attacks/depression,dry mouth and elevated pulse,This wonder drug has made all the difference in my life. Began taking it for panic attacks and got immediate relief even though it was supposed to take time to start working. Didn't realize I had been depressed until it made me feel like a new person. About 8 years ago I tried weaning off but found that I needed 75 mg. to feel normal and have emotional buoyancy . So I quickly went back from 50 mg to 75. Over the last year I went from 75 mg down to 25 mg. Felt fine at 25 mg for two months. 25 mg is not supposed to be therapeutic but it IS for me and other people who have left comments! My doctor encouraged me to go off completely--probably because of the myth of 25 mg being nonclinical-- but the insomnia and ever decreasing energy is intolerable. My symptoms including the age of onset followed a grandfather's pattern to a T. Should have known that I needed to be on it for life. Am now looking for a new doctor.,F,53,20  days150 to 25 1X D,10/2/2014,Imipramine hcl

It was a lovely_ lovely feeling. I felt warm_ secure_ clear-headed_ and serene. No obsessions/compulsions. It was almost like MDMA. And the sleep was heavenly. It did dull the nerve pain_ too. If it weren't for the side effects_ I definitely would have continued the drug. I had torrential diarrhea 2 hours after taking it_ my urine stream was pin-thin_ and I couldn't even get close to orgasm.

10, 1, Overactive bladder,constipation_ terrible morning depression - I could hardly get out of bed,"I was taking  IMIPRAMINE HCL for overactive bladder issues.  Having had depression for a long time I figured it might help since it is also used as an antidepressant.  In preparation for some surgery I stopped taking the  IMIPRAMINE HCL and within a week of stopping it I noticed that I no longer was waking up really depressed and not wanting to get out of bed.

11, 5, Insomnia_ anxiety attacks,I tried weaning myself off 8 weeks ago since I felt it had run its course. Within 3 days I developed tinnitus (ringing in ears) and IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). Two weeks later I was lethargic_ emotional_ irritable and mildly depressed.,By week 5 I had actually resolved the insomnia on my own but my stomach started getting worse and worse each day. I thought I had a urinary tract infection. I was bloated_ constipated_ emotional_ lethargic_ and mildly depressed. I continued to cut the dosage. Even consulted an herbalist and became a vegetarian. I finally got an emergency appointment with my doctor today_ begging for a colonoscopy. Unfortunately_ as I suspected_ she told me to go back on the imipramine and that once I was back to 100 mg all of these physical symptoms would be reversed.Bottom line: as much as I hate being on something like this and I feel it may be toxic in the long term_ I can't live with these side effects_ or apparenly_ without the imipramine. My doctor explained that I will probaby be on it for the rest of my life. I am ambivalent about this diagnosis_ since I feel my anxiety and insomnia issues have been resolved_ however_ my quality of life over the past 8 weeks of going from 100 mg to 25 mg has been horrendous.

Makes me feel calm and relaxed_ and not prone to lose my temper or become frustrated. Stops self-punishing thoughts and repetitive_ anxious rumination. The only side-effect which really makes it hard to take is the dry sinus: my nose and sinuses become very sore_ dry and itchy_ and it drives me mad! May be because I also drink a bit of coffee etc._ but I never noticed this problem before I started this drug.

19, 1, Panic disorder,"I started Imipramine about 6 weeks ago ans began with 25 mg a day for 7 days then upped it to 50 mg for the rest of the duration per doc's orders. After 4 weeks I was getting excited and not the good kind then 5 weeks I had more panic attacks back to back then I ever had before in my life. Then week 6 I wanted to die_ I called my Doc and told them I couldnt leave the house I was so bad I couldnt sleep and I had around a dozen panic attacks per day. Scared me so bad that I really thought I was going to be hospitalized. Luckily I began to taper off 4 days before my emergency visit with the Doc and today Im back in Zoloft_ this time I will deal with the sexual side effects b/c being in panic mode 24/7 is not cool and makes you wish you were dead. Now since Ive been weeing off of Imipramine I have had these terrible headaches but eveyone is different and the reason I was prescribed Imipramine is b/c I ""failed"" about 7 other anti-depressants. But this one is by far the worst I have ever and I mean ever had to deal with. Now with the help of 5mg of Xanax and my zoloft on the rise and EFT techniques and CBT therapy and Faith in God I am just starting to see the light_ also I quit drinking and using tobacco 3 years ago all on my own and that was like taking a piss compared to the Imipramine reaction I experienced. But Im not a D-bag and I know everyone reacts differently to each Anti-depressant so that is just my story with this med.

I also felt hyperaroused (and was misdiagnosed as having PTSD)_ extremely anxious_ could not sleep well while on it_ had adrenaline surges which made me angry for no reason.

I have never had nightmares; I've had bad dreams but I would never have categorized them as nightmares.  In the six weeks I've been taking Imipramine I've woken up almost nightly from the most vivid and tragic dreams drenched in sweat_ out of breath_ thrashing_ and sobbing.  This morning I woke at 1am from a horrible dream to find that I was beating myself in the face and head with my fists.

A GP had prescribed Elavil and Xanax_ but that put me into a drug induced fog. I stopped the Elavil but continued the Xanax.  Another GP told me to stop the Xanax_ so I tried to do so but was unable to.  I then got brave enough to see a psychiatrist who put me on Imipramine (25mg/day) and weened me off the Xanax.  He gradually increased the dosage. It took about 10 weeks_ but all of a sudden the black cloud lifted.  Since then_ i've been at a 250mg maintenance dose.  About 13 years ago_ my doctor tried switching me to Prozac. I gradually stopped he Imipramine while taking 20mg/day of Prozac.  Once the Imipramine was stopped altogether_ I felt like I couldn't sleep and had awful dreams that I would think about all day until I had new ones the following night.  I spiraled back down very quickly. My doctor stopped the Prozac and put me back on Imipramine and ramped me up to 300mg/day.  it took me about 10 months to get back to ""normal"".

Initially he took it for bed-wetting but when I tried to wean him off_ his previous ""melt-downs"" returned.  I had thought this was a stage he was outgrowing.  He had intensive implosive melt-downs prior to going on this drug.  I realized that it was the same drug that cured my father from debilitating long-term depression and put two and two together.  At age 11_ my son stopped taking it cold-turkey without my knowledge.  He suffered two days of nighttime hallucinations--very scary stuff.  After that_ he toyed with going off it again in middle school but decided that the anxiety he felt without it was worse than taking the drug.  He only has dry mouth as a side effect.  He has a really high iq and tests in the 99th percentile so I guess it didn't hurt his brain development.  He does have a small stature and is skinny.  I don't know if the medicine stunted his growth in any way.  I would be interested in any comments from other long-term youth users of this drug to see if they had normal growth.

My resting heart rate increased to 100bpm for the first month and has almost gone back to normal after a couple months of being on Imipramine.  It has been effective in treating the depression_ however the side effects are too terrible to remain on the drug.  The most severe side effect I've experienced is constipation.  I have not been able to go to the bathroom for over two weeks_ even with the use of laxatives_ enimas_ and stool softeners.

Also_ he put me on 4mg of Pherphenazine_ 5 mg of Diazapam_ and 10 mg of Proponolol.

I'm back on imipramine 75 mgs a day and plan to continue as long as necessary-maybe for life.  Dry mouth is a small price to pay for feeling normal.

54, 5, insomnia,morning grogginess,My daughter took this from second grade to fifth grade.  It saved her life.  She had developed a major fear of sleep and by the time I could finally get a doctor to believe me_ the problem had become so acute she had developed night terrors and just this horrible_ horrible sleeplessness.  Anyone who tells you that if a child is tired enough they will just go to sleep has never had a child who is an insomniac.  There may have been some side effects from this medicine but honestly she was so exhausted after months of next to no sleep--certainly no stage 3 or 4 sleep--that any side effects were nothing compared to the benefits.  She was suicidal before_ not from depression but from exhaustion.  Doctors do not recognize the seriousness of sleeplessness_ and certainly not in children.  Patting a kid's hand and leaving the room does not work.  Someone wanted to know how to get off this drug.

I have to spend 2 hours a day at the gym to keep from gaining more.,I take a small dose (25mg) for a nerve disorder (which is exacerbated by stress). I can see that this would be an effective drug for combating stress_ since it greatly helps my nerve disorder_ which had been debilitating. The weight gain has been so annoying that I'd like to ween myself off this medication_ but I don't know if I'll be able to. A side note: I have ADD_ and this does NOTHING to help it.

I went to the Psychiatrist & told him I was having severe mood swings & he suggested Lexapro at 10mg or up to 40 mg of imipramine. I was taking lexapro every other day and the psychologist said it wouldn't work that way plus I started taking 40 mg.of imipramine. When I saw the psychiatrist again he suggested getting off the lexapro because of the possibility of weight gain and it ""stops working after a while"" and increasing the imipramine to 50 mg. He also contradicted the psychologist saying the lexapro would work that way because it stays in your system. I got laid off because work was slow and all I've done for a few days is go on the computer and lay on the couch_ but I don't have the severe mood swings.

A few times I have tried to wean myself (self-imposed) off this medication only for it to back fire in severe anxiety attacks with physical pain.  While taking imipramine_ I feel like myself and normal.  I would much rather take imipramine than an of the newer_ less studied drugs.  I've been able to function normally.  I held a day job for over 20 years with no attendance problems and performing that job in terms ""greatly exceeding standards"".  I'm also on 15 mg of clorazepate (anti-axiety).  I've been on 75 mg of imipramine for many years but now feel that the tearfulness_ chemical taste_ and pin and needles feel on my arms indicate that the depression is still present or may have increased.  I'm looking at increasing the dosage to about 125mg (under doctors care).  I have never abused this drug.  I have no suicidal thoughts and have been treated by my primary care physician.

65, 4, depression,waking up after a few hours.,I was on 25mg of elavil (amitryptaline) and I was having recurring negative mood swings. The psychiatrist gave me 10mg imipramine_ the smallest dose available_ and said I could take up to 3 a day. At first I wasn't that happy with it_ but now that I'm up to 3 a day it seems pretty good. I work 2nd shift and I find that I'm sleeping less on the imipramine which is good because I can get up earlier and get more done during the day. I like the fact that they are only 10mg because if I'm feeling blue at work I can take one without it effecting my performance. I'm beginning to make a habit of that though_ and it may be because I was a substance abuser and the idea of that appeals to someone with an addictive personality.

77, 2, Anxiety_ mild depression,At an initial dose of 50mg/day (in the evening)_ I've had horrible dry mouth (to the point that I nearly choked on a muffin the first week).  I've also had an odd sexual side effect whereby when I ejaculate I feel a strange pressure/dull ache in my groin area.  It's not enough to stop me doing it_ but it's odd and it's somewhat disconcerting.  Contrary to most things I've read_ I've actually had *more* trouble sleeping since I started taking it.,Overall I can't really say that after a month at 50mg/day I can see any effect on anxiety at all_ and absolutely none on depression.  I responded very well at first to Prozac_ but the side effects made me stop it.  I did okay on Effexor until I tried to get off it (evil stuff_ don't use it!)_ and I did very well for depression on Remeron.

I didn't really feel that it was doing anything for my depression_ although it did help me sleep and it decreased the pain associated with my bladder problem.  My medical history is so fuzzy_ though_ that I can't remember if my bladder problem developed after I started taking Imipramine for depression and then it simply helped to regulate the pain once it was in full swing.  I decided two months ago to stop taking my medication (I was at 125 mg a night and now I'm down to 75 mg - I'm taking it slowly!) and I feel so much better.  I was really concerned that I wouldn't be able to sleep once I stopped taking it_ but my sleep has gotten better (it's less difficult for me to fall asleep) and so has my bladder problem.  I feel best about the fact that I no longer feel like an 8 year old girl and that I'm starting to discover my sexuality.  Oh yes_ the dry mouth.

81, 4, PTSD/Anxiety,After trying all the SSRI's and multiple reuptake inhitbors I requested Tofranil PM specifically. I read on this site that others had good luck with this medicine. Unfortunatly I went to my GP instead of my pdoc to get it because I could not get in soon enough with my pdoc. My GP started me out at a dose that was much to high (100mg per night). It wacked my brain so hard that my memory quit working_ I got lost in the middle of sentences when attempting a short interchange_ I lost words that were normally a part of my vocablulary_ I was like...Duh! After one week at 100mg I was able to see my pdoc who reduced my dose to 50mg per night. After one week my mind has cleared_ but now I am easily agitated and fly off the handle at the most minor irritations. I spoke with my pdoc today and he wants me to up my dose to 50mg in the morning and at night for a total dose of 100mg per day. I dont want to mess with taking pills all the time so I am going to try to get a script for 75mg of Tofranil PM and work back up to 100mg. I am having some negative sexual side effects and I cant drink beer anymore_ too bad. (I like German Wheat Beer...Its gooooood!) No sex and No beer is a very good reason to be depressed and anxious.,After I was able to think again the Tofranil/imipramine works well for depression and helps me sleep better. I am still not on the final adjusted dose_ at this point it helps a little with anxiety but not enough. I think it will work well once I am on the correct dose. Starting dose for outpatients should be no more than 50mg per day increasing the dose by 25mg every seven to ten days until reaching the level that is correct for the patient. Even though my pdoc wants me to up my dose by 50mg all at once I dont intend to do that_ not after my first experience. I cant afford to be stupid.,M,50,3  weeks,10/20/2004,Imipramine hcl

Side effects have been very minimal although I was glad to read that a few other people have had some urinary hesitancy_ and that my problem is in fact caused by the imipramine.
