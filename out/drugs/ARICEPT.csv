At 10mg almost instant terrible dreams for mum and constant tearfulness during day too. She has always been prone to have nightmares which left her distressed for days afterwards but it was a few times a year not twice a night!,Mum is going to stop taking it. We will consult with her clinic as to other drugs or maybe return to a lower dose of Aricept. Coconut oil has had no effect after consistent use for 6 months at high doses. I can't see any other options. Pity about Aricept as it did really work.,,79,2  months5mg_ 10mg,5/29/2016,Aricept

6, 1, dementia,Extreme confusion_ not sleeping at night_ sleeping into the afternoon_ refusal to get up in the morning_ not eating_ very repetitive_ worsened memory problems.,My mother was prescribed 5 mg of donepezil which is generic aricept 7 or 9 years ago.  She was fine on it_ driving and functioning normally but forgetful.  Last month she was complaining of being dizzy and tired which are both side effects but I thought she should see a doctor.  Her doctor did a quick memory test which she failed so he increased her dosage to 10mg  After a couple of weeks she began acting strangely and her behavior began to get worse.  She wasn't sleeping at night or getting herself up in the morning.  She started to forget who I am at times and where she is and how she got here.  I had a feeling it might be side effects so I asked the doctor if we can decrease her dosage to 5 mg and he said yes.  The following day she got herself up for the first time in weeks.  She had some confusion during the day but nothing compared to what she was like on 10 mg.  She saw the doctor yesterday and he took her completely off of it.  She still experiences some confusion but she recognizes that it is confusion and it passes.  I am able to leave her alone in the other room for the first time in weeks.  I hope to see more positive changes as her body adjusts to not being on this drug.  These past two weeks have been a nightmare.  I finally feel like I have my mother back with me.,F,75,1  months10 mg 1X D,2/23/2016Email,Aricept

After taking this drug for less than 2 weeks his memory_ confusion_ frustration level significantly worsened.  He had just about stopped swearing at the smallest of problems_ but started doing that again more than ever when frustrated.  He was sleeping most of the day_ no interest in anything;  appetite issues;  had numerous issues handling tasks he could do previously. Couldn't remember things he knew the previous week.

8, 1, Grandmother_ Dementia,Extreme change in mood and behavior_ worsening symptoms of Dementia_ restless insomnia_ hallucinations_ weakness_ fatigue,This drug is not for everyone.  As caregivers for my 88 year old grandmother with Dementia_ the past 2 months have been an absolute nightmare for my mother and I.  Grandmother was initially on 5mg/day and two weeks ago the dosage was increased to 10 mg/day.  Within a week of taking 5mg/day_ she began exhibiting a sharp mental and emotional decline. Within 3 days of switching to 10mg daily_ my grandmother's Dementia started to become much_ much worse and only worsened over time (she has been on 10mg for 2 weeks). Examples: Swearing (which she has never_ ever done in my lifetime)_ combativeness_ refusing vital meds_ hallucinations (sounds_ events_ visual)_ crying_ anger_ mood swings_ physical hostility_ extreme fluctuations in body temperature_ extreme insomnia (averaging 3 hours each night)_ roaming the house all night & talking incoherently as she walks_ agitation_ excessive rapid talking (for hours at a time to imaginary people)_ speaking incoherently and forgetting who family members are.  I cannot understate how hellish this has been for all of us. We are reducing her dosage back to 5mg daily and then we will be taking her OFF OF THIS MEDICATION. Her symptoms and behavior were nothing like this before she began taking Aricept. The timing of her decline correlates to when she began taking the Aricept and the subsequent increase in dosage.,F,88,2  months5mg 2X D,1/4/2016,Aricept

I've just woken up from the final dosage I'll ever take_ soaked in sweat_ & having to yell out loud to break away from sleep paralysis. Bad dreams started from the first time I took the drug. It was immediately apparent that the Aricept was the problem_ because the dreams were so awful & vivid--I could remember every single thing_ & that has gotten less common as I've gotten older; only after I took the Aricept did my bad dreams start. (I am 63.) I really tried to give the drug a chance_ but am TOO THROUGH. I just woke up from dreaming_ for the second time since I took the drug_ that a man was trying to rape me. I could feel his hot breath & the heat coming from his body. I don't dream things like this or watch horror movies. This morning I was able to finally wrench myself from the paralysis_ & the almost total blindness that was in my dream was gone too. I had kept trying to move my hand to get what was impeding my vision to LEAVE_ but I could only see what was in the middle of my field of vision_ & there was a jagged blackness all around that_ & I was unable to move my hand for what seemed like forever. Every night since I went on Aricept I have had varying degrees of nightmares_ but wanted to give the medication a chance. NO MORE.I don't think I have Alzheimer's AT ALL. I think I have been drugged into all of the symptoms. I am gradually stopping ALL psychotr,F,63, 10 mg. 1X D,6/27/2015Email,Aricept

After 3 months we stopped the drug without informing the doctor as we  knew that it was the Aricept  causing all the  unwanted side effects as dads health had been excellent up until this point..We also stopped the statins which dad had been on for years as we found out that they can cause memory issues..Dad had no history of heart problems & there was no reason why he should take them....We also found out that Aricept over-stimulates the para sympathetic side of the nervous system which affects the glands and excretions of the body hence the eye-watering_the runny-nose_stomach excretions_incontinence etc....After 6 or 7 weeks of stopping Aricept  luckily the symptoms finaly went away and now dad is much happier and relaxed...I would warn anyone who is going to take this drug to think very carefully indeed as it is incredible how it can change people for the worst!,,77,90  days10mg 1X D,5/11/2015Email,Aricept

38, 1, poor short term memory_,This drug was prescribed to my 83 year old mother. We did not know that she was suffering from dimentia caused by slight strokes. The medicine caused her to loose control of her bowel and her apathy and ability to comunicate declined. She died of a heart attack 6 months after starting this drug. Very sudden death and we did know she had heart problems. She had begun seeing a geriatric speacilist who prescribed this medicine.,This is a very dangerous drug. I would rather know mama died of natural causes but I know this drug causes heart attacks in people with vascular dimentia. I would rather be safe than sorry.

40, 2, Brain atrophy and dementia,Panic attacks_ delusions_ confusion_ anger and being irrational,My 76 year old mother was on 5 mg Aricept for a few years and at first seemed ok but I didn't notice that it helped her memory much. Dr. recommended upping it to 10mg. After 8 months or so my sweet docile mother began to become angry and irrational. She was always mean and hateful to me (her only daughter and caregiver).  Everyone around us noticed the change. Some were very concerned since she would become very hostile. I took her off of it after reading some of these side affects.  She became her sweet self again but I worried about her memory loss so I spoke w/her Dr who said maybe 10 mg was too much and go back to 5 mg again. Well after 3 months on 5 mg she is becoming worse than before.  She threatens to hit me and yells at me constantly. Accuses me of lying to her and scheming but can never explain why - just says you know what you did. There is no talking to her when she is in this state. She has spells where she thinks I am her sister and she is living at the home where she was a young adult. I cannot convince her otherwise and trying to tell her different makes her very upset.  the spells only last a short time then she remembers me again.  Dr. still insists Aricept shouldn't do that but has agreed to try something else if I want.  I took her off the Aricept yesterday and we will see if the behavior improves again.  I hope the Aricept hasn't done any permanent damage.  Afraid to try any of the other memory drugs for fear of more side effects. I will check this site t,F,76,3  years5mg 1X D,1/31/2012Email,Aricept

His short term memory started to deteriorate.  4 months ago our GP prescribed 5MG Aricept.  Dad started sleeping alot more_ like to be on his own_ very withdrawn_ personality changed and shuffles around very slowly_ happy to sit in a different room to everyone else either sleeping or just staring at the wall. His concentration is very bad and if he is part of a conversation he hears completely different things to what is being said. He's had a sudden drop in weight loss (although good appetite).  He went to a memory clinic 4 weeks ago_ Aricept was increased to 10MG.  I really think this caused further disastrous side effects. My dad is now sleeping so much it is unhealthy. He's had arguments with my mum calling her names (totally not like him) and giving her an ultimatum to leave him alone or she can leave the house.  My mum feels scared of him for the first time ever. I searched for side effects from Aricept am so shocked to see the stories from others on the website and I could relate so many of these side effects to my dad. I am going to make sure that my dad goes back to 5MG Aricept and then stop it completely. I feel like we are losing our dad very quickly (more so since the increase).

Because she was also unable to deal with her bathroom issues herself_ the diarrhea caused numerous serious infections and also resulted in the breakdown of skin tissue on her bottom which caused an ongoing burning sensation.

My mother had no side effects until 2011 and I was told it was the disease progressing. The medication has ""bought"" my mother and our family several years of valuable time together. We are just now beginning to see this mean disease begin to progress. When we saw the aggressive behavior begin_ we placed Mom on Abilify. I know_ it has side effects and a black box warning that it can cause death in the elderly. My doctor explained that there are two age groups of studies done on this medication. One is that of young people approximately 25 to 35 and an other one done on older adults_ thus causing more side effects due to heart and health issues. My mother has done very well on this med and the aggressive behavior is completely gone. She takes it with nightly medications. I guess I am wondering if the aricapt and namenda will keep her in this ""limbo"" stage for years or should we expect it to progress soon?

Within a week I found my memory retention was inproving and I had no ill side effects. I figured that if the bad side effects could be evident within 1 day that my week of good effects could certainly be possible.  I have always had a gift for remembering numbers.

My mom is 60 started taking this poison about 3 years ago_ immediately noticed an increase in hallucinations and agressive behaviors_ anorexia_ tremors_ etc. Mom has been in a nursing home the last 6 months and her disease has made her decline rapidly. These medications are A HUGE EXPENSE_ my family would like her off of them but each time it is brought up we are guilted into continuing them_ ""you don't know what they are preventing"" It has not been my experience that this medication has helped with anything.",,F,60,3  years30 2X D,4/18/2011Email,Aricept
48, 3, cognitive decline,I am a counselor and work with elderly adults who take Aricept on a weekly basis.  I work with one gentleman who was having some behavioral difficulties while taking it.  He also had behavioral difficulties before taking it.  His physician held his Aricept for 7 days and behavior improved.  It was therefore discontinued.,It's important to consider that this man also began eating more (adequate amounts) during this time_ per his wife's report.  This may have been a confounding factor.  Furthermore_ I've talked to family members who are dissatisfied that Aricept does not improve memory/cognitive status.  Current research however_ indicates Aricept does NOT normally improve memory performance.  Aricept DOES_ however_ delay the advancement of cognitive decline caused by Alzheimer's Dementia and some other forms of dementia.  I have been told overwhelmingly that while family members don't notice Aricept IMPROVING cognitive performance_ they DO notice that their loved ones decline much quicker once they discontinue use of Aricept.  This makes sense_ because it is very consistent with current research findings.  It's also important to know that physicians don't always tell patients about behavioral side effects of Aricept because they are pretty unusual.  In most cases I've seen_ benefits outweigh the side effects experienced from Aricept use.  It's also important to note that people who are offering things like Xanax_ Klonopin_ Valium_ and/or Ativan for depressed mood are offering the wrong medicine for the wrong symptom.  Xanax and the others are called benzodiazapines and are primarily intended for treatment of anxiety (nervousness)_ not depression.  They can also make people groggy and elderly people are more sensitive to medications in general.  If your loved one is taking a benzodiazapine and,M,29, 10 mg 1X D,3/24/2011Email,Aricept

57, 1, mild dementia,My 81 year old mother_ who I really love_ is always up at 8 a.m. to eat her cereal and watch TV_ every morning_ and she goes on walks up the street several times per day.  She was prescribed Aricept 10 mg. and took her first dose at 7:45 p.m. on 1/1/2011.  Since Sunday morning she has been having very severe side effects.  Labored breathing_ loose bowels--not stool_ profuse sweating_ and she has been so tired she cannot open her eyes for more than a couple of seconds.  She had the pill at 7:45 pm on Saturday January 1 before bed and now she is still sleeping and sweating profusely and cannot walk.  I can tell she is dreaming as she is talking in her sleep and reaching for something.  Other side effects slurred speech_ disoriented as to where she is_ and what she should do next.,This drug is VERY VERY strong and I would recommend to never give an 81 year old 10 mg dose initially.  Wish my mom luck to wake up soon please.,F,81,1  days10 mg 1X D,1/4/2011,Aricept
58, 1, mid to latent alzheimer's,Gradual increase in rate_ intensity and frequency of the following: irritability_ irrational throughts_ violent outbursts_ argumentative_ chronic EXPLOSIVE diarrhea_ insomnia_ fatigue_ nightmares (he reports never remembering a dream in his life prior to taking medication)_ loss of appetite_ childish mood swings_ apathy_ no understanding of hygiene (was meticulous about hygiene prior to taking),"I am writing this for my dad who is 75 years old. He was diagnosed with alzheimer's 3.5 years ago. His functional abilities were limited_ at best. He suffered from five mini strokes within the same time frame. My dad has always been irrational and explosive_ never cared to know the date or time of day_ and when asked about who is president_ has answered incorrectly his entire life. His physician diagnosed and prescribed based on questions like this. 5mg aricept for two weeks_ then to 10mg--he has taken now for 3.5 years.  He was also prescribed Namenda_ Zoloft_ and plavix.  I thought this combination of meds was miraculous until the past six months. Prior to diagnosis_ his behavior was severely explosive_ hallucinating_ ""sundowners""_ and essentially could not dress himself or get out of his chair. Immediately upon taking the meds_ he appeared to regain 70% of his functionality_ began to be involved in life again. For the past six months (and more likely_ gradually upon taking med)_ mood swings are more frequent_ irrational-bordering violent-extremely irritable/argumentative_ complains about everything (frequent complaints were characteristic of him_ but this is unbearable)_basically hates life and everything about it_ AND has chronic_EXPLOSIVE episodes of diarrhea-usually not making it to the bathroom.As his primary caregiver_ and after reading these comments_ we are DCing the aricept tonight.I will re-post the results of this trial within one week.I deperately hope",M,75,3.5  years5-10mg 1X D,12/4/2010,Aricept
59, 2, Alzheimers,Hallucinations,My mother is 96 and has late stage. Her behavior is usually terrible. About a month ago her perscription ran out. Since her doctor was moving and I'd heard it really doesn't help late stage patients_ I skipped it for a couple months. She's been back on it 4 days now and is having very strong hallucinations again and has been doing this for around 8 hours now. I just realized this wasn't nearly as bad during the period when she was off the drug. I am wondering if the last 4 years of her life have been made even more miserable because of it and also why I was never warned about side effects. Does it somehow counter-act the Namenda she takes to calm her down?,M,60,4  years5 1X D,11/25/2010Email,Aricept
