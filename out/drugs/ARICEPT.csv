At 10mg almost instant terrible dreams for mum and constant tearfulness during day too. She has always been prone to have nightmares which left her distressed for days afterwards but it was a few times a year not twice a night!,Mum is going to stop taking it. We will consult with her clinic as to other drugs or maybe return to a lower dose of Aricept. Coconut oil has had no effect after consistent use for 6 months at high doses. I can't see any other options. Pity about Aricept as it did really work.,,79,2  months5mg_ 10mg,5/29/2016,Aricept

6, 1, dementia,Extreme confusion_ not sleeping at night_ sleeping into the afternoon_ refusal to get up in the morning_ not eating_ very repetitive_ worsened memory problems.,My mother was prescribed 5 mg of donepezil which is generic aricept 7 or 9 years ago.  She was fine on it_ driving and functioning normally but forgetful.  Last month she was complaining of being dizzy and tired which are both side effects but I thought she should see a doctor.  Her doctor did a quick memory test which she failed so he increased her dosage to 10mg  After a couple of weeks she began acting strangely and her behavior began to get worse.  She wasn't sleeping at night or getting herself up in the morning.  She started to forget who I am at times and where she is and how she got here.  I had a feeling it might be side effects so I asked the doctor if we can decrease her dosage to 5 mg and he said yes.  The following day she got herself up for the first time in weeks.  She had some confusion during the day but nothing compared to what she was like on 10 mg.  She saw the doctor yesterday and he took her completely off of it.  She still experiences some confusion but she recognizes that it is confusion and it passes.  I am able to leave her alone in the other room for the first time in weeks.  I hope to see more positive changes as her body adjusts to not being on this drug.  These past two weeks have been a nightmare.  I finally feel like I have my mother back with me.,F,75,1  months10 mg 1X D,2/23/2016Email,Aricept

After taking this drug for less than 2 weeks his memory_ confusion_ frustration level significantly worsened.  He had just about stopped swearing at the smallest of problems_ but started doing that again more than ever when frustrated.  He was sleeping most of the day_ no interest in anything;  appetite issues;  had numerous issues handling tasks he could do previously. Couldn't remember things he knew the previous week.

8, 1, Grandmother_ Dementia,Extreme change in mood and behavior_ worsening symptoms of Dementia_ restless insomnia_ hallucinations_ weakness_ fatigue,This drug is not for everyone.  As caregivers for my 88 year old grandmother with Dementia_ the past 2 months have been an absolute nightmare for my mother and I.  Grandmother was initially on 5mg/day and two weeks ago the dosage was increased to 10 mg/day.  Within a week of taking 5mg/day_ she began exhibiting a sharp mental and emotional decline. Within 3 days of switching to 10mg daily_ my grandmother's Dementia started to become much_ much worse and only worsened over time (she has been on 10mg for 2 weeks). Examples: Swearing (which she has never_ ever done in my lifetime)_ combativeness_ refusing vital meds_ hallucinations (sounds_ events_ visual)_ crying_ anger_ mood swings_ physical hostility_ extreme fluctuations in body temperature_ extreme insomnia (averaging 3 hours each night)_ roaming the house all night & talking incoherently as she walks_ agitation_ excessive rapid talking (for hours at a time to imaginary people)_ speaking incoherently and forgetting who family members are.  I cannot understate how hellish this has been for all of us. We are reducing her dosage back to 5mg daily and then we will be taking her OFF OF THIS MEDICATION. Her symptoms and behavior were nothing like this before she began taking Aricept. The timing of her decline correlates to when she began taking the Aricept and the subsequent increase in dosage.,F,88,2  months5mg 2X D,1/4/2016,Aricept

I've just woken up from the final dosage I'll ever take_ soaked in sweat_ & having to yell out loud to break away from sleep paralysis. Bad dreams started from the first time I took the drug. It was immediately apparent that the Aricept was the problem_ because the dreams were so awful & vivid--I could remember every single thing_ & that has gotten less common as I've gotten older; only after I took the Aricept did my bad dreams start. (I am 63.) I really tried to give the drug a chance_ but am TOO THROUGH. I just woke up from dreaming_ for the second time since I took the drug_ that a man was trying to rape me. I could feel his hot breath & the heat coming from his body. I don't dream things like this or watch horror movies. This morning I was able to finally wrench myself from the paralysis_ & the almost total blindness that was in my dream was gone too. I had kept trying to move my hand to get what was impeding my vision to LEAVE_ but I could only see what was in the middle of my field of vision_ & there was a jagged blackness all around that_ & I was unable to move my hand for what seemed like forever. Every night since I went on Aricept I have had varying degrees of nightmares_ but wanted to give the medication a chance. NO MORE.I don't think I have Alzheimer's AT ALL. I think I have been drugged into all of the symptoms. I am gradually stopping ALL psychotr,F,63, 10 mg. 1X D,6/27/2015Email,Aricept

After 3 months we stopped the drug without informing the doctor as we  knew that it was the Aricept  causing all the  unwanted side effects as dads health had been excellent up until this point..We also stopped the statins which dad had been on for years as we found out that they can cause memory issues..Dad had no history of heart problems & there was no reason why he should take them....We also found out that Aricept over-stimulates the para sympathetic side of the nervous system which affects the glands and excretions of the body hence the eye-watering_the runny-nose_stomach excretions_incontinence etc....After 6 or 7 weeks of stopping Aricept  luckily the symptoms finaly went away and now dad is much happier and relaxed...I would warn anyone who is going to take this drug to think very carefully indeed as it is incredible how it can change people for the worst!,,77,90  days10mg 1X D,5/11/2015Email,Aricept

38, 1, poor short term memory_,This drug was prescribed to my 83 year old mother. We did not know that she was suffering from dimentia caused by slight strokes. The medicine caused her to loose control of her bowel and her apathy and ability to comunicate declined. She died of a heart attack 6 months after starting this drug. Very sudden death and we did know she had heart problems. She had begun seeing a geriatric speacilist who prescribed this medicine.,This is a very dangerous drug. I would rather know mama died of natural causes but I know this drug causes heart attacks in people with vascular dimentia. I would rather be safe than sorry.

40, 2, Brain atrophy and dementia,Panic attacks_ delusions_ confusion_ anger and being irrational,My 76 year old mother was on 5 mg Aricept for a few years and at first seemed ok but I didn't notice that it helped her memory much. Dr. recommended upping it to 10mg. After 8 months or so my sweet docile mother began to become angry and irrational. She was always mean and hateful to me (her only daughter and caregiver).  Everyone around us noticed the change. Some were very concerned since she would become very hostile. I took her off of it after reading some of these side affects.  She became her sweet self again but I worried about her memory loss so I spoke w/her Dr who said maybe 10 mg was too much and go back to 5 mg again. Well after 3 months on 5 mg she is becoming worse than before.  She threatens to hit me and yells at me constantly. Accuses me of lying to her and scheming but can never explain why - just says you know what you did. There is no talking to her when she is in this state. She has spells where she thinks I am her sister and she is living at the home where she was a young adult. I cannot convince her otherwise and trying to tell her different makes her very upset.  the spells only last a short time then she remembers me again.  Dr. still insists Aricept shouldn't do that but has agreed to try something else if I want.  I took her off the Aricept yesterday and we will see if the behavior improves again.  I hope the Aricept hasn't done any permanent damage.  Afraid to try any of the other memory drugs for fear of more side effects. I will check this site t,F,76,3  years5mg 1X D,1/31/2012Email,Aricept

His short term memory started to deteriorate.  4 months ago our GP prescribed 5MG Aricept.  Dad started sleeping alot more_ like to be on his own_ very withdrawn_ personality changed and shuffles around very slowly_ happy to sit in a different room to everyone else either sleeping or just staring at the wall. His concentration is very bad and if he is part of a conversation he hears completely different things to what is being said. He's had a sudden drop in weight loss (although good appetite).  He went to a memory clinic 4 weeks ago_ Aricept was increased to 10MG.  I really think this caused further disastrous side effects. My dad is now sleeping so much it is unhealthy. He's had arguments with my mum calling her names (totally not like him) and giving her an ultimatum to leave him alone or she can leave the house.  My mum feels scared of him for the first time ever. I searched for side effects from Aricept am so shocked to see the stories from others on the website and I could relate so many of these side effects to my dad. I am going to make sure that my dad goes back to 5MG Aricept and then stop it completely. I feel like we are losing our dad very quickly (more so since the increase).

Because she was also unable to deal with her bathroom issues herself_ the diarrhea caused numerous serious infections and also resulted in the breakdown of skin tissue on her bottom which caused an ongoing burning sensation.

My mother had no side effects until 2011 and I was told it was the disease progressing. The medication has ""bought"" my mother and our family several years of valuable time together. We are just now beginning to see this mean disease begin to progress. When we saw the aggressive behavior begin_ we placed Mom on Abilify. I know_ it has side effects and a black box warning that it can cause death in the elderly. My doctor explained that there are two age groups of studies done on this medication. One is that of young people approximately 25 to 35 and an other one done on older adults_ thus causing more side effects due to heart and health issues. My mother has done very well on this med and the aggressive behavior is completely gone. She takes it with nightly medications. I guess I am wondering if the aricapt and namenda will keep her in this ""limbo"" stage for years or should we expect it to progress soon?

Within a week I found my memory retention was inproving and I had no ill side effects. I figured that if the bad side effects could be evident within 1 day that my week of good effects could certainly be possible.  I have always had a gift for remembering numbers.

48, 3, cognitive decline,I am a counselor and work with elderly adults who take Aricept on a weekly basis.  I work with one gentleman who was having some behavioral difficulties while taking it.  He also had behavioral difficulties before taking it.  His physician held his Aricept for 7 days and behavior improved.  It was therefore discontinued.,It's important to consider that this man also began eating more (adequate amounts) during this time_ per his wife's report.  This may have been a confounding factor.  Furthermore_ I've talked to family members who are dissatisfied that Aricept does not improve memory/cognitive status.  Current research however_ indicates Aricept does NOT normally improve memory performance.  Aricept DOES_ however_ delay the advancement of cognitive decline caused by Alzheimer's Dementia and some other forms of dementia.  I have been told overwhelmingly that while family members don't notice Aricept IMPROVING cognitive performance_ they DO notice that their loved ones decline much quicker once they discontinue use of Aricept.  This makes sense_ because it is very consistent with current research findings.  It's also important to know that physicians don't always tell patients about behavioral side effects of Aricept because they are pretty unusual.  In most cases I've seen_ benefits outweigh the side effects experienced from Aricept use.  It's also important to note that people who are offering things like Xanax_ Klonopin_ Valium_ and/or Ativan for depressed mood are offering the wrong medicine for the wrong symptom.  Xanax and the others are called benzodiazapines and are primarily intended for treatment of anxiety (nervousness)_ not depression.  They can also make people groggy and elderly people are more sensitive to medications in general.  If your loved one is taking a benzodiazapine and,M,29, 10 mg 1X D,3/24/2011Email,Aricept

Luckily a family member checks on him several times a day and he was treated at the hospital but the side effects have left him feeling ill and severely depressed.

83, 4, Alzheimers,Am writing on behalf of my father who was diagnosed with Alzheimers in January 2005.  He had been having memory loss problems for a while before being diagnosed and we suspected he may have it for a while before being diagnosed_ but he put it down to stopping work as he had been self-employed and used to being busy.  He started withdrawing from life as he knew it_ refusing to go out_ not wanting to converse or socialize with anyone_ including his own family.  He seemed to be in a depression and had no real interest in life any longer.,He was started on Aricept 5mg increased to 10mg after a year.  We saw an immediate change FOR THE BETTER in him.  He regained all his prior interests in life_ was far more chatty and happy in himself than he'd been for a very long while.  It was as if he'd been lifted out of himself and we were extremely pleased with the good result of this drug.  He's just been to the memory clinic for his 6-monthly check up and he didn't score very well_ so they now want to withdraw it as they say it isn't doing any good_ but we don't want it to be stopped. He went into permanent residential care last month.  We lost my mum last year and I was his carer until then.  We decided to put him into care because he's no longer safe in his own home (for a variety of reasons_ all linked to his Alz).  At the care home he helps do simple chores and at my house he still peels vegetables and can make a drink for himself_ with step-by-step instructions.  We're really afraid that if he comes off Aricept he'll lose what precious little skills he has left_ so we're fighting to keep him on it.  We live in the UK and it's paid for by our National Health Service and is therefore free to him but I know it is an expensive drug. He isn't on any other medication as he has excellent health in every other way. We believe that everything my father can still do is thanks to Aricept and personally I would advise anybody to try it.  I know it isn't for everyone_ but it has definitely worked for him.,M,79,4  years,11/30/2009,Aricept

She sleeps more than she used to_ in the middle of the day even.  But all the comments I see the severe side effects started right away. Her's are all coming on slowly.

90, 1, my father did; 88 years old,He was prescribed aricept to manage Alzeimer's. He died by gasping for air (he could not breath; he died in my hands taking a breath every 10 seconds until he stopped breathing).,My father was not in great shape but we had no reason to expect him to die. When he started taking aricept_ he also started sleeping more. After one week we rushed him to the hospital because he could not breath. There he recovered soon (now I imagine because Aricept was stopped). We brought him back and he started aricept again following the doctor's orders. He died after a week. My father always had low blood pressure_ and I would imagine bradycardia as well. I am afraid that aricept stopped his heart from beating (possibly by increasing the levels of acetylcholine). If only I had checked earlier the side effects of this drug on the internet.,F,88,2  weeks,10/15/2009,Aricept

Doctor gave Aricept and after three days I saw she was acting worse. She was going around in circles with her wheelchair and complaining more about everything. Nighttime was the worst. I was unhappy with this drug and I took her off. On the day she did not receive the dose_ she is clear headed and can talk_ walk and more like herself. I threw them in the trash. She won't be taking it again ever.,I heard this medication would help the effects of Dementia. On TV_ it is advertised as something great. They show that the patient regains their momentum in life again. These drugs are a lie and the poor old people are guinea pigs for the doctors.

The emergency room staff ran every test imaginable.  There was nothing that could account for the sudden and serious memory loss except the introduction of aricept.  24 hours later - having skipped this morning's dose_ I am slowly getting my mother back - this was very frightening and I think it should be listed as a posslible - though perhaps rare - side effect.",,F,78,2  days,4/25/2009,Aricept

Short-term memory gone; various cognitive and perceptual confusions; very insecure and anxious_ with panic attacks etc. Alzheimer's eventually diagnosed and Aricept prescribed. I had a lot of misgivings and concerns about her starting it after reading other people's reports and side effects on this and other sites. However so far_ after 2 months_ the improvement has been fantastic! I noticed an almost immediate improvement starting in some memory function after 2-3 days on the 5mgs dose_ and now after the first month on the 10mgs dose_ further improvement again_ beyond my best hopes; Mum is managing at home again_ with carer visits; remembering much more information and events etc_ more reliable congitive functioning in all ways_ and best of all_ her anxiety state has gone_ and she is confidently Spring cleaning after being able to do/initiate very little just a month or so ago! Possibly current energy and activity is a bit 'over the top' relative to Mum's 'normal'_ and of course we don't know for sure what the coming weeks and moths will bring.

115, 1, Alzheimer's,My mother was diagnosed with Alheimer's soon after a poor recovery from knee replacement surgery. The diagnosis was early stage and mild and immediately put on Aricept. In my opinion_ that's when the decline began rapidly. My mother died last August after a two week severe decline. Sleeping most of 24 hrs of a day. Believing that dehydration was making her so sick in the last week_ she was taken to the ER. She had developed ulcers of the esophagus and seriously in the stomach. She had never had any ulcer or stomach problems in her life. She developed sepsis and died. I strongly believe that the side effect of ulcers was not monitered closely. Beware.

129, 1, dementia,This is referring to my 89 year old aunt in a nursing home.  She was put on aricept to help her memory.  IT IS A HORRIBLE DRUG!!!!  Shortly after she began taking it_ she started having nightmares_ hallucinations_ difficulty walking and thought she was losing her mind.  She was anxious_ parnoid_ depressed and nasty!,We had to INSIST the aricept be discontinued.  Why can't we just accept that old people forget things?  Modern medicine tries to make people young again and many times the cure is worse than the ailment.  After fighting with the staff_ my aunt stopped taking aricept and returned to being a pleasant_ secure_ old lady.,F,89,30  days,12/19/2008,Aricept

She only took it about five days but stopped because the discomfort was too much.,F,80,5  days,11/19/2008,Aricept
132, 3, Memory Loss - Chiropractic Stoke,"My mom (83)is trying Aricept and I noticed a slight improvement in her alertness and memory in about 3 weeks.  She has bad macular degeneration and she started talking about ""seeing"" strange things like lots of people with bulby noses all dressed alike (she knew they weren't there but couldn't get it out of her head.)  She also has been tossing and turning and talking in her sleep.  No diarrhea but maybe a little loss of appetite.  Always so sweet but gets a little agitated at times lately.  I am halfway wanting her to try to keep using it for awhile but after reading all this not so sure.  She does seem better but also is having mild side affects I think.  She is very concerned (anxious) for lack of a better word what I started calling hallucinations.  She isn't confused or out of her mind as she knows it isn't real but afraid she is going to see it again. She is quite frightened.  Does this sound familiar to anyone?

After first day of medicine she looked angry and depressed.After the second day of medicine_she looked awful and informed me she had nauseas_ vomiting and bad problems with stomach functioning.,I had pleaded her doctor for a medicine to help slow down her memory loss. Dr. prescribed Aricept 10 mg pills The result was BAD..BAD BAD This medicine should not be on the market as it is dangerous and harmful. I stopped it_ and prefer to deal with wife weak memory_ but healthy of spirit and happy. Medicine is very expensive and it really hurt my pocket. I had to throw away 98% of medicine. I don't blame her doctor but the Food and Drug Admin.

134, 1, Vascular dementia caused by TIA's,I am submitting this for my mother. My mom is 95 and in a nursing home.  She suffers from TIA's or Transient Istemic Attacks which have been described to us as mini strokes.  Eventually_ she has had so many that she has lost many brain cells and suffers from what is called Vascular Dementia. The first time she was given Aricept_ we noticed that she could no longer use the walker_ and then after about 30 days became manic so they gave her Haldol (sp).  We asked them to take her off both of these and she returned to being able to do the walker and even negotiate stairs and the toilet.  The doctor put her back on it without our consent or knowledge and she again became weak and got to the point she could not even lift a fork.  I went on-line and discovered that Aricept has even caused death in people with vascular dementia.  If you or your elderly parent suffer from TIA's DO NOT allow a doctor to prescribe this.,,F,95,30  days,9/8/2008Email,Aricept

The process of regaining my memory of childhood details is miraculous.  Aricept has doubled my reading speed_ increased my ability to use vocabulary_ and enabled me to organize my thoughts much more quickly.  It has practically tripled my reflexes.  I can catch falling items in mid-air instantly and reflexively.  Every day_ my memory gets better and I've only been taking it a little over a week.  I can jump from image to image from 40 years ago as if the events occurred yesterday_ and these are thoughts and images I hadn't seen or remembered in over 40 years--all back for the first time since then as a result of aricept.

We now have taken her off of Aricept and hopefully she will be on the road to recovery.  I would not recommend taking this drug at all considering the possible side effectS.  Her memory was failing before Aricept_ but she was at least alert and able to function normally. With Aricept her memory was even worse and she is completely unable to function or even walk without almost falling.

138, 1, Alzheimer's,Gradual increase in the following: Difficulty walking_ unsteadiness_ nighttime sleeplessness_ vision problems_ very limited ability to speak intelligibly_ disturbing dreams leading to distress or anger_ talking jibberish_ hallucinated conversation between self and imagined other--often to self in mirror-- leading to episodes of rage and violent behavior.,I am writing in behalf of my wife. I am her sole caregiver.She has been taking one 5 mg Aricept before bedtime for a minimum of 5 years_ perhaps longer. She takes no other prescription drugs but does take DR. Sears' Omega RX fish oil_ which I find to be helpful.  The listed symptoms did not appear at once but gradually increased over a long period of time. It is difficult to identify SOME_ but not all_ of these symptoms as being exclusively side effects of Aricept_ as distinguished from later stage effects of Alzheimer's itself.  However_ I have no no doubt about the most troubling ones_ especially the episodes of extreme anxiety_ anger _ and violence that became certain to appear shortly after bedtime and often lasted for many hours.  These are definitely the result of her taking the Aricept.  Why?  Because I saw an immediate reduction in these symptoms within 24 hours_ a complete cessation after 2-3 days_ and after six days of my discontinuing Aricept_ those synmptoms of high anxiety,F,63,5  years,8/18/2008Email,Aricept

Stopped moving around_ his body seemed stiff.  Had no facial expression or life in his eyes.,We stopped the Aricept 2 weeks ago and the results have been amazing!  It is like my father has come back from the dead!  He talks_ gets up on his own and initiates activity.  I can only compare it to a coma that he has been in for 2 years and has finally woken from.  He looks and acts alert.  Some of the family came to visit and were delighted that he carried on a conversation with them because last time they saw him he sat in a chair with no expression and no verbal communication. I never realized the stupor he was in was due to the Aricept.  Ironically_ his memory is better since he stopped this drug!  I will never put my dad back on Aricept.,M,82,2  years,7/26/2008,Aricept

With Aricept_ she changed into a screaming lunatic!!! She screamed at her room-mate. She dragged all of her belongings down to the lobby and told the staff that her family was picking her up - we knew nothing about it until the staff called us. She talked about going down to the river and throwing herself in. She was a total NUTCASE!!! Everyone in the building saw the change.

She took it for 3 days until I figured out that introducing Aricet was the problem.  I don't know what would have happened to her if I hadn't been with her.  She also became totally disoriented_ confused_ and made little sense verbally.  She didnt' know how she'd gotten to her own home_ and said so many random things that made no sense whatsoever.  It broke my heart to see her so sick.  The NAUSEA was the worst if I had to pick just one.  I took her off Aricept after just 3 days_ and she is slowly trying to recover.  Just the worst experience one could have.  FLUSH THIS DRUG_ and tell the Dr to stick it.,"FYI the Dr said the only ""side effect""' might be loose stool.  WRONG.

Has anyone else had something like this happen to them?  and if so and if they quite taking the meds did they come back around?,,F,85,13  days,1/8/2007Email,Aricept
175, 2, Alzheimer's,My Mom experienced restless sleep_ punctuated by vivid_ disturbing dreams - lots of talking in her sleep.  No significant improvement in her Alzheimer's symptoms.,After taking Aricept for ~2 years_ my Mom went off it and I noticed a definite improvement in her overall level of alertness.

179, 2, Alzheimers or Dementia,My mom became extremely anorexic in just 1-2 months. It is painful to see her bones protruding through her skin.

180, 2, Dementia,I am completing this for my mother: she had very frightening delusions after one dose of Aricept 5mg. She had no delusions before taking Aricept. We persevered with the Aricept for 3 months and the delusions continued throughout the 3 months so I have asked the psychiatrist to withdraw this medication.,There was no appreciable benefit at all. Mother has vascular dementia_ not Alzheimers disease and so perhaps Aricept is not helpful in this condition.,F,78,72  days,4/27/2006,Aricept

182, 5, Alzheimers,Diarrhea. When going to the toilet it comes out in an explosive manner. Disconcerting. Does anyone know how to counteract the diarrhea?,This drug has slowed down the disease dramatically and given a higher quality of life. Everyone who has Alzheimers should have the option to have this drug (assuming no complications with other medication or health problems). In UK the government are against giving it because of the cost - that is cruel to the patient and relatives.,M,77,2  years,5/16/2005,Aricept
