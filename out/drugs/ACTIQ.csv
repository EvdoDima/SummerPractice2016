2, 3, Degenerate disc disease-cervical,Same side effects such as constipation like with all other opioid pain medications,"After reading so many reviews on this medication I'm seriously afraid of losing my teeth because of the high sugar content and the way in which to take this medication. I was prescribed Subsys-a Fentanyl sublingual spray for the past 3 years (this contains alcohol instead of sugar) but my insurance company increased the monthly cost from $20 to $47 per prescription. I simply couldn't afford it and decided to try the generic version of Actiq (Fentanyl citrate) as a substitute because it only costs me $8 a month. After reading all the horrible reviews of almost every patient losing all their teeth_ I'm wondering if paying the extra money per month is better than the thousands of dollars I'll eventually need for dental repair/replacement of my as of now ""health teeth?"" I'm so young and I care about my teeth_ should I stop taking the lollipops and switch back to the more expensive Fentanyl sublingual spray (Subsys)? I've even called my dentist asking what his opinion is and if brushing_ flossing and using an anti-cavity mouthwash after using the lollipops would that help fight the decay? Also I want to note that I only use these 2-3 days a week and go through about 30 in a 6-8 week period and I've noticed most of these patient reviews they are using these 3-4 times a day. Please let me know what your advice is or your personal thoughts. Please don't spam me. Thank you in advance for your time. I'll accept and reply to emails from patients_ doctors and/or dentists.",F,31,1  weeks400mcg,9/24/2015Email,Actiq
3, 4, Extreme pain,A number of years after I started taking taking Actiq. Due to taking it 4 to 5 times daily and for years and the contant dry mouth it directly caused. My gums started getting infected and cavities started and there was no stopping the gum infections and tooth decays.No matter how much I brushed and flossed. My teeth started busting and breaking out. All dentists I talked to say drymouth causes tooth decay and gum diseases. Last 5 years I lost around 12 teeth. Its caused byActiq. No doubt. Like tobacco causes lung cancer and was denied for decades by tobacco companies. Now Mallinckrodt Inc. in Hazelwood MO. and Cyprus Insurance and their adjusters are denying it to save money. For cyprus its all about money. Not the people.,The company who is responsible for selling Actiq will eventually lose in class action lawsuit. A big lawsuit. Its time they are held accountable for millions of dollars of ruining gums and teeth without proper admission. LETS ALL GET TOGETHER AND SUE AS ONE. HOW COULD WE LOSE? THE EDVIDENCE IS ALL THERE!!!!!!!,M,60,10  years400,5/16/2015,Actiq

F---in  insurance as if Cancer was the only pain the reason cancer gets terminal is because it doesn't hurt usually until its advanced_then its the chemo&radiation that causes the majority of pain.The lobbyists want to make it hard to get &more profit if denied these suckers &I've never had a drug dealer say I got these suckers that wont get you high but if you stub your toe for a mere $55 for a 5 cent sucker I can hook u up. This product that costs 5 actual cents 2make & is 95% sugar. People we are getting scammed.What about a burn_MS_ Lou Gerhigs_arthritis. Since when does this government have a right to dictate what is prescribed between me & my doctor who studied pain for 12 college years alone.The politicians are funded by big Pharma  & they dont want to pay 4 it.The best way to do that is make it only 1 thing it will pay for it under think of how r,Can you please help us fight these insurance companies & the government on the suckers? Why dont they make them like they were in 2002 where they weren't made of chalky_ crumbly stuff they were make of real sucker material. I didn't have to go threw a whole days worth due to them crumbling in seconds. The LAST of my life savings is going to a billion dollar industry and thats not enough. Hello immigrating to Canada here I come.Medicine shouldn't be dictated by ability to pay can Canada_ England_ Australia_ New Zealand etc all be wrong to get rid of these blood suckers insurance companies.I am paying  the price for some jerk who wants to get high off of this pain that feels like someone hit me in the back with a bat while putting out a fire on my back. Also stabbing when I get  back spasms. All this headache & heartache & scare tactics because some idiots probably 1 person put the patch in their mouth. I dont care if those opiate addicts die for screwing things up because Mommy didn't want to say no to Jr male or female and that created unbearable treatment by doctors & people who dont know me in pain and they are usually spoiled young & healthy. Id give anything to get my health back & never touch this medication.

7, 1, Fibromylgia,plan on getting dentures_ I have lost most of my teeth.   Unfortunately Medicare does not care if you have teeth or not!  Apparently either does the manufacturer of Actiq_ this should be a main warning!  Also sugar went up to pre-diabetic_ before actiq_ I had low blood sugar.   I stopped the medication.   Enough damage has been done and that is only what I can see and read on a regular CBC.,I took great care of my teeth on actiq and still lost them.  I believe most people loose their teeth.  I think Actiq should make this a main warning or start paying for dentures.If I had it to do over again_ I would not start.  It does not help that much.I go off_ because I went from 70 to 140 on my sugar level_ I do not want to add diabetic to my list of issues.,F,52,7  years200 3X D,4/3/2014Email,Actiq

11, 4, Avascular necrosis and severe back,I also lost my teeth_ but it turned out okay. I always wanted braces and we couldn't afford it so now I have straight teeth now and a great smile. It was a lot of suffering though with the jaw pain and the extensive surgery I needed. Actiq works but I don't understand as an RN why they can't find a formulation besides the patch which I also wear_ that will help a breakthrough dose of Actiq last longer than the pops. These pops are addictive but I have one of the best pain specialist in the country and he put me on a maintenance dose of Methadone that helps with that withdrawel feeling in between. The addiction is not addiction_ it is a physical dependence when it comes to a person who legitamely needs pain medicine. I have severe Avascular Necrosis and had both hips replaced already. My back is basically collapsing from arthritis and degenerative disc disease as well.

12, 5, Bilateral TotalJointReplacement TMJ,I LOVE this medication because it has been the only medication that has really helped my severe chronic pain from my total joint replacement of my tmj. I also take avinza. From the first day that I started this medication I had NO idea that I would lose all of my teeth. It has been literally terrible on my quality of life. There should be a class action lawsuit because all most EVERYONE that has taken this drug has lost most or all of their teeth. Since my total joint replacement I cannot open very wide at all. I just had to have a total mouth extractions last Oct. and I have had terrible problems. One being that they (meaning the dentist) left me with literally NO ridge at all so I am unable to wear a bottom denture. Now I have to have implant surgery that my insurance will NOT pay for even though all of my doctors say it is medically necessary because my total joint replacment will fail since I have no proper support. My top denture is completely crooked and I have been in more extre,If there are any attorneys who are considering a class action lawsuit please email me as I would be interested in getting on board. Although I am not sure that if you sue you would have to stop using the medication and Actiq has been the only pain med to really help my severe chronic pain. It is a very difficult situation and now since my insurance will not pay for my medically necessary implants I don't know where to turn. I cannot eat anything but very soft food and have lost my appetite and only eat 1 meal a day.

I was able to care for my mother who had a terminal illness and live a productive lifestyle. I'd trade my teeth again for a quality life.  They would not prescribe it for my mother for fear of her falling asleep with it in her mouth; gave her fentanyl patch instead_ which I believe contributed to her respiratory failure.

Just yesterday my face blew up and I waqs rushed over and had two teeth removed and grafted to releive the serious infection. I have been hopitalized for c-diff colitis fro clindomyacin 3 times. I am at my wits end and now a full mouth recunstruction after all this work.I have been so sick physically and mentally and without our Government thinking out mouth is part of our bodies when it comes to medical coverage it is making people struggle even disbled with no where to go when these problems occurr except blogs like this for us to vent and know we are all not alone.,I think we all need to get a class action started_ I am sure any attorney would take this on as there are enough of us out there if anyone agrees or is interested respond here or to my email and put it on any site you see someone has to help us allget some help with our teeth and medical issues compromised from this as well. thank you,F,48,6  days600 mcg 4X D,2/19/2011Email,Actiq

17, 5, Fibromyalgia,Tooth decay & sleepiness,I actually take 12/day_ but the pull-down menu didn't offer that choice!This is a miracle drug for me! I tried just about every other pain medication out there_ and few worked. The few that did work_ I quickly built up a tolerance to and they quit working after 3 months to a year. I was mostly bedridden from Fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis in my right knee before using Duragesic patches (3 50mcg patches at once_ change oldest patch each day) and Actiq. My husband's company switched from Express Scripts to Cigna_ and now I'm having to fight to get my Fentanyl. We got my patches approved with just a preauthorization. But it's taking us forever to get the Actiq approved. I just pray that they eventually do approve it. I don't want to go back to being bedridden.

Any dentist will tell you side effects of dry mouth: the decaying of teeth & gum disease!! drinking soda is the worst...but it worked for me. Dentists can also prescribe special toothpaste to help. The best side effect.....I was able to  have somewhat of a more normal quality of life! So many meds. make you feel so tired_ ACTIQ didn't for me. Can someone tell me why it's so expensive?????? The cost is just not right. The people that need it can't afford it.,"ACTIQ name brand works. It's the only one. The first generic to come out did not! Not at all. Pharmacists kept telling me they were the same. Who would you believe the person one it for years or someone that never used it! Most Insurance company's would then only pay for generic (which wasn't much cheaper) then they said unless you have a severe form of CANCER that they will not pay for it.

Everyone I meet that has taken it has lost their teeth or half their teeth and my doctor will not even prescribe it any more because all his patients had tooth problems. I brushed before_ after_ it does not matter.  This stuff just sits on your teeth and rots them away.  THe company is now in trouble because none of the insurance companies are willing to pay for it anymore. So between the price and the rotting teeth the company has some real PR work to do. I think a big law firm should take them on. There are thousands of patients who have lost their teeth and this company could care less.,Stay away from this drug at all costs. That is my best comment.,F,45,5  days1600 mcg 6X D,7/5/2010,Actiq

I always use it on the right side of my mouth &  all the bottom teeth on that side of my mouth now have cavities at the gum line. I just had to have a bridge made for a cost of over $3200 all because of this drug. We should all sue them to get our dental paid for-this is horrible. I'm disabled & don't have the money to pay for the rest of my teeth,Besides the teeth the other problem is insurance. I will not be able to afford this drug much longer as I've had to pay out of pocket. Even though AARP Medicare D assured me 4 times they would pay for the drug no matter what my DX_ once I signed up they refused to pay because I'm blessed not to have Cancer.

And_ disability refused to pay for it. The drug was good the side effects now are devistating_ making me home bound because like other's I no longer have teeth. I spent 5 years in braces_ first 3 through Jr. High then when my wisdom teeth came in_they had to pull them and I had to spend 2 more years in braces and while I was just about done with my retainer at 16 I had a car accident where the car rolled 5 times and I went halfway out of the sunroof the car rolled over ontop of me_ broke me in half_ and rolled 2 more times. While in intensive care with a resperator and no retainer my teeth all spaced out so about 8 months again in braces. Now with Chronic pain_ closed head injury_ back broken in 7 places_ and 33 corrective surgeries since. Actiq worked good compared to other pain med's. But_ now I have 7 teeth left. I am so embarassed to go out. Who would wan,If I knew then what I know now_ I never would have taken it. At this time my next option is a Morphine pump or shotgun. I didn't go through all the pain of wearing head grear_ the throbbing of the orthodic rubber bands. The stanless steal smile as a teenage girl. Actiq did work sure_ but I really would like to actually EAT SOMETHING that is solid SOON. I have no molers_ both gold crowns snaped off and my last 5 on the bottom in the front are not looking so good. So_ they will be next. What the HECK is a person TO DO? I sure hope that the Manufacture and Disributor get to read some of these. Being Disabled is bad enough_ but the medication they give you that is suppose to help make's all your teeth fall out_ is a very-VERY BAD thing.

Also_ mouth ulcers_ tongue lesions_ Dental Problems - losing 4 rear molars_ having 4 or 5 root canals _ multiple bonding's to repair crumbling teeth_ and many_ many cavities since 2005 . Just recently_ I  had a very painful root canal done which almost ruined my entire Christmas_ only to have 1/2 of another tooth fall out in my hand a week later.  That day (a few days ago) I seriously felt like I was losing my mind and realized that there must be something way more serious going on with my teeth than I had imagined. Miraculously_ I happened to go on the Internet and read on a web site regarding Actiq and Tooth Decay Lawsuits.  It gave me the answer to my constant horrible teeth problems that no,"Actiq does help with the excruciating back pain when Morphine is'nt enough_ but they should have ""worked out all the bugs"" before they put it on the market & get chronic pain sufferers addicted to it. I would definitely like to see Cephalon punished for their GREED_ keeping people in the dark about all the side effects.  Getting some type of settlement to recoup my losses would definitely help give me some needed relief.

But after 5 yrs of brand name my teeth are shot & I'm only 36! I think the new formula did more damage with its sweettart texture! Swirling those against your teeth was bound to eat away at enammal! So my 5 is not for actiq but the ones my pharm. Is authorized to make. If you live in IL email me for info. I also take Mscontin 75 mg 3 times a day soma & a few other things.

Though part my fault-poor dentist habits may have been controlled otherwise.  Issues with coming out of anesthesia from surgery.  I have such a tolerance-I wake up way too soon and am totally coherant within minutes while everyone around me is out cold.  Nursing staff amazed.  Euphoric when I'm very tired and sleep deprived.  Weak cough reflex.  All in como w/fentanyl patches-lethal dose.,I see alot of the remarks about Actiq and wonder how many of these neg. issues are from a combination of the additional narcotics we are on.  I don't believe Actiq on its own is causing all of these dependency problems.  I have been taking Duragesic patches for nearly 7 years along with Actiq for break through.  Quickly got up to lethal doeses @ 400mcg every 48rs and 1200mcg Actiq 6X a day and could easily raise both of those now to 500 & 1600 mcg's.  Have been at current dose for 3 years.  Took 5+ yrs b4 teeth became an issue_ though I take care of them at home I also have not seen a dentist in over 18 years since I had perfect teeth and no known problems.  Was wheelchair bound and could not stand/walk straight.  Fentanyl has been an amazing drug after the full gamit of pills for years ending w/oxycontin 80mg and the 20+ useless epidural injections.

45, 5, back pain due to 3 level fusion,None,I've been taking Actiq for 5 years and it made a tremendous impact on my life. The previous pain meds I had taken didn't provide the relief of Actiq as quickly or as long_ as well as didn't give me the mental buzz feeling. After using this medication without issue for 5 years_ all the sudden Aetna isn't going to cover it unless you're a cancer patient. This reeks of a big insurance company trying to save money due to the popularity of Actiq. Instead_ it's being presented as their team of doctors and consultants have determined what's best for the patient.  It's amazing without ever seeing me_ they know better than a Pain Managment doctor who specializes in treating patients who live in pain.  Oh_ but if you do get their approval_ they'll allow 15 lozenges for 30 days. Why bother?  Again_ it's all about money rather than what's best for the patient_ regardless of the amount of money paid monthly for premiums.,M,46,5  years,7/11/2007,Actiq

47, 5, Migraine,I had nausea and vomiting from the Actiq (on top of the nausea and vomiting from the migraine) until I learned to titrate the dose better.  Slower dosing & removing the lozenge from my mouth after a minute of application and waiting a few minutes before using more has eliminated the opioid-induced nausea I used to get (unless it's tolerance that explains it).  I was concerned about my teeth from the start so I always brush after Actiq as soon as I feel up to it.,Actiq has been wonderful for my migraines.  Nothing else had worked_ and trips to the ER had been miserable experiences.  The rapid time to onset of relief coincides perfectly with the time from my migraine aura's time of onset to the onset of pain.  My migraines_ averaging about a dozen times a year_ used to make me non-functional for a couple days feeling like I was going to die in tremendous agony.  Since Actiq_ they are now just a tolerable headache through which I can function adequately.  I can't benefit from oral meds because my migraine makes me vomit whatever I swallow (and I didn't respond to injectable Imitrex).  Now_ I can often even avoid vomiting from the migraine if I am cautious about the rate at which I absorb the fentanyl.,,,4  years,4/15/2007Email,Actiq

This drug has totally messed up my life. I wished I had never taken it. It has 8o times the strengh of morphine_ it should never be in the hands of people who have a life to live. It should only be given to terminal patient whom addiction is no longer a problem. This company is a joke. All they were after is making monies at the expense of the patients. The docs are not to blame_ they found out too late that it was not what is was intented for. Shame on the pharmaceutical company. many people have dies from this drug_ children thought this drug was a lolipop and died!!

For some reason_ the actiq in the new formulation never did work.  As soon as I used it_ the migraine continued & continued without working at all.,I have no idea why the new formulation changed the working of the fentanyl in the med but it no longer worked.

I believe there is a major misunderstanding of this word. Within the chronic pain community as well as within the general public. Addiction is an aberrent psychological condition where one beleives they must have this drug and would do anything to obtain the drug.

IF ACTIQ CAN GIVE THEM SOME PAIN RELIEF IN THEIR FINAL DAYS_ THEN IT SERVED ITS INTENT.,IF YOU ARE SCI AND TRYING TO SURVIVE_ ACTIQ BECOMES YOUR CRUTCH.

71, 5, Severe abdominal pain,Absolutely none,I have been using 5 1200 mcg a day for two years and my  pain has been well controlled.  Had to use it as my main pain med because all of the others I tried (methadone_ oxycontin_ etc) gave me severe side effects due to the amount of other medications I was taking for other problems.  Now my pain doctor is getting out of the business because he can't take the political pressure and no other doctor in southwest Michigan will prescribe it.  They won't give their real reason for not prescribing; they are trying to say they're afraid someone will break into your house and steal it or a child may get it but can't they get the other drugs prescribed too?  Totally assinine coming from medical professionals.  Let's just be honest.  So now I have to use drugs that are not as effective and will probably end up back on my couch with a heating pad and of no use to anyone_ not my husband_ daughter or anyone else_ most of all to myself.

74, 5, 7 Sinus and facial bone surgeries,BAD tooth decay.  Sleepless nights.  Bad night sweats. very quick pain relief.,I will sue if and when I find a way.  I feel as the others_ I WILL NOT give up my teeth without a fight.  I had perfect teeth 4 years ago and I DID brush 3 times a day.  It makes your mouth look like a crack users mouth.  I was told today by my dentist I will lose 10 teeth.  They are in such bad shape_ they will not even take a filling.  Is it me or are these teeth 90 - 95% on the upper and lower SIDES???  That is where the instructions say place the pop.  Please email me if you want to try for class action.  Remember it takes a small few to start_ then everyone else joins up.  But the few to start have a larger share for causing and starting the suit.  Stadol lost several million dollar law suit and it is still selling like hot cakes.,M,44,3.5  years,10/26/2005Email,Actiq
75, 5, Chronic LBP,Hot flashes.  Could be from Norco_ but onset of flashes noticed after starting Actiq.,I have been using Norco 325/10 x 3 daily for years to manage chronic lower back pain.  Even at that level this amounts to too much Tylenol_ as I am HCV positive.  My blood levels are fine_ and have been since contracting Hepatitus C in the early 80s.  I developed stasis dermititus as a side effect of all this hydrocodone in my system.  It's not serious_ but I wanted to remove the Tylenol component. With pain meds all of my pain is break through_ my pain is only chronic in the sense that it happens about three times a day_ every day_ especially if I am active.  W/o pain meds I am in chronic pain 24 hours a day.  So_ I started up with Actiq 200_ and now I only need one Norco a day and two Actiq to live pain free. As far as I'm concerned_ this drug is a miracle_ because there is no,M,51, ,8/25/2005,Actiq
76, 4, FBSS & RSD (nerve damage spine),No real side effects other than begin problem w/teeth but noticed a high dosage antibiotic reduces syptoms...,I live with the worst imaginable pain the body and mind can endure. This is the only medicine that gives me real releif without making me loopy or tired. Problem is the body seems to become use to it quickly. I'm maxed out at 1600 mcg x 10 per day. Not sure where to go from here. Other drawbacks are the teeth issue but like I said I found if I took a HIGH dose antibiotic they got better but sensitivity came back after I stopped_I believe we are getting a gum diease which can be treated (try the antibiotic w/oral rinse Gly-oxide)and you have to COMPLETELY get rid of the diease or it comes back and/or gets worse. This concerns me greatly_ I was mortified to read people getting dentures because of it. I talk to manufactor and they lead me to believe they never heard of the teeth problem before?? Because I have no dental insurance I wanted them to pay for dental bills_ we should think about case action to get them to pay for bills_ or simply back them in a corner to force them to hire the best dentist to figure out exactly what is doing this and how to prevent and repair damage done. I don't believe its just the sugar. I'll be damned if I'm loosing my teeth without a fight. Also_ although I am struggling with the public asspect (even with those close to me) of being a chronic pain sufferer therefore needing a narcotic on a regular basis and the judgement of those who don't understand leaving me ashamed and guility with comments like,F,39,2  years,7/16/2005Email,Actiq

82, 4, back pain (BT med),Tolerance build-up comes fast. Dizziness/lightheadedness upon using it the 1st time.  After that no problem.  Lower doses ineffective after 6 months or so. New formulation can cause raw feeling inside cheek.,This is the best BT (break-thru) med that I have used to date.  It will nearly stop the pain within 10 min or at least make it more tolerable.  EXTREMELY expensive.  Mfg needs to make a sugar-free version to reduce tooth problems and/or increased glucose levels.  Short acting_ but better than any oral med available that can work this fast. Wished the relief would last longer though.  But that is better than nothing.,F,40,2  years,1/23/2005,Actiq

85, 5, Surgery on hand.,None. ,Worked_ but when I came to my hand was in pain so I needed a shot of a ligher narcotic (demerol) and then when I was out of the P.O. room and was ready to walk out and leave I was in pain again so i was given a 10mg dose of vicoden before i left. She said something about me having a high tolerance_ but thats just how my body workes I guess because she said most people are at least slightly naseaus after surgery and don't need extra pain killers right away. anyway_ I got a ride home from my mother and I had the munchies so we went to get coffee at dunken donuts and I ate a dozzen soft tacos toco bell after because I remeber the nurse saying before I left surgery that eating greasy food would keep the drugs in my system longer. anyway_ after that I took four vicodens watched some T.V. then went to sleep early.
