0, 1, Post Surgery,This drug was given to our daughter post surgery. She had a T & A_ sinus surgery_ septoplasty and bilateral ear tubes placed with a history of sleep apnea. She became somnolent and unresponsive and was diagnosed as a hypermetabolizer of codeine which converts the codeine in the liver to toxic levels of morphine. She almost died as a result with collapsed lungs and hypoxia. This drug has black box warnings from the FDA and should have never been given to our daughter with her medical history and indicated surgeries.,,F,8,2  times 2X D,7/22/2013Email,Capital with codeine
