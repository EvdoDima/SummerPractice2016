0, 4, chronic sinus infection,tired,This medication is great. Only thing that worked for my sinus infection. 2 other stints on other antibiotics would not even touch it. No diarrhea_ no yeast infection. Now I will say that I took a lot of probiotics while on this medication. All females should take probiotics while on any antibiotics as it keeps the yeast build up at bay. Im sure it also helped with the regulation of the diarrhea.,F,34,21  days300 2X D,6/24/2016,Omnicef
1, 1, Sinus Infection Kidney Infection,Nausea_ Foggy Feeling_ Lower Back pain_ Anxiety_  Diarrhea_ Mucus in stool. total loss of appetite,I took the generic version of this drug Cefdinir for a combination of a sinus infection and a kidney infection. I noticed improvement on both infections within one day. By the end of my seven day run on this drug my infection symptoms seemed to be gone_ with only a bout of anxiety on the 3rd day. Also on the fifth day kind of lost my appetite a little. Things stayed like this through the rest of the prescription until the last day. That's when everything seemed really foggy_ and I just really felt drained of energy. This set off a pretty bad panic attack. Also had horrible back pain (Lower.) Diarrhea intensified on the 1st day after completing prescription. I am now 4 days after completing the 7 day round of this antibiotic and all the symptoms remain besides the anxiety. My description of events does not do the discomfort I have been feeling from this drug justice. I would never take this drug again or suggest it to anyone. Tomorrow will be 5 days after  finishing this crap and I still feel like death.,M,42,7  days300 MG 2X D,5/30/2016,Omnicef

4, 1, Sinus Infection,Although the medication has seemed to make the sinus infection subside_ I have had a severe headache for the past 7 days I have been on it. I have a pounding sensation in the back of my head and no Advil Tylenol etc is helping to make it stop. The few times it did subside the pounding in the back of my head was replaced with a migraine in the front on the left side.

6, 1, Sinus Infection,Diarrhea_ Anxiety_ Foggy_ Loss of appetite_ Dry Mouth_ Slight cramping_ Vaginal Itching.,"I have taken Omnicef before_ more than 10 years ago and I dont remember the side effects being this severe then. But this time around I have felt absolutely horrible. First I had an ""accident"" where I couldnt make it to the bathroom in time_ even tho I was home it was horrifying. I called Patient First where I asked if I could take Imodium to help with the diarrhea_ they said they wanted me to finish the course of the medicine and if in 2 days the Imodium didnt help to come back in. And it did get better with the Imodium combined with the yogurt (Activia) The anixtey/dpression started about 3 days ago and I didnt even think that it might be caused by the medicine until reading all of the comments on here that sound identical to my symptoms. I have been a sufferer of anxiety before but it has been more than 9 years since Ive had any issues with it. But the last few days on this medicine have just been horrible. I feel foggy_ not confused but just like something isnt right. Its sad because it knocked the Sinus Infection right out a few days in_ but now I'm left feeling anxious_ no appetite in 3 days_ and very loose stools. I have been eating yougurt with probiotics which seems to help with the frequency of the diarrhea. I have been telling my boyfriend for days I cant wait to STOP this mediciation to feel better mentally. I know its never good to stop an antibiotic before its stupposed to be stopped but I'll get something else if I have to. I will NEVER take this medi",F,31,7  days,4/6/2016Email,Omnicef
7, 1, Cold to Double Ear Infections,Severe_ throbbing_ unrelenting headache in the back of the head.,Someone brought their sick kid to work who projectile vomited all over me in the elevator. A week later I was sick and had double ear infections. I went to the doctor and was prescribed Cefdinir for 10 days. I went back to the doctor 3 days later because I had developed a severe headache in the back of my head_ nothing helped with the pain. My vitals (blood pressure and heart rate) were so high the doctor sent me straight to the emergency room. At the ER they determined that the pain was causing the high blood pressure and rapid heart beat (rather than the other way around) and attributed the headache to the bacterial ear infections and told me to finish up the antibiotic and come back if the headache didn't go away. After 8 days of suffering tremendously with the throbbing_ debilitating headache I read about how severe back of the head headaches was a side effect of this drug. I stopped the drug after 8 days and on day 9 there was significant improvement. The headache is not gone but ibuprofen 1000mg and hydrocodone are somewhat managing it now. From what I've read the headache can last two days to a week after stopping the drug. I've never had an allergy or reaction to any medication before in my life. Shame on the FDA_ this drug should be taken off the market immediately.,M,39,10  days600 1X D,3/23/2016,Omnicef

21, 1, Sinus infection,"Severe red painful hives over entire body _ severe itching_  nausea and vomiting _ abdominal cramps _ feeling of ""impending doom"".","I am a nurse and have been for 24 years and until now I have never felt the need to comment on a medication.  I started cefdinir for a sinus infection and within 3 hours after my first and only dose I broke out in severe painful hives all over my body.  My face was blood red and I had swelling of my face_ ears_ lips_ and even my hands _ arms and legs were swollen and had very painful hives.  I was also itching terribly and had the sensation that my skin was ""crawling"". I've never felt that before and can't explain it any other way.  It felt like my skin was going to tear from the swelling and my fingers and wrists looked like they were going to burst open.  I also had severe nausea and vomited. I had cold sweats and felt a heaviness in my chest that actually scared me.  I was home alone and rationally I knew I needed to be seen and treated.  I ended up taking a large dose of Benadryl and decided to wait.  The nurse in me doesn't like being a patient but truly I was scared by the severe reaction I had.   I know I needed epinephrine and am just grateful that I had only taken one dose and was able to get through it after Benadryl.  My joints remained swollen and sore for the next couple of days and my skin _ while the hives were gone _ was overly sensitive to touch and actually hurt for several days afterwards.  I also felt totally exhausted for a couple of days.  I've taken antibiotics in the past and have never had an adverse reaction to any drug.  I know many people",F,45,1  days,12/27/2015,Omnicef

68, 1, Sinus Infection,My son took this horrible antibiotic for 3 weeks and I absolutely feel sick myself for letting him take it for this long. On this medication he had severe headaches_ severe nausea and severe abdominal pain and pain in his neck_ especially when he looked down. He also had joint pain in various places on his body. He missed 18 days of school. He had a CT scan that showed he had a very bad sinus infection_ so we knew he needed to be treated with antibiotics. While taking this medication I had to take him to the ER twice. The last time we went they kept him over night and the next day to observe him. The pediatric neurologist came in said he was having migraines and abdominal migraines and would need to take a preventative for the migraines. My husband and I did some research on this antibiotic and also fell upon this webpage and truly believed it was the antibiotic that was the culprit. I had a hard time believing that my very healthy boy before this sinus infection happened....who was playing soccer_ no health problems so far could just develop migraines. I'm sure it happens_ but we had a feeling it was the medicine. As soon as we stopped the antibiotic he slowly started feeling better. Today is day 4 off of antibiotic and he is back to his silly_ bouncing off the wall_ energetic kid again. The headache is completely gone but still having just a little but of abdominal pain.

I always took it with food. It cleared up a very nasty Asian bacteria contacted while I was in South Korea and two months later_ cleared up pneumonia while living in Texas. Neither Amoxicillin nor Zmax(2000 mg dose) were beneficial for the pneumonia.  I took Omnicef for 10 days along with 3 days of steroid.,I trust this medicine.

116, 1, Sinus Infection,Got a severe allergic reaction to this drug which was masked by the Benadryl that I was taking in conjunction with it. Steadily worsening breathing difficulty_ misdiagnosed on 3 separate occasions by 2 physicians and EMS (bronchitis_ asthma_ hyperventilation aka panic attack Jeez_ I couldn't breathe!). Finally was prescribed massive dose of methylprednisolone which helped breathing immediately.  Then I went on to take my next dose of Omnicef and 15 minutes later couldn't breathe again.  Throat closing up etc.  It was only then that I figured it out.  Stopped Omnicef IMMEDIATELY.  And have had no trouble breathing since.,Complaint here is that the package insert AND the info found on the Internet under Omnicef search_ DID not suggest that an anaphylactic reaction is at all likely with this drug.  But in fact a general search for this class of antibiotics shows severe reaction in 1 in 5000 patients.  I had never had a reaction to an antibiotic previously.
