0, 4, Fibromyalgia,mind fog in morning_ had to increase dose as my body got used to it. Did have some dry mouth and diarhea too.,Asleep usually within an hour of taking it.

7, 5, I'm prescribed to endep for sleep,Dry mouth during the night and the next morning. I became extra tired during the day and found my self on and off napping which I don't normally do every day if I get a chance. I used to take seroquel do getting used to this is a lot easier so far. I also have a massive apetite after taking these approx 3 hrs before bed (if I hadn't accidentally fallen asleep in the mean time) I don't usually eat a lot because I suffer with heartburn so bad I rarely eat so I'm eating like I did on seroquel so I'm imagining I may gain weight.  Overall I've got to remember my bodies still adjusting..I suffer from I.B.S and have noticed change in the pain I usually endure all morning everyday before being prescribed to endep. I'm finally getting a full nights sleep without waking up 2-3 with severe anxiety so endep with my Valium (25mg a day) has had a significant effect. ,,F,26,10  days20mg,11/25/2014,Endep

18, 2, anxiety_ insomnia,From the git go_ this product 'zonked' me out big time_ to the point I stopped taking it after only 1 month.  I had been taking Zoloft (which worked great)_ but was prescribed Endep instead when I developed side effects (muscle twitches) after a few months. My doctor suggested I take half a tablet of Endep every night_ but then the dosage was too low and had no effect.  I suppose the full 25mg dose may have worked_ but I was so doped up I felt out of it anyway so I can't really say if it was effective or not.  I don't recommend this product.,,M,58,1  months25mg 1X D,3/4/2011,Endep
19, 3, neuropathic pain and insomnia,Dry mouth_ sour taste in mouth_ thirsty_ drowsy_ no libido and feeling low.,I recomend it's use if you suffer from pain and cannot sleep but since it's also used for depression I'm not sure if it will affect your mood if used for a long time I also take 50mg of zoloft but still feel depressed don't know if any of these drugs really work once your body gets used it.,M,45,8  years,11/27/2008,Endep
20, 3, lupus pain and lack of sleep,Endep did help with my muslce and joint pain and it was really good as a sleeping aid ( able to come of sleeping tabs 'stilnox' after 2 yrs of use)_ but I did have slight weight gain and I needed something stronger as an antidepressant as I was only on 25mg.,,F,32,5  months,8/7/2005,Endep
