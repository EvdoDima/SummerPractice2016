0, 1, HIV,Nausea__ diarrhoea and sickness_ weakness due to not eating due to loss of appetite from this horrible drug_ insomnia_ mood swings_ I could go on. Have decided to stop taking this as I do not want to be a slave to a little white tablet for the rest of my days_ there is no way I could function at work taking it as I am up all night going to the toilet. Hey I got HIV_ you live by the sword you die by the sword_ I am ready.,Might work for some but I have never felt so dreadful in my life_ there wasn't day go by where I didn't contemplate suicide. Life is about living not feeling shit 24 7.,M,46,10  days600,12/4/2014Email,Atripla
1, 5, HIV,severe hallucinations blur between conscious and non- consciousness_ vivid dreams_ Dizziness_ insomnia and just generally exhausted,First_ this drug is easy to take and keeps HIV under control.  But it has side effects.  I have learned to take it only at night before bed and never watch anything on TV that you don?t want in your Dreams.  Dam those BORG chasing me around with ?resistance is futile? !  I can?t tell you how many times I have woken in a panic thinking I have seen a person in my room only to be a robe on the door or a shadow on the ceiling.   A little prep can highly influence your dreams and avoid a high fat dinner this only makes it worse.  Have the fat at lunch and chicken for dinner watch something on TV you find pleasant or it will be with you all night long.  BTW_ don?t do what I did and forget you took the medication and take a second dose ? oh that was a long night of not even sure I was awake or asleep.,M,44,2  years 1X D,5/3/2013Email,Atripla
2, 5, Hiv,I have to say the first week was horrible. The nightmares r extreamly bad. But it has passed after the first week n now im doing  extremely well. Undetectible n good.cd4 count.,,M,25,1  days,3/18/2013,Atripla
3, 5, hiv,I've always taken atripla then gone to bed. Tonight I took it then stayed up to finish watching a movie.... Now I know why they say take it at bedtime..... I feel sort of drunk or slight lsd-type feeling..... Not bad_ but I wouldn't want to have to try and function at 100% at the moment  LOL,,M,50,3  months300,7/14/2012,Atripla
4, 5, HIV,Dizziness_ headache_ nausea_ depersonalization_ short term rash.,All side effects tapered off after my body adjusted to the new medicine. Still feel woozy sometimes_ but it's rare!,M,28,4  months 1X D,12/31/2011,Atripla
5, 4, HIV,severe hallucinations blur between conscious and non- consciousness. Sometimes nasuea.,Started 4 months ago with viral load of 500000. I wa so worried. Now I am undetectable. I feel so blessed to have atripla. However... The price is so high I have exhausted most optins to get it_ even state funding has started to cut back. My work insurance is giving me fits...1950 a month and a 100 dollar copayment.,M,23,120  days 1X D,7/10/2011Email,Atripla
6, 4, HIV infection,Super-personal_ bizarre_ lucid and sometimes instructive deep subconscious 'core' nightmares; Brain zaps when sleeping face down or when generating negative thought patterns about harming oneself or others (i call it Atripla positivity training); feeling of Godlessness / a stark feeling of existential emptiness / meaninglessness leading almost to a sense of but not a full fruition of depersonalization; malaise; fuzziness/tinnitus associated with eating high fat meals; increased flatulence; decreased ability to maintain continuous thought or deep concentration; sometimes turns you into a catatonic / zombie for an hour_ an hour after taking it (efavirenz/tenofovir) as it is hallucinogenic (alters your perception/expands space)_ increased sensitivity to light; the first week i was on it I thought i had superpowers because i had a 'different energy'...tried to lift my car (delusions),Although these side effects are life changing and frustrating to adjust to_ this drug is remarkably effective.  Undetectable within one month of taking it from high viral load and low t cell count_ essentially i had aids and now i don't.  people think_ you get aids_ you die.  not the case.  modern drugs are amazing.  aids is not any one thing but an indicator of low t cell count coupled with high viral load and usually some kind of symptom like pneumonia or cancers or other complains.  I know folks who've had aids several times over 20 yrs and keep bouncing back.  Atripla also scores high because it's a one a day formula.  There is big benefit in this.  I just wish I didn't have to get high every night on a hallucinogen.,M,37,2  years1100mg 1X D,3/17/2011,Atripla
7, 4, HIV,Lucky I was a child of the sixties. The first week was rough vivid dreams_ insomnia and just generally exhausted. Viral load went from 140000 to 63 in the first 3 months and CD4 from 230 to 385. Stick with it!!! Don't miss! Ambien helps with the sleep problems.,,M,62,7  months600 1X D,10/4/2010Email,Atripla
8, 5, HIV,Dizziness_ Vivid Dreams,I take Atripla right before bedtime so the dizziness sometimes aids in sleeping_ but sometimes the dreams are really bizarre and vivid - not nightmares - just strange.,M,,2  years,5/10/2009,Atripla
9, 5, HIV,dizziness_ trouble concentrating_ anxiousness_ indigestion_ vivid dreams,First week_ I thought I would have to quit_ but the effects are wearing off_ and I can even make it through the day if I forget at night then take it in the morning_ but it requires concentration. Viral load tanked to undetectable and CD4 over 700. Try to stick it out for a few months--it got better for me.,M,51,3  months,5/6/2009,Atripla
10, 5, Hiv,dizzy,I have only been taking atripla for 6 weeks. I just went into the doctor Nov. 19th to get bloodwork done. I started meds with a cd4 of 242 and viral load at 47000....We will see what happens after 6 weeks. I feel healthy and look good_ so I am staying as positive as I can. I went to the doctor in the nick of time.,M,41,6  weeks,11/20/2008,Atripla
11, 5, HIV...What else?,Dizziness and fatigue. The first week was rough. You learn to adjust.,This combination is a lifesaver and convenient with one pill a day. The side effects have never really gone away_ but like I said_ you adapt to the new normal. I've done very well with this drug. Undetectable for 3 years and CD-4s in the 800's.,M,35,3  years,11/7/2008,Atripla
