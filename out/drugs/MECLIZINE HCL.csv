0, 5, Water sounds in ear and unbalanced,No side effects,Have had a feeling of water in my ear and unbalanced sensation like being on a small boat in rough seas.  After 10 plus years of no other doctor finding a cure_ within 1 week of taking this medication_ my symptoms were gone.  I have been extensively tested by 3 ENT Dr's since 2002 and no one could ID my problem.  This worked!,F,66,60  days25 mg 2X D,2/23/2014Email,Meclizine hcl
1, 5, Motion sickness,I have tried over the counter products before for motion sickness. I was also prescribed for a long time promethazine syrup to take_ which I did for many years. But_ after having taken the promethazine syrup for so long_ it eventually stopped being truly effective for me anymore. I had come to a plateau and needed to be prescribed something else. So_ my doctor wrote me out a prescription for meclizine 25 mg chewable tablets for me to start taking. And_ now_ I just started taking that. If you are someone that suffers from motion sickness and the medications over the counter just don't work well enough for you_ I highly recommend going to the doctor and having him prescribe something for you that really will work much better for you.,I highly recommend the prescription meclizine tablets versus the over the counter stuff! It works a whole lot better.,F,38,2  days25mg 2X D,11/13/2013,Meclizine hcl
2, 5, Motion Sickness on a boat,Not sure why_ but coincidental that after I came home from my boat trip_ I have been experiencing a sensitive tongue!!! Very weird_ but my tongue is red_ sore_ tingily_ and taste buds a little affected. Its been 3 days now and still symptoms. I think because I took chewed the swallable tablets_ I had no water_ so I just chewed them. My kids took it too_ but they seem to be ok. I also gave a little to my grandson & seems like he acted excited at first_ but then he was knocked out for 14 hours after. Scary...The medicine did work well!!! Wish I had it on the way to the island_ we were vomiting. We took it as Dramamine Less Drowsy_ but we did get drowsy alot later in the days_ after taking 2 pills.,,F,44,1  days2 pills 1X D,8/7/2011Email,Meclizine hcl
3, 4, Motion sickness/Migraine/Vertigo,Sleepiness_ dizziness_ and sometimes even nausea_ but it almost always worked at relieving my nausea.,I've always gotten motion sick easily_ but about a year agoI began feeling off-balance all the time and started having migraines. I was having bad nausea almost daily. Meclizine saved my life. At 25mg/day to day and a half_ I'm usually good. It does make me dizzy_ especially if I take it before bed. It works better for me in the morning_ but you do have to adjust to the tiredness. It would make me dizzy_ but I didn't care about it because the nausea was gone. Occasionally_ it seemed to make me sick_ but I still use it when neededIt also saved my life on a cruise when I got extremely motion sick. I could not hold down even a little water_ and thought I was going to die. The ship gave me 50 mg and I was cured in 45 min.,M,42,8  months,1/8/2010,Meclizine hcl

5, 5, vertigo_ dizziness_ spinning,I didn't have any side effects that I can recall.,I took it after I suffered a skull fracture_ petrious ridge fracture & torn dura. I couldn't lie on my back or look up without a spinning feeling.  The meclizine took it away as long as it took to heal.  I'm now off it and healed.,F,27,3  months,9/26/2005,Meclizine hcl
