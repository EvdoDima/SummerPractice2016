0, 1, Asthma,Severe behavioural problems_ sadness_ tantrums_ uncontrollable anger_ weight gain_ issues mimicking OCD_ emotional breakdowns,My 7 year old son was on Alvesco and his behavioural problems began gradually.  We did not realize the extent until a full blown out breakdown whereby he couldn't leave the house.  Realized it was the meds but doctors refused to confirm. He sent to psychotherapy for behavioural issues.  Took him off Alvesco and he returned to his usual happy laid back self. Switched to Flovent in past 7 months. Now starting our son is saying he's sad and scared again and doesn't know why.  Taking him off Flovent and must discuss other options with Dr. Alvesco was a nightmare for the whole family.,M,7,3  years 1X D,4/8/2015Email,Alvesco
1, 3, Asthma,Sometimes after i take a dose I have a weird feeling in my throat/chest that lasts about 30 seconds_ especially on days I'm not breathing well. Kind of feel like I have an air bubble stuck in upper chest/trachea. It's a mild sensation and since I don't get it each time_ Dr said to keep using. Also I noticed that since I take it I have tiny bumps (acne kind) that come and go on cheeks and upper chest but it could be caused by something else_ I'm not sure it's related. Not 100% satisfied as I still have to use the rescue inhaler a few times per week_ but I do feel better when waking up and when I have asthma symptoms they are milder than before.,,F,28,5  months,9/10/2014,Alvesco
2, 1, Asthma,Strong pain in center of chest after first use. Pain which lingered for 2+ hours. Like prickly glass. Made me cough_ and congested. Discontinued use immediately. Medicine far worse than the condition it was supposed to treat.,I have had to stop using Flovent for the same reason. Started aggravating my chest and aggravating my symptoms. I tried Alvesco once and found it the same as Flovent. I'm having trouble finding an inhaler to work for me because of adverse reactions. I may be more sensitive to meds than others_ but somewhat frustrated to have such a strong negative reaction after using once.,F,40,1  days160 1X D,5/16/2014,Alvesco

4, 3, Severe asthma attack,My son has been on Alvesco for 4 months_ high dosage since his severe asthma attack in the summer. Previously he was on Flovent_ and experienced occassional frequent urination_ which would clear up quickly if we halved the dosage for a while. For the last 6 weeks_ while on Alvesco_ he has experienced major behaviour change - bursting into tears for almost no reason_ extremely anxious about many things_ including his peanut allergy (wouldn't even eat at home for 2 days!)_ and frequent urination (20 to 30 times a day). We halved the dosage 4 weeks ago and have seen no improvement_ even worsening behaviour. I'm hoping that by completely stopping the medication for a while we can get him back to normal_ and manage his asthma with Ventolin.,The puffer discharge doesn't seem reliable - it doesn't depress forcefully like Ventolin or Flovent.,M,5.5,4  months200 mcg 2X D,11/24/2013Email,Alvesco
5, 1, for severe asthma,Behavior outside of the range of normal for her personality.  Fits of temper_ irritability_ inability to perform simple mental tasks (adding!)_ Clumsiness_ forgetful - inability to follow simple directions_ worsening of asthma_ foul language_ night terrors_ not affectionate_ depressed thoughts_ etc.,My daughter (on Alvesco from ages 7-11) has had times off this medication when her asthma is under better control or when we suspect that the medication was the cause of the behavioral changes in her - so we do see a return to her old self (faster than a calculator in math! affectionate_ polite_ cooperative_ a good sleeper_ great sense of humour etc.) but we always have to go back on it because the asthma eventually gets bad again.,F,11,4  years 1X D,9/12/2012Email,Alvesco
6, 2, Allergy Induced Asthma,Made constricted throat much worse. Loss of breath was eventually made worse.,I have a history of occasional tightness in my throat_ linked to my outdoor mold allergy. But I had always been able to swallow a normal sized bite. Two months into starting Alvesco_ I started having severe throat constriction_ so severe that I had my esophagus stretched two months later. My allergist and I chocked it up to the dry winter weather. I was reduced to soft foods only_ and considerably smaller sized bites. Three days ago I decided to go off Alvesco_ to see whether this was a factor_ and to use my albuterol if needed. Despite constant rain_ which releases mold spores into the air_ already I can eat larger bites and don't get that urgent choking feeling. I've had little constriction. Alvesco made it far worse! And I haven't needed my albuterol once!  Today I have breathed noticably better than I have in months! And again_ this is during a very rainy season for my mold allergy.  So I believe Alvesco made my asthma WORSE!,F,51,8  months160 mcg. 2X D,6/22/2011EmailHistory,Alvesco
7, 4, Asthma,Was prescribed this medication because of my severe asthma symptoms and have only been on it for a few weeks but have seen no side effects as of yet.,,F,25,2  weeks400mcg 1X D,4/29/2011Email,Alvesco
8, 3, COPD,Recurring chest infections.  More susceptible to illness.  Chronic fungal infection between my toes that was very difficult to treat.,Coming off alvesco was difficult the first couple of weeks - the COPD symptoms were much worse.  After a month my COPD has settled down to a manageable level.I also have ulcerative colitis_ for which I don't take any steroid-based treatment.  I believe taking this reduced my colitis symptoms.  When coming off alvesco my colitis became massively worse_ though this also settled down after a month_ and is actually much better than when I was taking alvesco.,M,34,1  years40mg 1X D,5/25/2010Email,Alvesco
