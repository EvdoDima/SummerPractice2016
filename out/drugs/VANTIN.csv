1, 4, UTI/kidney infection,Yeast infection_ but normal with antibiotics.I was given Vantin 100mg twice daily after being on IV antibiotics for 4 days.  I actually quit them due to being so sick and visiting my doctor. My doctor switched me to levaquin_ which I found out was poison and was having side effects after 8 days of it_ plus it wasn't helping my infection.  I decided to take the Vantin after quitting levaquin and my symptoms have imoroved.  I still have kidney pain_ but my fever is gone.The IV medication_ which is in the same class as Vantin worked the best.  I had a bad doctor at the hospital that took me off the IV antibiotics early.  I will use Vantin again if needed for UTI/kidney infection.Now I hope I do not have permanent damaging effects from the leviquin.,,F,38,6  days100,1/22/2012,Vantin
