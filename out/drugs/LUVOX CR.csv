2, 1, Cervical Dystonia,Was on it for a month and it caused extreme sedation.  I was sleeping for about 19 hours a day (no joke!).  It did not help the Cervical Dystonia and when I saw a neurologist about the Dystonia_ he told me to get off of the Luvox CR right away.,This medicine made me non-functional and extremely sedated.  I do not recommend it and don't plan on taking it again.  There are numerous meds that you should not take with this medication_ including Valium and other benzodiazepines.

4, 5, Clinical Depression,none,After trying the well-known antidepressants_ which gave me HORRIBLE side effects_ this was the only one which made me feel normal.,F,35,12  years100 mg 1X D,9/25/2010,Luvox cr
5, 5, OCD_ anxiety_ depression,Shakiness_ insomnia_ RLS worsened_ harder to orgasm_ weight loss.,I never realized before that my symptoms were symptoms of OCD. My doctors had tried me on almost every antidepressant and none seemed to help very much. I went to see a new doctor who sat down with me and really talked to me about my symptoms. He realized that I was having obsessive thoughts that I had no control over. He asked me to give this drug a try since nothing else was helping. I did_ within days I started to feel better. Yes_ I have listed adverse side effects_ however the benefits for me far outway the negative side effects. I am very happy with this medicine. Also_ I should mention that I have dealt with obsessive thoughts since I was a young child. I still have an occasional obsession but I am able_ on only 150 mg to control them. It is so great to finally feel normal.,F,42,4  months150 mg 1X D,6/2/2010Email,Luvox cr
6, 4, Anxiety_ OCD_ & Major Depression,(continued from post made on 5/13/10)  I'm wondering if this drug has contributed to dulling my already compromised memory.  Unless I take notes or make itemized lists_ I have moments where I'm totally clueless.  This is a problem that has become progressively worse over several years of SSRI use_ so I can't solely blame Luvox for this issue.  I may have to accept the theory that years of AD use has contributed to some damage to my brain and Luvox just continues to slowly add to it.  I really have no solid explanation.  (I'm a construction worker_ not a doctor.)  Are the side effects worth it?  In my case_ yes.  It's a high price to pay_ but unless you know what it's like to live every day in a state of intense grief (even when no one died)_ I feel that_ for me_ the benefits outweigh the risks.,(continued from post made on 5/13/10)  As for my OCD_ which manifests itself as trichotillomania (hair pulling)_ Luvox hasn't helped me at all with this issue.  I just added the supplement NAC (1800 mg) to my vitamin regimen last week_ and so far_ it seems to be helping.  Out of the many AD's I have tried over the span of 20 years_ none have been perfect.  Some have been simply ineffective while some have been nightmarish.  The ones that offered relief had to eventually be discontinued because of intolerable side effects (NO ability to feel ANY emotion_ MASSIVE weight gain) or because they simply lost effectiveness over time.  Luvox CR has been the best for my symptoms.  It's no Holy Grail_ but it has given me a quality of life I would not otherwise have.,F,35,5  months150 mg 1X D,5/15/2010Email,Luvox cr
7, 4, Anxiety_ OCD_ & Major Depression,In the beginning_ all I wanted to do was sleep.  I still have my moments of lethargy and lack of motivation_ but I can function.  My ability to orgasm while on this drug has been erased_ but luckily_ I found a compromise.  On the occasional Friday night_ I will skip my dose.  By Saturday PM_ I am able to have an orgasm with no problem.  Needless to say_ I usually spend my Saturday evening making up for the pleasure I missed out on during the week!  I sometimes find myself getting a bit jittery and irritable when I skip a dose_ but since it's only ONE dose_ I don't go into full SSRI-withdrawal mode.  I just take my Saturday night dose right before I go to sleep_ and I'm fine on Sunday.  Unlike other AD's I've been on_ this one doesn't make me ravenous.  The cravings and constant hunger I used to have while on Lexapro are a thing of the past.  I have lost a few pounds and will hopefully continue to do so.  (to be continued ...),This drug is not marketed in the USA for depression_ but it is used (off label) to treat it.  My debilitating depression is now a thing of the past.  I actually don't want to die.  I want to live and love and learn and enjoy my life.  Unlike other AD's I've been on_ this one does not blunt my emotions to the point of making me a zombie.  I still laugh and cry and have the ability to be creative.  My feelings are simply APPROPRIATE for the situation I am in.  My intense anger and hostility?  Gone.  I'll feel the normal irritability when I'm around people that do stupid things_ but I don't fantasize about slamming their heads against brick walls.  My anxiety?  Gone.  I used to take benzos fairly regularly before I was on Luvox.  I haven't taken them in months.  I don't need to.  Intrusive thoughts?  Those are gone too.  I don't repetitively play out my own death in my head anymore.  I don't obsess over things I can't control.  I don't think about self mutilating.
