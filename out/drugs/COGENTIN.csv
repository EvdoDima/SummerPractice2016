0, 2, Akathisia,I take Seroquel 100mg as a sleep aid. It works really well in low doses with few side effects but as you go up with dosage on antipsychotic_ bad things can happen....but Cogentin was pretty nasty all way around...First of all_ it didn't really help...I got almost no sleep last night because I was so restless...I will list the really crappy side effects below,drowsiness_ difficulty urinating_ EXTREME dry mouth  and its a thirst I couldn't quench_ feeling quite foggy and just dragged out along with difficulty/slow speaking.  However_ I know that Cogentin is a first line treatment to the EPS side effects caused by anti-psychotics...so I'm sure it works for many people but I personally had a bad reaction,M,28, 4mg 1X D,7/2/2015,Cogentin
1, 1, Cervical Dystonia,5 mg. - This worsened Cervical Dystonia.  It could be due to the antihistamine (diphenhydramine) in it.  I'm not sure.    It also caused tiredness_ insomnia_ acid reflux_ blurry vision_ headache_ indigestion and loss of appetite.  I also had a slightly bad taste in my mouth.  [Note:  I was still on Clonazepam at the time].  I tried it three times.,This did not help out the Cervical Dystonia at all_ but actually worsened it.  This could be due to the antihistamine in it.  I have noticed that certain antihistamines worsen Cervical Dystonia.,M,51,3  days.5 MG 1X D,3/21/2014,Cogentin

3, 3, Involuntary movements from  haldol,Just pure sleepiness_ and slowness!,"I am taking it for about 1-2 weeks because the ER doctor gave me an injection (via ""rear"" muscle _ OUCH!) on 02/18_ for a HEADACHE! That was an anti psychotic_ very high in potency tranquilizer. Not for me_ and I was left sleeping for two days and having RLS_ and my tongue was tightening up.. I was also repetitively saying ""something is wrong"" like a broken record. I now have to take Cogentin to eliminate these uncontrollable movement_ after only one does of Haldol. So far_ day two (too soon to give more info) It did it's job_ but I still feel slightly restless. Not everyone reacts to the same meds the same way.. but for me_ it calmed me down and made me feel REALLY relaxed.",F,,14  days1mg 1X D,2/24/2013Email,Cogentin

5, 1, side effects of risperdol,horrible_ couldn't think_ couldn't move_ release me from delusions that mental health professionals were intelligent creatures. I was wrong-the devil advocates they are.,Psychotic psychiatrists at Benedictine Psych in Kingston_NY said I suffered from delusions_ rage_ explosions. I agreed so I could get out of the hospital & to take defense. These nut doctors are horrible. /what are they talking about?Some crazy alcoholic claiming to be my father said I must leave my wonderful career and work in a dusty_ dirty factory as a favor. said I was delusional about crimes against me. Horrible drug-how is a pill suppose to change the past reality. Make the psychiatrists eat this for breakfast. Thanks for a lost life. My apologies to all for ever manufacturing these poisons. Poison_ Poison and more Poison. Is this a real psych drug????,F,58,5  years1mg 2X D,9/28/2012,Cogentin

7, 2, side effects,Lost my eyesight for seeing near. I've discontinued taking it and I still can't read my mail or a book.  I even got reading glasses and they help some_ but it's still blurry. Also_ dry mouth.,Great for solving my akathisa due to another med.  But the side effects are a deal breaker.  They're awful. That said_ I'm sensitive; if a med has side effects I'm sure to get them.  So other people might not even get these side effects.,M,38,2  weeks 1X D,3/5/2012Email,Cogentin
8, 4, akathisia from Latuda,Dry mouth!  Like someone else said_ it makes it hard to eat.  I have to take a sip of water with every bite in order to swallow.  Also_ ringing in my ears now and then.,This is a TERRIFIC med to treat Akathisia.  I was having night time restlessness from taking Latuda_ to the point that I couldn't stay asleep and wanted to crawl out of my skin.
