44, 1, ,The person who posted on 11/24 failed to mention that more fluoroquinolone antibiotics have been pulled from the market for their horrific and often permanent side effects than remain on the market.  And those that do remain (Cipro_ Levaquin_ Avelox & a few others) are NO safer.  It's also very difficult to sue for the damage done by this class of antibiotics because they are so sly; most of their damage evades medical testing.  Hard to sue when you cannot even prove what they've done to you.  Once a test is developed that uncovers the permanent cellular/DNA damage done by these drugs_ it's going to be a bloodbath.

46, 1, Bacterial infection,Yes this drug is really bad and can terrible side effects in some people.. but seriously billions of people have taken quinolones and 99.5% dont get problems. Only a few percent of people in clinical trials stop because of side effects.. for cirpo its around 1% and for levaquin around 3%. Most of those were due to nausea..tendon problems were not picked up on in clinical trials. Postmarketing reviews did find a slight increased risk and therefore there is a blackboxed warning. It also says not to take NSAIDs or cortocosteroids with them due to massively increased incidence of problems. Im not discrediting those who suffered side effects but just saying that they are rare. Flouroquinolones are the most prescribed antibiotics to adults in the U.S. If they were damaging everyone who was taking them (atleast 20 million americans a year) then they would have been taken off the market a very long time ago. There are so many other medicines that have terrible side effects_ but with those medi,If many people are getting damaged though from this drug_ to the point by which they say its ruined there life.. then there should be a massive classaction lawsuit. Get everyone effected together through a facebook group or something similar. If it is stated in the media that many thousands are looking for legal action due to life disabling problems from this drug the pharma companies will have no choice but to severely limit to use of flouroquinolones or pull them from the market all together. Listing the problems of these antibiotics on this site will not change anything.

I'm a week off of levaquin and the headache is now finally going away and my hand and arms feel normal again_ but I'm extremely fatigued and walking is difficult for me due to the pain and weakness in my leg.

Doctor kind of brushed that off as fluid retention (feet and legs are swollen). Seem to develop new symptoms daily and it's very scary to go downhill so quickly. Which specialist do you see for all this when this drug has affected so many systems? I was never warned of these side effects although they were well known.

85, 1, Ear infection,At day 3 of taking this I had so much pain in my muscles from head to toe that I was nearly limping. But I was told of the tendon pain and potential rupture_ so I was expecting the pain and stupidly continued through it_ assuming it would stop once I was done with the 2 10 day rounds of this_ one round for an ear infection_ and another round to get ready for sinus surgery. The 2 10 day rounds were about 2 weeks apart.By the end of the first 10 day round_ I could barely walk. After stopping that round of Levequin_ the pain settled in my left hip.  I went back to my exercising. Stretching. The left hip pain resolved about 50% although still noticeable. 2 weeks later I was prescribed the next 10 day round to prepare me for sinus surgery. By day 2 I was limping. By day 3 I could barely walk. I should have stopped. I thought that it would just affect me while on it_ and since 50% of the residual hip pain resolved with 4 workouts_ that when I was done and able to work out long term that it would resolve 100%.Days 4-10 of my 2nd 10 day round were terrible. It took me a very long time to stand up_ and when I got to standing_ I had to limp and stay off the left hip because it felt like it was going to rip in two if I put any weight on it.I stopped the Levequin after the 10 day course_ had my surgery_ and tried to resume workouts and life. Workouts have not helped_ and eventually it has gotten to where I cannot workout because the hip is too weak and when I do my entire low,Please don't take any of the Floxacin class antibiotics. Maybe you won't be one of the 1 in 100 affected anywhere head to toe (NOT just the Achilles tendon)_ but maybe you will be.

Extreme/severe joint pain_ high spiking fevers_ night sweats_ light and sound sensitivity_ body rash - symptoms lasted for 4 months after taking only 2 pills.

I also still have 5 finger joints that are swollen and look like an arthritic old lady even though I'm only 43.  So every time I look at them I get to remember what happened to me back in 2007 when I was 35...,DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG unless it is a last resort and you have to choose between taking Levaquin and dying.

Now I have a rash at the worst places that I had pain.,I was told by the pharmacist that I was not in a risk group for tendon problems WRONG. It's so true that it only takes 1 pill to knock you off your feet_ literally. I haven't been able to walk in 2 weeks since taking my last pill! The reviews here aren't exaggerating. On my 7th pill I started to get mild pain in one Achilles tendon that came and went very quickly. I took my 8th pill and wham_ some of the WORST pain I've ever felt in my life. From my knees down my legs felt like they were on fire. The pain was deep and everywhere.I had to keep my legs elevated for the least amount of pain.Someone told me to take massive magnesium when I was on levaquin to prevent the tendon problems. WRONG AGAIN. I took it_ even before the levaquin_ to make sure I had enough in my body. This DID NOT prevent the tendon problems. I've had to have groceries and everything delivered to my house. I can't drive yet. I'm getting better everyday_ but this has been a nightmare. I'm finally walking again_ but no shoes yet.Now there are rashes forming at all the joints where I had the most pain_ especially around the ankles.If there's any positive to this_ I do believe it batted back the infectionApparently levaquin kills bacteria by altering its DNA_ but what they don't tell you is that it can alter YOUR DNA and mess up the instructions for healing and cell replacement.

It is almost constant in my calves_ feet_ and legs. Joint pain in wrists_ hands_ and ankles. The earliest symptoms have subsided for the most part. There is still some insomnia but it has improved.

127, 3, Severe Bronchitis/RLL Pneumonia,After taking Levaquin for 7 days_ I experienced bilateral hip pain that awoke me several times during the night. Hip pain continued over the next few days and intensified-would rate it -7/10 on numeric pain scale.  Minor side effect began after taking Levaquin for 5 days. I noticed my tongue began to burn and feel extra sensitive. Within 24 hours I noticed a whitish coating on the soft palate and tongue. One of the side effect of Levaquin is thrush! I took acidophilus tablets and ate lots of yogurt to help clear this up! It took almost two weeks for the sx to subside.,I am 50 years old_ a runner (15-20 mi/week) and workout consistently using P90X3. The unexplained bilateral hip pain concerned me greatly so I did some research on Levaquin. I was unaware of the warnings/risks I taking Levaquin nor were they explained to me by the MD. I took extra strength Tylenol for the pain which helped and the severity of pain decreased over the next 4 days. I decided to stop running and concentrate on gentle hamstring strengthening/stretching. After 2 weeks_ I began running again but continue to have tight hamstrings and occasional bilateral hip pain. I have NEVER had any of these sx before and attribute the adverse effects of Levaquin for my unexplained bilateral hip pain and tight hamstrings. Note all side effects/adverse effects/Black Box warnings prior to taking any medication.,F,50,10  days500mg 1X D,7/30/2014,Levaquin

Have been to the point that I can barely walk and bear weight on that knee.   Pain is now mildly in left knee and is running up my thigh and down my calf on the right one.    Insurance will not pay for an MRI on the knee to see if there are other issues (tear_ etc).   Will be calling an orthopedic to set up an appointment for evaluation_ and also going for a physical therapy evaluation this week.     I know I have joint issues_ and maybe this is just all coincidence_ but highly doubt it.   Just want the pain to go away so that I can get back to a normal previously active life that I had.   It has now been 4 days since my last dose of Levaquin and the pain is SLIGHTLY reduced_ but still not good.   Even taking Vicodin did not alleviate any of the pain_ nor did a prednisone pack.

Any activity will cause me to be fatigued_ especially the next day.  This drug MESSED ME UP!  You will be at a high risk of tendon rupture for months afterwards.

Stopped at day 9 when I read the side effects on the internet.  Pain was unbearable.  Moving to the side of my bed to rise up on to sit on bed was excrutiating and I was certainly vocal when pain was shooting through my body.  I week later after stopping_ pain level has subsided somewhat_ but still about a 7 on pain scale.  I've gone through some unbelievable pain via skiing crashes_ surgery_ etc_ but this was relentless_ brutal_ mindnumbing_ pain.  Knees still hurt when standing up from sitting.  Takes several seconds to rise to full upright position.  Sleep is unattenable since taking meds because ANY position causes pain.  Bought knee braces and that helps a little.

Initial side effects included diarrhea_ insomnia_ extreme anxiety_ chest tightness and tendonitis.  The insomnia was like none other I have experienced.  I literally did not sleep at all and felt ""wired"" and anxious 24/7.  After 5 days of no sleep and against doctor's wishes_ I took myself off Levaquin.  As the drug left my system_ I began to sleep for short bits of time (20-60 minutes)_ waking up each time with a ""jolt.""  It has now been 5 weeks since taking Levaquin and I still cannot sleep through the night...I get 3-5 hrs of sleep at best (and that is still in small bits).  Diarrhea stopped after getting off pill_ but even with massive amounts of probiotics_ my system is still not back to normal.  Tendonitis has improved but is still there.

The side effects started as waking up in the middle of the second night in a panic and racing heart. Then a few days later I was unable to walk due to pain in achilies. Next an overwhelming feelin of doom and dispair. And then the 30+ days of insomnia. Anxiety_ depression_ numbness/tingling on hands and feet_ constant mental fog and confusion. This stuff really ruined my life for some time!,Firstly DO NOT TAKE! And secondly if you have already taken this drug and are suffering_ I am sorry and my heart is with you. The good news is that 4 years out from my first dose I feel 99.9% myself again (luckily). It took about 3 months for the worst of the symptoms to pass and be somewhat functional again. It took nearly a year to feel mostly better and be functional. I know that seems like along time but just be happy that there is an end (probably). I believe Jesus Christ delivered me from the pain after a pleading prayer. He is God so there is nothing he isn't bigger than. Good luck!

Yet there are almost 2 thousand people reviewing this drug on this site and the average rating is 1-2%. They state that the risk of achiles tendon problems are less than 0.1 percent and that achilles tendon rupture is similar to the general population. How can so many people be in pain if only 1 in 1000 are affected. Do most people have no problems at all? I am just confused about this drug_ as it can cause so severe damage yet this damage appears to be very rare according to the ""clinical trials"". Are these trials bullshit?

Her tongue was swelling and her gums were sore. She passed away on 2/22 in her sleep. I think this drug contributed to her death. She had a lot of medical issues; COPD_ diabetes and high blood pressure. The doctor should have never prescribed this and the doctors at the ER should have taken this more seriously. She just turned 60 on 1/25 and not even a month later she was gone. They did not do an autopsy because her primary care physician signed off on the death certificate. I talked to her the Tuesday before she died and she said she had been having hallucinations and she was really depressed.

I have been dealing with extreme fatigue_ brain fog and bouts of anxiety ever since.  All new and unexplained since taking Levaquin.  I stumbled upon a blog about this drug and found I was not alone.  Levaquin has ruined my day to day well being and I feel duped by doctors.  Levaquin is now listed as an allergy for me and it should be taken off the market.  I just want to feel good again!,F,43,5  days? 1X D,5/9/2013Email,Levaquin
206, 1, Sinus Infection,This drug should be pulled off the market!!!  I only had a sinus infection and this drug is a last line drug for someone who is critically ill.  I was on the 2nd day of my 10 day dose and I started having a burning pain in my arm along with seemed like tendon issues.  I also had really bad pain in both of my knees and in my Achilles tendon.  Luckily_ for me I used to work for a pharmaceutical company and remembered that quionlones could cause tendon rupture in rare cases.  I called my pharmacist and he told me it was not rare and quite a few people have terrible tendinitis and torn tendons.  I stopped the drug immediately_ called my doctor and told him that I was reporting my adverse drug reaction to the FDA (Medwatch). It is two years later and I still have knee and shoulder problems on and off.  This drug nearly ruined my life and after research many people have had horrible reactions to Levaquin_Cipro_ etc.  this drug should be pulled as some of the other quionlones have been pulled,Be very careful with this drug and ask for another antibiotic_ unless you are critically ill. Also do NOT tak this drug with steroids as it makes a quinolone reaction much worse.  There are many posts/blogs on the Internet that are frightening regarding this class of drugs.  I now have a new ENT who said he never gives this to his patients for the reason that I stated.,F,55,2  days500 mg 2X D,4/25/2013,Levaquin
207, 1, pneumonia,Got this in the hospital after open heart surgery when there was a touch of pneumonia...on second day in middle of night left foot started tingling...doctor got called...blew me off...by morning right foot was also tingling...walking down hall_ my left foot felt like a block of ice and my left knee buckled...looked up this drug on this site and then went and saw the black box warning and FREAKED!!!  Insisted on another antibiotic and made the doctors quite irritated.  Over 2 years later_ and my left foot is halfway normal and my right foot healed overnight.  Got lots of acupuncture treatments to get it this far...hope someday to get all the feeling back in my toes.  This stuff is DANGEROUS and should be used only in life and death situations (not my case) and the doctors need to pull their heads out of the sand and stop denying patients' experiences!

217, 1, I had flu like symptoms,The next day when i got up I felt like every bone in my body was breaking. All my joints were popping and cracking. I could barely walk. My feet hurt so bad at night I had even worse insomnia. I tried to walk all night to stop from killing myself due to such pain. Day 3 I vaccumed for a few mins and felt a terrible pain in my shoulder. I said to my friend I think I just ripped my shoulder off the bone. My friends looked at me like I was crazy. I started having extreme charlie horses in my legs and arms. It looked like balls were under the skin moving all around. I was screaming in pain. Day 4 I took the dog out for a little walk around place and my knee buckled under and felt like it bent backwards. I told my friends again .,Oh my gosh the pain is so bad I think I just tore my knee in half. I called and went to 3 Dr.s over the next few days and no one ever said anything about Levaquin. The pain was so bad I hadn't slept on days and I thought I was going to die soon from the pain. I was crying all the time and my daughter thought I was nuts. I found out later after many surgeries I had ripped my tendon off the bones. I live in terrible pain. I have peripheral neuropathy  which is permanent. I need to have 5 disc repaired in my neck after receiving 3 rounds of injections for pain in my neck. My shoulder is still in bad pain after the surgery and hours of therapy. My back and hip is so painful it is hard to walk. I found out yesterday that i have numerous herniated disc in my spine along with a tear in my mid spine. At no time did my dr or pharmacist tell me that an antibiotic could destroy my life and most of all my life with my daughter_family and friends. I don't think that Johnson and Johnson would give this drug to their families knowing what they know. This drug is supposed to be used as a last resort. It was used on men and woman during the Gulf War and the poor victims were told they were crazy. I can't believe that they can just get away with hurting so many people to the point that they can no longer work or even function in life.They make billions hurting us with no recourse .

224, 1, Sinus Infection,"I'm allergic to the penicillins and sulfa drugs_ and now this. After the second dose I noticed how sore my right knee was feeling and it was swollen. I have had ""runner's knees"" which was extremely improved after taking glucosamine/chondroitin over the years only with occasional pain. But_ wow - after the 3rd day of Levaquin_ my R/knee was so swollen that I thought I must have injured myself somehow. I had trouble bending the knee. Then my left knee followed suit_ and then my hands and wrists. I have carpel tunnel in both wrists_ but noticed increased swelling_ stiffness and pain. I realized that it was probably the Levaquin causing this and stopped taking it after this past Friday.  I called the doctor yesterday (Saturday) to report this and he prescribed Biaxin for another 10 days instead. Levaquin also caused a metallic taste in mouth_ esp noticeable when drinking water. Today_ Sunday - only a couple of days since stopping Levaquin_ the swelling in my knees have gone down",Always take a good probiotic when taking antibiotics. Esp. as you get older_ your stomach has a harder time breaking down food due to less concentrated gastric juices_ so don't drink too much fluids during a meal - only enough to wash it down and drink most of your fluids between meals. Also_ antibiotics kill the good bacteria as well as the bad esp. in the small intestine_ so probiotics taken in between the antibiotic doses help to replace the good bacteria that you need in the small intestine and this will help to prevent or mitigate diarrhea and upset stomach. So important! PB 8 made by Nutrition Now! of Vancouver_ WA is gluten free and comes in Vegetarian and regular formula (not sure of the difference) but it's very good and reasonably priced (120 caps on sale for $15.99 at the Vitamin Shoppe in northern VA) and take 1 cap 2x daily compared to Sustenex which has a 30 day (1 cap per day) regimen at a higher price. Probiotics (PBs) good for kids too and we have always escaped loose stools and upset stomach while we take the PBs during antibiotics and for another week at least afterwards. Don't take antibiotics and PBs at same time or PBs will not be as effective.,F,55,4  days500mg 1X D,2/3/2013Email,Levaquin

First pain in heals(lasted 2 Months)_ next insomnia (2 months)_ muscle spasms (2 months)_ dry mouth (2 months)_ deppression (4 months)_ floaters in vision (1 year)_ personality change/depersonalization (1 year with steady improvment)_ cloudy mind (1 year+)_ dulled sensation on skin (3 years). And wow were those terrible times! But after 2 or 3 months I noticed my first vast improvement_ and then at a year I only rarely noticed issues. Now Im 99% better_ just some scars from the memory of it happening!,I know the pain you are going through if you are a victim_ and I am sorry for you. This does pass. You have to try to do things that will make you happy and just be happy. Be patient and in the mean time find Jesus and ask for his help.Im not sure if any of these things helped but heres a few things that I believe may be good. I used milk of magnesia 2 tbs a day for two weeks_ switched my drinking water to reverse osmosis water only for 3 months_ and started using fluoride free toothpaste as well as peroxide for rinsing for 3 years. All of those things were myhts other people told me could help_ I think it did_ but if it didn't it was nice to feel proactive. Good luck my heart and prayers are with you.

My pharmacy has redflagged my account for Levaquin and any other drug in that family of meds.,I had taken Levaquin before and no problem so this just proves that drugs do rebound on you and you should always know the side effects and pay attention to your body when on a short term drug.

262, 1, Sinus infection,Right Achilles tendon ruptured the day after I finished Levaquin.  I was seated and stood up - the tendon ruptured during that simple act.The purpose in my taking Levaquin was to get rid of a sinus infection - certainly not worth the tendon rupture.,"The warnings the consumer receives about Levaquin are inaccurate and misleading.  If the accurate description of what Levaquin does to ones tendons were provided to me_ the consumer_ when I picked up the drug I never would have taken it.  Levaquin weakens the tendons and one should avoid strenous physical activity while taking it - had the warning said that instead of the current read of increased tendon rupture in people over 60_ etc._ etc._ none of which I fall into.  The amount of tendon ruptures from this drug is inexcusable - many people when they learn that my achilles tendon was ruptured ask me if I was taking levaquin - either they had the same experience_ or they know someone who had this happen to them or they are a medical professional and have seen it often.  The pharmacuetical company Janssen_ the maker of the drug_ is withholding important information about the drug.  I called them to ask them exactly how Levaquin affects the tendons to lead to tendon rupture and they refused to tell me_ yet they wanted me to provide them with my personal information.  I called them because on their ""online"" information about Levaquin it states that these spontaneous tendon ruptures can occur 3 to 4 months after finishing the drug.  Knowing this - and having my achilles tendon rupture from the mere act of standing from a seated position - I want to know how it affects the tendons so I can avoid more ruptures - the company refused to tell me.",F,53,10  days500 1X D,7/22/2012Email,Levaquin

293, 1, Throat Infection,This is a follow up review from one I posted a couple years ago.  I was given Levaquin for a throat infection that was made worse first by a doctor's misdiagnosis - Levaquin was highly recommended at the stage my throat was in.  While taking the drug I felt strange_ had some joint pains and bad feelings.  After taking Levaquin the ulcers formed in my digestive tract giving me painful bowel movements daily.  I also began to have joint pains and very painful acid reflux.  One time my arm swell up and ached so bad I thought my wrist was broken_ another time I randomly fainted and didn't wake up for a few minutes_ hardly breathing.  I had a few days that I felt like I might die_ cold and pale_ strange shivers and pains.  After about 2 and a half years now of ulcers in my bowels and a strange pain in the fundus region of my stomach_ along with random pains_ the doctors don't know what to tell me as they have been unable to find anything wrong with me other than the ulcers throughout my dige,Just a heads up if you are told to take Levaquin.  Don't take it any longer after your symptoms clear up.  Don't get me wrong_ Levaquin works very well against infections_ but this is also why it can hurt you worse than what it is trying to cure.  I have also heard that quinolones like Levaquin can change cellular DNA.  Based on my symptoms_ I agree.  Levaquin ruined my life_ don't let it ruin yours.,M,27,10  daysna 1X D,5/2/2012Email,Levaquin

Z pack_ and omicef do not work any more_ so I dreaded this drug_ and when you have fluid and green slime coming out of both ears_ you will try anything.  The first night it was hard to sleep_ but after that no major problems_ and it cleared up the chest_ sinus_ and ears.  My appetite decreased_ which was ok.  I tried avalox before and it made me feel like a zombie_and it might have messed up one of my skin tendons_ but no problem with this.  I do not know why there are so many scary reviews.

313, 1, Pneumonia,I was finally diagnosed with Pneumonia after several weeks.  By the time I was able to get in with my primary care doctor I felt like I was going to drown on my own fluids.  I was given a shot of the Levaquin in the office.  I was then prescribed 1 pill of Levaquin for the next 10 days.  I have to admit I  felt much better by Monday afternoon after having the shot. But today is Thursday (3 days later)  I was feeling much better when I woke up (other than a cramp I have in my right leg)  but within a few hours of taking the pill I started feeling funny again.  I can not stop sweating_ my mind feels confused_ I almost feel like I am in a fog and my leg still hurt.  I also noticed that I was having problems formulating sentences and reading. I just got off the phone with my doctor and she said for me to stop the Levaquin immediately.... she is calling me in a prescription for Omnicef.  I hope that I start to feel better tomorrow once this medicine works it way out of my system.,After talking to my doctor I looked Levaquin up on the internet and came across this site.

It is very unfortunate that the side effects out way the benefits for some individuals. In my opinion_ I feel Levaquin should be utilized for severe cases only_ after and only after_ all other broad spectrum antibiotics have been exhausted. This is a dangerous medication_ physicians should be required to give a pamphlet of information to the patients AND explain the possible side effects and what to report immediately to the doctor prior to the patient ingesting the antibiotic.

Attempted to do some yoga_ stretching provided temporary relief.Day 3: Tingly sensation in wrist_ and triceps. Woke up with a horrible dream_ heart racing_ sweats. The nightmares seem to indicate that the drug effects the central nervous system.Day 3: Ran to the Doctor's office to beg them to take me off this_ and to put me on the good old penicillin found in red wine barrels.

They gave me Zofran for nausea_ something to lower my heart rate_ and Ativan.  They asked if I had anxiety disorder_ I said no and asked if it was the Levaquin.  They said not likely.  I asked the Dr. on Tuesday_ saying I saw that these were specific side effects and they were bad.  He said unless my throat closed up or I had big welts_ to keep taking it.  I ended up back in the ER the next morning after little sleep the night before.  Finally_ the ER Dr. said to stop taking this.  No one in the medical world seemed to take me seriously until my second trip to the ER.  My boyfriend says sue_ but all lawsuits are based on Tendon problems_ I don't have that.

I consider it a miracle drug because within 10 days I was cleared to fly back home_ and within 3 weeks of having 2/3 of my left lung filled with fluid_ I was jogging again.   But for those who have experienced negative side effects...it is not often only the drug_ but the combination of the drug with your genetics and metabolism that come into play. Hence the need for pharmacodiagnostics to figure out whether or not you can tolerate a drug before taking it.

My last dose was on May 8_ so I have been dealing with the stiffness since then.   A couple people I read about had been helped by glutathione treatments administered by alternative medicine doctors (not covered by insurance).  I did the glutathione IV along with a modified ""Myer's Cocktail_"" once a week for six weeks (you can Google both glutathione and Myers cocktail for more info).  I did have improvement after the 4th treatment.  My 6th and last treatment was August 10.

I've also been depressed (not usual for me) and have had a lot of trouble sleeping. I am unemployed and trying for a long time to find work. I thought the depression and sleeplessness was from stress_ now I see that both of them are also symptoms. I feel cheated by the doctors who gave this to me without warning me of what could happen.

409, 1, Severe Sinusitis,I have been diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis about 8 years and take steroids and a TNF inhibitor. I was at the ER for a cat scan to rule out anything nasty during a severe sinusitis headache. It was sinusitis and I was prescribed levaquin despite my history/medications being thoroughly documented. By the 2nd dose I began to notice left calf pain and right Achilles tendon tightness. By the 3rd dose walking was becoming difficult and on the 4th day I was hobbling and struggling to go up and down stairs. I stopped the levaquin and was switched to Augmentin by my family doctor. Questions about whether this was a reaction to levaquin were discounted pretty much. Personally I don't think this is reactive arthritis or an allergic reaction. This is solely muscle pain that has me parking close to the door of my office_ limiting bathroom trips because it takes me so long to get there_ concerned about how I will do in an airport this weekend_ and indeed for the long term_ given what I have,,F,61,4  days500mg 1X D,7/26/2011Email,Levaquin

411, 1, Chronic Sinus Infection,I have taken courses of Levaquin (brand name) before with no serious side effects.  However_ this course of Levaquin (generic version) caused calf tenderness and swelling of my left knee and ankle after taking the 12th dose. I also feel tingling in my toes and some pain in my neck.  I was prescribed a 15 day dose by my allergist for my chronic sinus infection.  As soon as I noticed the soreness in my calves_ I immediately stopped taking the medication.  Then the next day my left ankle and knee began to swell.  I called my doctor to report my side effects_ and of course_ he told me to stop taking the medication.  He did prescribe hydroxyzine to help with the soreness.  We will see if it helps or not.  Also_ I still have the sinus infection (but for me that is nothing new).  My mom also had severe side effects after only one dose.  She had muscle cramps and soreness the first night after the initial dose.,I am very curious about the fact that the brand name version of Levaquin never caused side effects_ but the generic version did.  I don't know if there is any correlation or not_ but it is very interesting.  I agree with the others who have rated Levaquin_ stay away from it unless it is life or death.

432, 1, Bladder infection,Pain stiffness ankles - spreading to shoulders_ elbows and knees. Started within 24 hours.,Took this drug for a minor infection nearly five years ago.  Stopped after two days of terrible joint/tendon pain.  For the first year post  Quinolone  (Levaquin) pain and stiffness was chronic - moving from one joint to another - mostly legs and arms - bilateral.  Some days/weeks could not lift anything over a few pounds.  Also had sleep problems and nightmares. The pain and stiffness would remit for a week or two - then return - often in different areas.. This trend continued for a little more than a year_ then evolved in minor stiffness and mild aches for the next 3 years.  6 months ago it returned - worse than than ever. Now there is now complete remission of symptoms and it is spreading.  First began in right elbow tendons to wrist.  Then to the left elbow and now has spread to both knees.  Additional sporadic pains everywhere. Very difficult to knee_ lift even light objects (gallon of milk)l or climb stairs.Never had a joint pain in my life until a day after taking this poison.

433, 1, sinus infection/pnuemonia,I started to swell in  my joints to the point where my rings had to be cut off  when I  got to  ER.  My ankles  were so bad I  had  to  wear crocks and  I  got  weak and  almost flat in bed for two weeks before hospitalized for 3 days.  I was week and the pain was unbearable.  This was Feb/March of 2010 and I am  not over  it  yet.  Still have some swelling and lots of pain in shoulders_ muscles_ knees and hands. Drs. say it has to be  the  Levaquin.  lawyers say  I can't do a  thing. Even  tho  I expressed fear to the Drs. who gave it  to me.  So I  am stuck with hospital/Drs. bills_ plus I lost two  jobs. I died twice in ER. was in hospital  3 days.,I would not take this pill again if it was the last one on earth and they told me I would die without it.

After reading this website there's a whole lot more reasons for a lawsuit. I was prescribed Levaquin over the last 12 mos. Always worked except always symptoms returned. Took 6 times in 9 mos! When dr_ a GP_ prescribed he did so along with a medrol pack. Clearly says in the drug insert (just read recently) NOT to take Levaquin and steriods! Started experiencing side effects 3 mos ago. Went to a specialist who ran blood tests checking for Lupus_ RA_ etc. I already have 2 autoimmune diseases_ she thought I could have another one. Symptoms resemble that of many diseases including MS. All blood tests normal. Started reading about Levaquin. Found my symptoms were all same as side effects given. I told my GP_ he added in my chart can't take flouroquonoline antibiotics_ then prescribed a medrol pack for pain! Both my knees are shot. Had mri and have a torn meniscus/rt knee. I previously had no problems with painful legs_ knees & muscles. Now I can hardly walk my leg muscles hurt so bad. Beware_ always read the possible side effects insert before taking any drug! Levaquin's a dangerous drug & should only be taken in extreme cases. Be very careful I believe the side effects are permanent. I'm seeing an herbalist now. Trying the natural route.

461, 1, sinus infection,The doctor asked me if I took levaquin before said yes four times and never even burped from it. So he said it should help clear up my sinus issue it's very strong. On the fourth day I began to get cramps in my calves like nightime dehydration. By the eigth day I could not walk_ collapsed on a staircase and could not move for 10 minutes. I felt like someone was sticking a fat knife into the back of both calves and twisting it. Hobbled to the Dr. and he said stop the levaquin immediately_ I had no idea that could be the problem. Later went online and read about other horror stories. Could not walk for 3 days_ barely walk for a week after that. All in all as time went on I improved without the levaquin_ but it took a while to approach what I thought was normal.,Within 3 months started experiencing soreness and pain in both legs. Calves were tender when pushed on and the tendons were especially hurting to the touch. The treadmill became painful to be on. The discomfort was transient_ sometimes I felt better and thought I was truly improving. Then I started having pain in the tendons in my shoulders_ elbows_ knees and hips. Not real bad but always sore and aching. Now its 8 manths since taking levaquin and I'm really getting concerned because the constant soreness in my body won't go away unless I'm laying down or resting. And it's getting more intense. I can not walk any distance without experiencing substantial pain and weakness in my legs. Getting up from a chair has become painful and trying to walk after that is getting scary because of the weakness. They say take antiinflamatory meds but I take plavix so I can't. I've read people have had similar problems for years with no relief and I'm not in a good way about the prospects. I know this drug actually works miracles for some people who truly have no other options for treatment. So I don't think the drug should be taken off the market_ but it should only be used when the potential benefits outway the risks of the side effects. My doctor's intentions were good I took it before with no ill effects. I read it was developed as an antidote for anthrax posoining_ I haven't come down with that yet so I guess that's one good thing.,M,61,8  days500 mg 1X D,3/17/2011,Levaquin

That medication I believe contributed to my ProstatitisStarted taking July 20_ 2010.  Felt better the first week_ but it started the second week.  My feet suddenly got so hot_ I had to cover them with cold rag to be able to sleep.  Soon my big toe on right foot started hurting and down the line all my tows.   My left foot started the same signs about a week or two latter.  Three weeks after_ I could barely walk on my feet_ they were hot burning and hurting.

474, 1, Strep infection,At first_ the side effects I experienced were mild: slight dizziness and minor muscle and joint pain.  The side effects became more intense as I continued to take the drug.  The 8th dose sent me to the ER in an ambulance.  I felt like I was going to pass out and I had trouble breathing.  Three weeks after my trip to the ER_ the real fun began.  I began to experience extreme pain in all of my joints and tendons.  All of my joints began to pop and crackle.  I began to get chills up and down my legs accompanied by muscle twitches and spasms.  I was unable to walk or sit without pain.  I was unable to stand without braces on all major joints and could not care for myself.  I could not bathe_ dress_ or use silverware.  I was forced to go on medical leave as I was unable to perform my job.  An MRI revealed swelling in one knee with softened cartilage and stretched tendons.  In 3 months_ I have seen only minor improvement_ but continue to have pain in my joints and tendons and I have been tol,The only side effect my doctor mentioned was dizziness.  If I had known the long-term risk I was taking with my health_ I would NEVER have taken this drug.

475, 1, pneumonia,I'm a very healthy and strong 45 year old man- I was diagnosed with pneumonia and prescribed Levaquin due to its effectiveness against bacteria. I took one 750 mg pill and went to bed_ with no problems or pain other then my lung problem_ when I woke up I was a basically a cripple_ my lower back and left hip were locked up and swollen making movement and bending over nearly impossible_ a truly horrifing experience. I went to the ER yesterday only to have the Doctor and RN argue with me that Levaquin is not the cause of my suffering...they did relent and prescribe Augmentin as an alternative- 24 hours later I can dance a jig...don't try to tell me it wasn't this drug- If there are other options take them before this its just not worth it,,M,45,1  days750 1X D,2/28/2011,Levaquin

I had one occurrence of my hands and fingers going numb. I am very scared for the coming weeks.,What scares me is how many people have symptoms occurring weeks after stopping the medicine.

I'm an RN and after 3rd dose (after paying $140 for 7 pills) went to a different doctor and told him of symptoms; he took me off of it and told me never to take it again.  Talked to someone at work today who's sister has a seizure after 3 days of it (she had no previous history of this).

480, 1, Prostatitis,serious joint problems_ pains_ arthropaties,I believe this drug is very powerful against some infections in some cases_ as perhaps other meds of this group. My case seem to be not very optimistic in using it. I'm sure my current joint problems are because of it. I was first prescribed to use moxifloxacin year ago for 14 days and it was ok for me to take it_ though it didn't help to get rid of my sypmtoms of pain in prostate. Months after I've got knee problem and some other joint pains which I didn't correlate to the drug first but now I'm sure it's because of it. Now I'm on levaquin for nore than 20 days because of continued unknown prostate infection. Doctor said I should normally use it for 28 days_ but I'm not sure to continue as soon as I'm developing very unpleasand problems with my joints and that is especially unpleasant considering no effect on my prostatic pains. In general I'd recomment to very carefully evaluate it before usage even though others may not develop any side effect at all.,M,37,21  days500 1X D,2/23/2011Email,Levaquin

EXTREME pain (I have given birth naturally so I can say that). Released from hospital even though I was complaining of EXTREME shoulder pain. They told me it was from the IV needle??? While at home_ pain worsened. A week later_ spontaneously_ a tendon in my right shoulder ruptured. This hurt very badly and brought me to tears. Was unable to raise my arm/tricep muscle for 6 months-1 year. DID NOT HAVE SURGERY TO REPAIR TENDON. Doctors are clueless and cause more harm than good typically.

560, 1, possible bladder infection,severe lower body muscle weakness_ unsteady gait with knees buckling_ anxiety and insomnia_ difficulty with train of thought,"I feel it should be removed from the market!! Every physician and pharmacist I talked to about this reaction said it ""wasn't the drug"". I can't believe how uninformed these professionals are about these horrible side effects. And if they are not informed_ then we as the consumers do not get the whole picture before we take many of these terrible drugs. Now I realize (too late) that I have to do all my own research before taking any medication because the pharmaceutical companies are not forthcoming_ and the physicians do not take the time to investigate fully before prescribing these drugs!",M,57,7  days500mg 1X D,11/15/2010Email,Levaquin
561, 4, Prostate infection,minor joint pain in shoulders_ but I had joint pain off an on before I took it so I'm not convinced it had anything to do with the drug.  I had some minor muscle pain/fatigue after going to the gym the first couple of times and I did feel weaker_ but I attributed that to not working out for about 3 weeks while I recoved from an appendectomy.,My doctor told me of the possible side effects related to Tendon pain/tearing_ and suggested that I cut back on my weight that I was lifting by 50%_ I worked out the upper body 3 times a week with weights_ but did avoid anything that put extra tension on the achilles_ so I pretty much skipped lower body_ which was just fine by me.,M,48,30  days 1X D,11/12/2010,Levaquin

Taking Benadryl and hoping I got this out of my system fast enough.,I am a person who others consider tough - I had natural childbirth_ pancreatitis after my gallbladder was removed (and used very little pain medication) and have a very high tolerance for all kinds of discomfort - and this Levaquin SCARED ME.  The muscle pain and stiffness was worse than any flu_ and I have not been this emotional since I was perhaps 14 years old.

564, 1, Skin infection under elbow,Severe leg cramps. Severely swollen knees and ankles. Severe pain in knees_ ankles_ and wrists. Unable to walk or 6 months. Still experiencing side effects after nearly two years_,My symptoms started with multiple very severe night time leg cramps - so bad that I was afraid to get back in bed for the rest of the night. I then started to get arthritis-like knee pain. Walking was very painful. I could not walk more than 100 yards at a time. Conditions continued to deteriorate. Soon my ankles swelled like footballs. I could not fit into my shoes. I could no longer place my hands on anything where my wrists were unsupported. Then things got worse. I could no longer walk more than a few feet and had to use a wheelchair. The doctor tried to absolve himself by showing me documents indicating the dosage. He became very evasive. I returned to Canada and consulted my own doctor who prescribed complete rest with no physical activity until the symptoms subsided. I spent the summer of 2009_ from June to October in bed or on a recliner. I began to walk again with a cane at the beginning of October. Conditions improved in reverse order to the onset. My wrists improved by the end of July; my ankles returned to normal by the middle of August. By the beginning of November_ I found I could ride a bicycle. My walking continued to slowly improve. By June 2010 I was able to walk for about 20 minutes at a time. At the time of this writing I am able to walk for about an hour. Sometimes I get a sharp pain in my Achilles Tendon and end up limping. The muscle cramps continue with greatly decreased intensity. The cramps happen at night. This drug is a poison and should be banned.,M,64,14  days500 1X D,11/9/2010Email,Levaquin

I've always been prescribed Z packs for my sinus infections by my regular doctor.  Today I had to see another doctor because my regular doctor wasn't available.

Didn't sleep as well as normal.,The nasty infection in my leg went away with the drug.  I was on two other antibiotics prior to this one and they did nothing to cure the infection. Some of the side effects could be attributed to the fact that I had a severe ankle trauma and was going through major healing during the same time I was taking it.,M,45,40  days750 MG 1X D,10/25/2010,Levaquin

577, 3, Chronic Sinusitis,I was on it for 10 days for a sinus infection and I had very bad stomach pain_ insomnia so bad that I barely got an hour of sleep all night. I had vivid dreams that would wake me up. Also a few days after ending this medication I had neck/shoulder pain so bad I had to see a chiropractor. I have had pain in those areas before but never so badly. I had to use biofreeze with constant ibuprofen for 2 weeks and symptoms have still not full subsided. I also experienced intense chest pain_ hot flashes for no reason_ mood swings that are awful. I already have anxiety/depression issues and this only made my emotions more unstable. Sometimes I would experience symptoms related to RLS when I tried to go to bed with tingly pins and needles feelings.,I was first prescribed this medication at 17 because of my chronic sinus infections. After being on other antibiotics such as Amoxicillin_ Sulfa medications_ Cipro_ pretty much everything else but the doctors decided to prescribe me this because it was the only thing that killed the infections. I was told that it had serious side effects and shouldnt be taken often. I have HAD to take this medication probably about 10 times since that age and I am now 20. I have never experienced any adverse side effects until this current dose. I know this medication is usually prescribed for older patients_ which scares me because I am only 20 and have to take this medication.It has just been terrible and even though the 10 day dose did not fully kill the infection I know it does work well. I had to get another prescription for 14 days to try and kill the infection again but I gave up on it after reading all of the bad patient side effects on here and I need to find something else to help me. I would not recommend this medication to anyone who does not HAVE to take it. It should be a last resort.,F,20,10  days500 1X D,10/21/2010,Levaquin

584, 3, Throat Infection,End of August 2010: I was perscribed Levaquin (1 per day for 10 days) because of a strange bacterial infection in my throat.  I had been misdiagnosed by the first doctor I visited_ who gave me amoxicillin for strep throat.  First off_ Levaquin destroyed the bacteria and after the first day my throat was back to normal.  I did feel short of breath and had some random nerve pains throughout the ten days.  On only one day I had pain in my heel but that went away.  By the end of the 9th day taking Levaquin I was tired of it but the doctor told me to finish the perscription through the 10th day.  On the 10th day I started to get diarrhea_ cold chills and stomach/intestinal cramps.  It is now mid-October and I still have these symtoms.  I have been avoiding going back to the doctor again by eating Activia yogurt and taking Align Probiotic_ both of which help but obviously aren't fixing the problem.  I am going to the doctor this week to make sure Levaquin hasn't given me some form of colitis,Levaquin did what it was supposed to do but also gave me side effects that have lasted almost 2 months since taking it.  Levaquin is a VERY powerful antibiotic_ you can feel it in you moments after taking it.  Many people experience strange and uncomfortable side effects that aren't considered by doctors to be unusual.  Personally_ I will not take Levaquin again if there is another option.  From all the stories I've read of people taking Levaquin_ I'm not so sure this drug should be available or FDA approved.  IF YOUR DOCTOR TELLS YOU TO TAKE LEVAQUIN_ ASK FIRST IF THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION.,M,26,10  days500 MG 1X D,10/16/2010,Levaquin

There's probably even more things but these are the one's that bugged me the most. Oh yeah_ that same morning my other ear (the right one) was infected too so now I have hearing loss in both ears.,My doctor must be getting something from the drug company for pushing this on his patients.

586, 1, UTI,I am a runner. I was running 35-45 miles per week. After taking Cipro in May_ I started having pain in right ankle tendon in June. I also started having ringing in ears. I was prescribed Cipro again for another UTI in August_ saw black box warning and stopped after first day. Ankle pain got extremely bad_ had to cut running down to 15 mi per week.,Horrible drug. Had to go to Podiatrist and had to cut running down to 6 miles per week. This started in June and even with ice_ rest and milage cut backs_ I am still having pain in tendon. I never had tendon pain ever before this_ and have been running for 30+ years. Podiatrist confirmed that tendonitis was Cipro related. I am currently taking vitamin supplements_ and continueing to ice.  I am increasing running by 10% each week_ but healing is very slow. I have continous ear ringing as well. Avoid this medication.

My family doctor stopped Leviquan on the 17th day and said my symptoms were related to the medication.  He told me he hoped and prayed my symptoms would improve.

589, 1, sinus infection,Persistent muscle weakness_ tightening_ burning_ tingling_ joint pain that is crippling.  My body cannot handle typical physical activity such as walking and standing. I am in constant pain and my ankles/achilles/calves are perpetually swollen and not functioning properly. Acute shoulder weakness. Initially I was so dizzy_ I had to  crawl_ had no energy_ pain all over my body_ acute muscle weakness and joint pain_ ringing of the ears_ depression_ lack of ability to focus_ racing heart and hyper/nervous feeling while at the same time being severely exhausted.,This drug has robbed me of my life.  Most everything I do revolves around being active.  I am desperately trying to find people and treatments that can help me.  I found a paper written by Dr. Greene from Emory University in 2002 re: a physical therapy program she designed for someone who had a similar issue.  It required the man to be on crutches_ she made special achilles braces for him and it took approximately 5 months to get him better.  The school was going to do research on this several years ago however_ as it required costly ultrasound imaging_ the funding was not available.  If anyone has found a treatment or practitioner that has helped them_ please please email me with information. Also_ perhaps if there's enough interest in more research and enough people contact Emory University (or another)_ perhaps they will find a way to do the research and help those who have been affected.  I'm told the drug company has not followed people with longer term side affects.  They don't know why it has this affect and they don't know how to fix it. Research to find help must be required.,F,44,4  days750 1X D,10/2/2010Email,Levaquin

603, 1, Bronchitis,Irregular heartbeat_ extreme anxiety_ insomnia_ tingling on skin_ erratic mood_ crying jags,This medicine scared me...  I was never 'scared' of anti-biotics before this.  The skin tingling and irregular heart beat was frightening but the insomnia and anxiety was hellish.  I stopped after only one day.  I was up the whole night_ sleeping an hour at most_ waking in full of fits of terror_ certain that I was going to die.  I clung to my fiance and had a literal sobbing fit when he said he had to leave for work the next day.  The anxiety and fear was so bad I was terrified to be alone.  (I've NEVER experienced anything like this)...  He was so concerned at my odd full on meltdown (which I'd never had one before) he took me straight back to the doctor where I was taken off this drug.  I would also suggest this as a last result.  I have had lasting anxiety even a week later...  I still fear being alone at night (never felt like that before) and my thoughts feel disrupted.  I am not sure how to explain my state of mind...  it does not feel 'at peace' just this looming feeling of discomfort_ something not being right.  This drug is terrible...  I hope I return to normal after taking this.,F,29,1  days500 1X D,9/17/2010,Levaquin

This is a strong drug which can cure difficult sinus infections not responsive to other antiobiotics.  Doctors often prescribe it (with caution) along with prednisone_ which reduces inflammation in the sinus tissues and thus allows drainage of the bacteria the Levaquin kills.,Yes_ this is a powerful drug_ and yes_ some people are allergic to it or have bad side effects.  However_ the same can be said for nearly every drug on the market today!  How many people out there are allergic to aspirin?  How many people's stomachs kill them if they take one aspirin?  That doesn't mean that aspirin should be removed from the market_ simply because NOT EVERYONE is allergic or experiences negative side effects.When you are prescribed ANY DRUG_ it is your responsibility to read completely the patient information in the package.  It is also your responsibility to tell your doctor if you have any misgivings about taking a drug BEFORE YOU TAKE IT.  So many of the people who have written comments note that they didn't KNOW before they took this drug that it could have serious side effects.  Are you kidding?  Why would you ever put a pill into your body before you know what it could do if you are allergic to it?  That's why pharmaceutical companies are required to put out the patient information - so you can read it and make an informed decision about whether or not you wish to take the drug.  A lot of people are allergic to peanut butter.  Should the FDA ban it?  Many people are allergic to shellfish and nuts.  Should the FDA ban them?

Who knows_ by the time I'm 30 I could have 5 more tendon or ligament ruptures. 61% of tendon ruptures in the US are caused by levaquin_ so if you have a tendon rupture_ it was probably because of levaquin_ whether you're taking it or not!My mom perscribed this to me.

644, 1, Urinary Tract Infection,At first_ none. My urinary tract infection symptoms began to clear quite quickly and I was a happy person. Knowing how important it is to continue and finish any antibiotic_ I did. Within one day of finishing the course I began to feel cramps in my legs. That evening the cramps were severe. By the morning I could not walk. I called my doctor who instructed me to get to the hospital. I could not even stand up_ at that point we called the ambulance. Once in the hospital the doctors took x-rays and sonograms to find that many of the my tendons in my legs had either become detacted or were in the process of being dissolved at the attachment points. I went through two days of massive fluids in the hospital to flush my system. Reconstructive surgery was scheduled and performed on my ankles. Rehab took an additional 2 months. The final result as documented by the doctors: Tendon destruction as a result of an adverse effect from a Quinolone-derivative antibiotic. Come to find out this warning,I have since learned there are several class action law suits for Levaquin_ Cipro and other quinolone-based antibiotics.

It was like I had developed a rheumatoid arthritis type problem and traveling sprain feeling in different parts of my body.  Over the next few days some got better some didn't.  It has been a year since I took it and my right ankle_ although better still has a tendon that feels sprained.  I guess I am stuck with this forever.  Glad I did not take the full 10 days_ I'd be crippled by now.

Within a few days_ I was a crying mess. I have never experienced anxiety at that level. I could not stop moving. I paced around my house. If I did sit down_ I experienced what seemed like RLS. I was so tired_ but I couldn't sleep. I'd wake up at 3 in the morning and start pacing around my house. One night_ I walked for 3 hours straight. I got blisters on my feet. I have been unable to get off anti depressants. I told my doctor when I took it that I thought Levaquin was causing these feelings. They didn't seem to understand why. My thoughts were coming at a mile a minute_ I could not stop thinking. Every moment of the day was spent in a hypersensitive state. There was no relief to the agony. How I didn't end up committing suicide is a wonder.,F,46,10  daysforgot 1X D,6/16/2010,Levaquin

He was right about both.  I was amazed that a formally active and happy ""young"" 65 year old who hikes and rides her horses was relegated to trying to get comfortable_ somehow_ on the couch!  Quick acting?  You betcha....the second of seven pills created pain first in my knees that I brushed off as Springtime Gardener's Pain.  I was a FOOL to wait until my sixth dose to stop this poison.  Two MD's_ a PA and a Senior Pharmacist have ALL told me it is a reaction to the spider bite.  I might agree if there had been fifty or so spiders all taking a bite out of me on different parts of my body (joints) at the same moment in time.  It is a Big Pharma Whitewash.  WHAT ELSE WILL THEY DO WITH ALL OF THIS CLASS OF RX THAT IS STOCKPILED FOR THE MILLIONS SUPPOSEDLY AFFECTED BY ANTHRAX_ BIRD FLU AND H1N1?  Oh_ yeah_ that's why they keep pushing/selling it to us.

I just finished a 10-day round and I can't say I feel different in my sinuses - didn't feel them to begin with. During the 10 days I have felt really tired and my head has been pounding.

I didn't fall under any of the risk categories and have allergies that prevent me from taking other meds though. I had very mild side effects but I followed the instuctions and ""how to use"" guide to a T. And yes I am lucky I was not allergic. Being allergic to penicillin I would never come on a site like this and ask for penicillin be pulled from the market. Or tell people to stop using. Everyone reacts differently. But for goodness sake if you took this drug having high risk factors or because a doctor made a mistake_ don't blame the drug! For the first time in months_ I am pain free b/c of this drug. If no risk factors and have allergies that prevent you from taking other strong antibotics_ I highly recommend this drug.",F,48,10  days500 MG 1X D,6/7/2010,Levaquin

Levaquin stays in your system for much longer than doctors and reseachers are aware of.

It has been nearly three months for me and i just recently have seen dramatic improvement. I am sleeping without meds_ i can walk/run (with slight pain)_ I'm happy again_ and just about normal again... My only advise is to find god_ go to church_ surround yourself with happiness and hope. This helped the most actually. I also took two table spoons of milk of magnesia for two weeks since it can bond with the levaquin and help in the removing process.

My local pharmacist eventually told me what the emergency doctor SHOULD have!

I pray we find a solution to this poison and the havoc it has wrecked on him.  This is very sad.  This drug should only be used as a last resort when all else fails and it should never_ ever be subscribed to anyone who is elderly_ has a compromised immune system_ is on steroids or is a transplant patient.  I just wished we had not trusted his doctor of eight years and had done more research.  The man had always been very conservative when prescribing medication.  This is devastating.  If he's able to return to work it will be a miracle. Our whole family is beside themselves.

I cannot recall any major side effects worth mentioning except maybe loose bowel movements[to be expected with all the damage to the good digestive bacteria] I just finished a 14 days regimen of Avalox and it didnt cure my current infection. I'm about to start a 10-14 day 750mg/day Levaquin treatment and looking forward to it. It has always been successful for me in curing my sinus infections. The real problem is polyps blocking my airways. Bacteria get trapped and cannot drain properly. I have found Levaquin most effective used in conjuction with prednisone. The prednisone targets the inflammation while the levaquin targets the infection. The one-two punch clears me up wonderfully. I dont ever recall any acute tendon or muscle pain_ but I am not a very athlethic individual so I dont find my self exerting myself as much as some some may [I'm 6'3"" 235 lbs and average build]. I recommend it if nothing else has worked but I too like many peopele an concerned about the long term effect it may have on my bones & tendons.

I pushed through my fatigue_ but kept the workout light (less weight _ etc).  Within about three hours a painful knot began in my back_ and by end of day I was in extreme pain.  Now reading about this drug_ I am SHOCKED it would be prescribed for anything less than a life threatening illness.

There are other antibiotics that can fight infections.  Everytime someone takes this medication_ they are rolling the dice for possible PERMANENT injuries.,M,80,6  days500 1X D,5/1/2010,Levaquin
686, 1, Epedidmytis,I took this drug between 10 & 11pm fell asleep after 1am and woke up around 2am miserably hot and had to turn the AC up. Had to get up to urinate which I never have to do in the middle of the night ended up going number two as well. Turned the AC up even more. Went back to bed. Couldn't sleep. Still hot and became restless. Everytime I started to doze off_ I would immediately shake into being awake. A couple times I would hear a quick buzzing in my ears with nothing there to cause it. Around 5ish I might have dozed for a brief period but awoke again nonetheless_ miserably hot still and have to pee again and once again having to defecate. Turned down the thermostat once more and went back to bed. Still can't sleep and notice an increased heartbeat and anxiety soon to follow accompanied with a tight feeling in the chest. Ended up having to take a clonazepam just to make the anxiety subside.  I refuse to take Levaquin again_ even after 1 dose.,I feel that any drug that has side effects that by far outweigh any good they do_ should be removed from the market. Especially with all of the other adverse effects others have experienced.,M,30,1  days500mg 1X D,4/30/2010,Levaquin

I still can not play guitar a year after taking it.This drug has very adverse side effects that I do not believe the manufacturer even fully understands. It did clear my sinus infection up_ but with the way it has adversely effected my life_ I would never take this antibiotic until every other kind has proven ineffective. This is the only pill I have taken in the last 2 years period.  I am a relatively smart and halthy person_ IQ around 155. Since taking Levaquin_ I have had periods of insomnia_ a general feeling of dull mind_ not able to concentrate fully on tasks at hand_ general tiredness_ shortness of breath... and I think that it is all related to Levaquin.If you value your quality of life_ and this isn't the last resort antibiotic for your survival_ then I would,Never take it again.... ever.,M,40,21  days750mg 1X D,4/29/2010,Levaquin

These pains worsened and took months to go away.  Had to take it again and got depressed and lost almost all desire to have sex.  Lost a lot of desires actually_ didn't care about much.  Didn't even clear up my infection until the last couple of days or so.  I wouldn't recommend this drug because I think it does more harm than good.

I am a very happy_ healthy 45 year old man who takes great care of myself.  I am very active and eat right.  I have never had an issue with depression or a thought of hurting myself until recently.  How is this possible that this drug can cause depression.  From day one I was crying and did not know why.  I told a friend that I felt like I had cancer and my Bones hurt and I wanted to die.  I could not care for myself.  I just kept taking my Levaquin so I would get better.  I lost 12 of my 175 lbs in a week.  I had to think about where to place my feet as I walked.  I had headaches and I normally never get headaches.  I had shooting pains in my feet_ legs and back.  I was tired and could not sleep.  Dreams of car accidents and death when i did sleep.  Repeating songs all night long. I am the type of person that has dreams that make me wake up laughing so hard my stomach hurts.  What is this stuff? I am mad about what happened to me and will tell everyone about it even though it makes me sound like i am mental.  I do not want one more person in this world to take this crap.  Hopefully you are someone that will listen to all these people telling you to stop taking Levaquin NOW.  How is it on the market?  What is the FDA thinking and how do we get this off the market?  I personally will not take another drug in my life.  We are what we eat and I am good whole foods_ diet and exercise_ fresh air and no more pills.,M,45,9  days500 Mg 1X D,4/20/2010Email,Levaquin

695, 1, sinus infection leftover,Did not take after reading about it.  Had also been prescribed Prednizone at the same time - very dangerous.,I'm a good news story.  Thankfully_ I did not take Levaquin_ but I did spend the $50 copay.  My doctor will have that deducted from my bill.  I had taken a 4-day Z-Pac which usually works.  Didn't help.  Did 14 days of Augmenten which should have killed everything within 3 blocks.  It didn't clear me up. Highly unusual since either of these drugs has always worked before.After a (clear) chest xray_ a CT sinus scan which showed a mild sinus infection (means I was on the mend by this time) and blood work_ the Dr. prescribed Levaquin AND prednizone.  Together.  1st- I'm allergic to Prednizone and it's in my chart.  2nd- if you read the warning label on the Levaquin_ these 2 should NEVER be taken together.  Truly amazing.  I think some doctors simply don't know what to do with a patient_ so they 'throw something against the wall' to see if it sticks.  I also had tried to talk more with the pharmacist when I was buying the Levaquin at Walgreens_ but he didn't have time for 'more questions'.,F,58,14  days500MG 1X D,4/19/2010,Levaquin

697, 1, respitory infection,Started out with loss of appetite after 1 day_ by the 3rd dose I was having chest discomfort and muscle pain like I have never experienced before along with increased muscle pain.,Always do your homework before taking any new drug!  If I had read the side effects prior to popping out a $50 copay_ they would have never gotten my money_ but when you have felt like death warmed over_ you will do most anything to feel better asap. In all honesty_ the reason for me taking it to start with did get better quickly_ but the side effects were not worth it.  Loss of appetite was a mixed blessing since I could stand to drop a few pounds anyway_ but I dropped 10 pounds in 3 days..still not too bad.  The bad part came in with an irregular EKG and chest pain that sent me via EMS from the doctor's office to the ER...this was on day 4. Prior to that I was starting to have muscle pain in the lower thigh/knee area...still didn't associate it with the Levaquin until day 5 when the pain increased in intensity and over a larger part of my body.  It now includes the both knees and thighs_ both wrist_ hands_ elbows and shoulders. I've been flat on my back for the past 7 hrs with a heating pad_ totally exhausted_ heavy duty pain killers and muscle relaxers haven't touched it.

When she said she had such bad muscle pain in her legs_ it made me realize that the pain I've been suffering with all week was from the medication!

700, 1, Sinus infection,Muscle pain all over_ achiness & skin sore. Also fatigue_ weak_ shakiness & rapid breathing... Have hard time catching my breath.,I am sure there is an appropriate use for this drug but it should be prescribed in only extreme cases. I am allergic to xithromax & to doxycycline so I think my dr wanted to try something different. With every drug you take risks_ but honestly I didn't know much about this one & didn't read the side effects. After taking 1 dose_ within a few hours I felt completely drained & my body was aching. I was hungry but don't want to eat. I kept thinking the aches & pains could be attributed to my sinus infection & jet lag from a business trip; however I usually bounce back quickly. Now it is the evening of the second dose & I am still aching & sore. I kept telling my husband somethings not right_ I had to take frequent rests while housecleaning which is not like me. I usually am a whirlwind of activity & never take breaks! I am only 39 & in good health. I thought a hot shower would make me feel better but it didn't & my skin was feeling sore. Because I've had hives before it dawned on me that sore skin is usually my first symptom of allergic reaction. So I read the medicine pamphlet & the mention of tendon &/ormuscle aches the alarms went off in my head. I got on google & started researching levaquin. I stumbled on this website & I realized that people were describing the exact same side effects I was experiencing. I am discontinuing the drug & calling my dr first thing Monday to tell him what's going on. I hope it gets out,F,39,2  days500mg 1X D,4/17/2010,Levaquin

However_ that was in Dec. of 2009 and 6 months later I am still feeling the effects of this drug. I can no longer bend down due to the severe pain in my knees_ can't run_ and working in my garden is too painful.  This drug has ruined my life.  Will the pain ever go away?,Why is this being prescribed for sinus infections? My dr. said this is a powerful drug and due to the severity of my blood infection that was why he prescribed it.

Given IV of ativan and three hours later my vitals QUITE SUDDENLY returned to normal with a BLOOD PRESSURE of 110/60.  Felt fine_ wanted to go home immediately.

713, 2, Sinus Infection,Headache_ dizziness_ irritability_ inability to concentrate,Taking Levaquin made me feel worse and did not seem to alleviate the severe sinus congestion I have been experiencing. Shortly after taking it the last couple of days with a full lunch_ I experienced extreme head pain right above my eyes.  I then had a very hard time focusing and concentrating at work and had to go home. My sensitivity to sound also got worse_ making any noise almost unbearable (although some of this can be attributed to my sinus infection). I am also a marathon runner who is running the Boston Marathon in two weeks_ and the risk of tendon damage from taking this drug added to my fear of continuing. I called my doctor and he switched me over to Augmentin_ which is in a different class of penicillin based antibiotics.

On the 5th night_ however_ I had a major panic attack over being congested and not being able to breath out of my nose.  I was incredibly fearful of not getting enough oxegyn and suffocating.  With the help of my husband and some yoga breathing_ I was finally able to calm myself down enough to fall asleep around 2 am.  But the following day_ I felt like I was on the verge of another panic attack and was incredibly weepy.  These are not conditions I have ever experienced.  This is not like me at all and after reading some of the comments from this sight_ I am going to discontinue use of my last few pills.

I don't always remember what I just did (ex - I took a laundry basket downstairs_ got a drink of water_ then went back upstairs to get the laundry.  I was surprised to find it wasn't there and had no recollection of taking it downstairs).

I HAD NAUSEA ALL DAY. I HAD DIZZY SPELLS. MY URINE WAS DARK. MY APPITITE WAS GONE UNTIL LATE AT NIGHT. I HAD STABBING CHEST PAINS.

741, 1, Bronchitis & sinus infection,Took this along with Prednisone & Benzonatate over a year ago. Only immediate side effects while taking medicines were dizziness_ diarrhea & sleeping around the clock. It *did* get rid of the bronchitis - which I had been taking other antibiotics in the 2 months prior to the Levaquin prescription.,The side effects *after* completing the regiment of meds have been extremely detrimental to my overall health. Within 1 month I had gained 25 lbs (Prednisone) and I was losing muscle mass. I started working with personal trainers to regain the muscle mass. I have had varying muscle weakness for the past year and the body fat count % has continued to increase. The muscle weakness varies day by day & muscle by muscle. Lymph drainage is stymied & almost stagnated. It is only within the past month (12 months since completing the regimen of Levaquin) that my body fat % has started to lower (without any diet changes in the past years) and my muscles are responding to the workout sessions - I am actually starting to see muscle mass instead of increased jello-like muscles.,F,44,7  days 1X D,3/14/2010Email,Levaquin
742, 1, possible epididymitis,Intense leg pain and weakness; severe muscle wasting (lost about 14 pounds mostly muscle in legs) and pain in calves; muscle spasms in calves; tendon pain in achilles_ knees_ and points of attachment in buttocks; constipation; some hypoglycemia; some insomnia; pain in kidney area while on drug; headaches and neck pain; dry eyes.,I was very healthy and now I feel very weak_ old_ and in pain in my legs.  The symptoms started early in terms of weakness; I could not ride my bike because of weakness by day two or three on the drug.  I probably had pelvic inflammatory syndrome (because: a urine test was negative for bacteria; levaquin did not lessen the intense pain after the first few days or first week or so; I recently found that some family members may have this also; and a single cranberry pill at night reduced my pelvic pain by 50% overnight and this was around day 8).  By the time I realized that I was suffering from levaquin I had taken 12 pills.  I would be happy to share additional information via email.  I am looking for any treatments that might help and diagnostics of the damage. My doctor measured: creatine kinase_ SED_ potassium_ glucose_ magnesium_ and vital stats.  My potassium was high on the first test but normal after that.  My blood pressure spiked (I have never had this) and my heart rate was very high for me. I also wonder how long people have been suffering.  I started in the end of January and now it is March 14th.,M,45,12  days500 1X D,3/14/2010Email,Levaquin

This feeling subsided somewhat_ but has not left me yet_ and that was 5 years ago.  I am now on full disability_ mostly because of LEVAQUIN!  Of course_ doctors don't care about my Levaquin story_ they just make their psychiatric diagnosis and that's it - But I'm very much in touch with what happened to me.

After about 8 days_ I was much better and quit taking the cough syrup.  I noticed that my whole body hurt horribly.  It was milder when I was taking the cough syrup (which helped the pain as well) so I thought it was aches associated with being sick.  I have now been off of the Levaquin for almost 3 weeks and am still experiencing a lot of pain.  I have never had these issues before.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!,F,38,9  days500 1X D,2/28/2010,Levaquin

757, 1, recurrent bronchitis,sore tendons_ joints and muscles_ extreme anxiety.,I started feeling the adverse effects right after the first 500 mg dose. A couple hours after taking it I became very anxious and had to take an anxiolytic (xanax) to calm down. The only drug I regularly take is an antidepressant (Lexapro/Cipralex) which is usually enough for anxiety_ but not in this case. The following days I noticed my tendons_ joints and muscles were unusually sore_ as if I had run a marathon the day before. I'm 27 but I felt like I had become 70 years old overnight. I stopped taking the drug right after the first dose_ so hopefully I won't experience any more adverse effects in the future_ and my body seems to be slowly healing with time (some supplements might also have helped -- my physician recommended carnitine)_ but it's been pretty scary what damage a single dose has been able to do. I've been prescribed many antibiotics in the past for a recurrent bronchitis_ but none had side effects nearly as severe. I switched to an antibiotic I had used previously (Augmentin) and had no problems_ except mild stomach problems easily solved with probiotics.I would advise using Levaquin and other drugs of the same class (floroquinolones such as cipro_ etc.) only in very extreme cases_ when all else fails. BTW_ I'm in Italy and there is no black box warning here highlighting the possibility of tendon damage_ it's just classed as a rare side effect. Had I read the US PI sheet (let alone sites like this one)_ I would never have considered taking it.,M,27,1  days500mg 1X D,2/25/2010,Levaquin
758, 3, bronchitis and sinus infection,This is my first day off LEVAQUIN and i am still experiencing severe green diarrhea that has been going on since the second day of taking this antibiotic. No matter how much water I drink my body still seems to be dehydrated and no matter what kind of foods I eat _ i still experience the diarrhea. Also_ I have been having very vivid dreams that wake me up at night so sleep has been very limited.,Although the side effects were a bit intense on my part LEVAQUIN worked like it was suppose to _ I feel great other then the bowel movements and sleeplessness!,F,20,5  days750 1X D,2/24/2010,Levaquin

While on Levaquin I needed to reduce my insulin dosage because sugar levels were running very low_ from 49 to 60 after meals_ occasionally.,This did not occur after each meal but I check sugar levels often so I was able to correct the lows. Too bad I can't stay on Levaquin_ I wouldn't need insulin!  Happy with the drug. Sinus infection cleared up well.,F,62,10  days500 mg. 1X D,2/23/2010,Levaquin
760, 1, Prostate,"Response to the earlier post ""I am a DR"" - Well so am I.  I rarely take medications due to my knowledge of viral vs bacterial_ resistance etc.  I read the warnings_ but I am a young healthy guy with no comorbidities.",A side effect should be a temporary issue - loose stool_ rash_ etc.  This med effected my tendons quickly.  It was difficult the first day to distinguish between being really sick and the tendonitis as I was febrile with heavy body aches.  But_ by my second dose_ it became obvious I was suffering from intense localized tendonitis.  I could not grasp a cup and hold it in my hand.  I had extreme difficulty walking.  Although my hand strength returned within a couple days_ it was months before I regained my leg flexibility.  SO - It is easy to criticize_ I do it all the time_ but this med can permanently alter your life.  I had taken it once several years before without problems - I hope you are cautious if you find yourself in need of its help in the future,M,38,3  days750 1X D,2/23/2010,Levaquin

Low grade prostatitis symptoms disappeared in the first three days of using Levaquin and I thought it was a wonder drug; however_ the prostatitis symptoms returned on the fourth day and have been significantly worse (uncomfortably so) since then over the last 12 days.  I am not sure there is any benefit in taking Levanquin and wonder if it is having any effect on lowering my PSA level.

Possible high blood pressure_ palpitations_ GI upset_ Headache_ or possible spontaneous tendon rupture ARE mentioned in PI (product information packet).  Risk increased if taken with prednisone_ over age 65 or under 18.  Great antibiotic for the right patient.  ALL medications (even multivitamins) have potential side effects.  MD's are revered when you feel better_ ridiculed when you don't.  75% all bronchitis is VIRAL along with about 80% sinus infections.  Over prescribing antibiotics has resulted in Z-Pack having a 70% RESISTANCE RATE to infections_ not even to mention that taking amoxicillin is like taking sugar pill.

776, 2, sinus infection,It begins with severe pain in my ankle inside under the bone.  3 weeks later severe pain in the elbow.  The podiatrist says torn ligament and regular doc says tennis elbow/ bursitis nothing brings relief.  Also the knee is painful...I thought because of the ankle and walking weird to protect it.  These 2 areas of pain were on my mind the most but perhaps the silent killer was lurking for which my doctor is in shock and has no answer for.  I suddenly became a full blown diabetic with no previous indications.  Then I read the symptoms.. levaquin can effect your blood levels.  This is most likly the answer.. and he is the one who gave me this med.  It also is hard on the liver.  and my doctor already knew that I have had some liver problems.  On 12/30/09 My hemogloblin A1C was at 10.1 when normal is a 5! By the way.. this reading shows what WAS happening 3 months back! Hmmmm!   my finger pricking test daily showed 375  way high.

779, 1, Suspected sinus infection,Heavy head; panic attack; insomnia; wierd dreams about death; jittery_ uneven heart beats; nausea,"I was prescribed this drug by my ENT for suspected sinus infection. To add to my voes_ the drug cost me a fortune. My initial reaction was to walk away from the pharmacy_ but unfortunately I paid little attention to my 6th sense. The ENT was referred by my nuerologist whose judgement I value_ so I decided to go ahead.I was fine for the first couple of days. Then I started experiencing insomnia_ jerked woken up from sleep(on 2/5). I knew that to be 'panic/anxiety attack' and wondered why. I couldn't go back to sleep. On 2/6_ I developed heavy headedness. I was blabbering something meaningless_ had wierd dreams_ scary (related to death). I started getting paranoidical thoughts (in the middle of the night). I generally read before going to sleep and related my dreams etc to watching too much TV. But Sunday 2/7 was extremely bad. I felt my head like having BPPV_ jittery heart & nausea. I went to bed around 8:00pm with headache. I had difficulty falling asleep as each time my eye would shut_ I would be jerked awake. Then_ I was jolted wide awake by about 11:00pm. As I lay in bed wondering what was wrong with me_ I suddenly thought ""LEVAQUIN""!!! I jumped out of the bed and Googled. By that time I was 90% positive that all that I was going through was somehow related to LEVAQUIN. But I wanted proof. The 'official' site listed only a few symptoms. Then I hit upon this site. I am resolved not to take another dose of this drug. ",F,48,5  days500mg 1X D,2/8/2010Email,Levaquin

After amoxicillin not making me any better the doctor switched me to Levoquin. It makes one wonder how much the doctors know about the drugs they are prescribing! After the third day I could hardly walk when I got out of bed in the morning_ the next day was worse which made me wonder if it was a side effect.  I am angry that my doctor knowing my problems with many drug side effects and the fact that I have permanent nerve damage from the hip replacement and difficulty walking due to the pain would put me on this horrible drug.

Hand massager on my hips to increase the blood flow to the joints and the pain was less.  Heating pad for 20 mins. per area.  Of course the doctor said that it was not the Levaquin and I needed to have blood tests completed.  The blood tests were normal with just slight inflammation and slightly low vitamin D.  I was sent to a Rheumatologist like everyone else.  He said_ that it could have been the Levaquin or like my MD said the cause could have been the immune system fighting the infection in over drive.  So_ no rheumatoid arthritis but I was presribed a muscle relaxer for the back spasms etc....I waited another week and decided to go ahead and try the chiropractic treatment.  The doctor I use has seen similar cases due to Levaquin and I have had two adjustments along with a massage.  It has caused a different kind of pain like from working out.  I am drinking more water and the adjustments along with the massages are helping to alleviate the pain.  I have only been able to sleep on my back due to pain in my shoulders.  The chiropractor asked me to sleep on a pillow that was higher so that my shoulders would not roll in or over.  She said it would also help to use a body pillow or additional pillow while lying on my side to keep my shoulder from rolling forward.

I took it for the full course_ and after I was done I took high quality Kefir and cultured raw vegetables from the health food store_ these replenish the good bacteria that are required in your digestive tract_ antibiotics can kill everything and I find it very beneficial to reintroduce the pro-biotics to restore balance especially after a course of anti-biotics. I also did light exercise after I got better which I think helped minimize any side effects that others talked about.,M,42,7  days,1/2/2010,Levaquin
820, 1, chronic sinus infection,The first dose made it difficult to sleep_ my heart felt like it was racing. I felt anxious all day also_ this did not subside until I stopped taking it. Stomach upset was very bothersome. Headache was also extreme. The worse part is that now_ 3 months later I have extreme pain in my right achilles that hits especially in the middle of the night. Painful to touch and appears swollen. Not so bad during the day...Makes me wonder if it is okay to run during the day_ since I am an athlete and never had any pain in my achilles EVER!  I am afraid I might tear it or something. I work with an MD that said you can get the side effects months after taking it. I really wish I had checked with him before I took it. Also_ I have talked to others who experienced the same tendon pain and swelling.  Don't ever take it if you have a choice. I had to due to allergies to other meds. This medication definitely needs to be taken off the market!!!!! Why is is being used???,,F,40,5  days,1/2/2010,Levaquin
821, 1, Ear Infection,Anxiety_ obsessive thoughts_ trouble focusing_ sleeplessness_ dizziness_ tremors and a general jittery feeling.,"Got the perscription from a urgent-care type walk-in clinic. Gave up on the daily dose of 750 mg after 4 days. Went to see my regular doctor and she put it on my ""do not use"" list. When she checked her drug manual_ the second most reported side-effect was listed as CNS (central nervous system) stimulation. I think this is one of those medications that is fine for certain people but bad news for others. My wife took it a couple of years ago with no problems. I think it is probably not for anyone who has a history of anxiety or depression_ and there should be more warnings about this. Overall I would NOT recommend this medication.",M,55,4  days,12/31/2009Email,Levaquin
822, 5, Sinus Infection,Stomach discomfort,LOVE Levaquin. Never had an issue with it and it clears up my symptioms in about 2-3 days. I was taking 750mg once a day for 10 days. It is very stong medication and should be taken with food and lots of water. If you follow the directions and aren't so focused on the side effects_ you will be fine.,F,26,10  days,12/30/2009,Levaquin
823, 1, pneumonia,I was given Levaquin in the ER for pneumonia.  About 1 1/2 hours after taking it I experienced what seemed like a panic attack.  I had shortness of breath_ rapid heart rate_ nervousness_ diarrhea_ etc.  I did not sleep for over 2 days-even though I tried.  I felt like I had adrenaline pumping through me.,Do not take!,F,31,1  days,12/29/2009,Levaquin

Moderate to severe joint pain in hips and legs.  Exhaustion_ not much relief.  This stuff should not be on the market.  It's harder on a boy than just having bronchitis.  I am back to work_ but feel like I have been through the wringer with this medication.,I already have joint pain on a semi-regular basis_ but this stuff made it 10X worse.  I can't believe my doctor would give this to me knowing that I already have trouble that way.  For all the unpleasant side effects_ I had the sense that my illness was not improving_ but staying as it was when I started taking the medication.,F,40,5  days,12/28/2009Email,Levaquin
825, 1, sinus infection,I took Levaquin b/c other antibiotics did not work or made my stomach upset. Within 12 hours of taking Levaquin_ I got a debilitating migraine and my knees felt sore. I thought the pain was from working out b/c I am very active and athletic. I have never had knee pain before. After 12 days_ I can hardly walk. I am stopping today_ despite a chronic sinus infection.,My doctor didn't mention this possible side effect. It scares me that this pain may last up to a year or more.

I had been treated for UTI's for about 7 years on an almost monthly basis and this drug not only cured my UTI_ it cured a skin bacteria I had been fighting_ and cleared my sinuses.  All should be in tune to your body and if something doesn't feel right at the beginning_ then do not continue with the drug.

My hips also began to hurt so badly_ I could barely walk.  I also had bad knee pain.  This was not what I had expected to have happen from an antibiotic_  however_ the sinus infection went away.,I will never take this drug again.  It has been over a week since stopping this drug.  I do not feel much better pain wise and do not know if I will ever be able to work as freely again.  I sure hope I get well soon.

833, 1, Bronchitis_ followed by sinusitis,I was initially prescribed this drug for bronchitis after another antibiotic didn't work.  I started to experience extreme fatigue_ insomnia (even after taking Ambian CR) and severe pain in my back.  The pain felt like extreme bruising and a sever burning session but I thought it was from a cupping treatment I received in Asia.  About 3 weeks later I contracted sinusitis and was prescribed Levaquin again.  Just like the last time_ I am feeling extreme fatigue and back pain!  I am also feeling pain in my knees and I have never had that.  I am an athlete and can't seem to find the energy to even climb the stairs.  I stopped taking this after reading similar reports.  This drug is bad!,,F,45,7  days,12/23/2009,Levaquin

My hips are starting to be painful_ laying on either side at night has become dreadful. Nausea_ constant fatigue.  I never used to take naps_ now my eyes close often during the day_ waking up to find an hour sometimes 2 has gone by.  My taste-buds and sense of smell are completely off.  Foods/drinks I used to like I can't stand the sight of right now.  I am easily agitated.  Nervousness.  I sometimes feel like I am in a haze of some sort but I can't really describe it.,I was taking 750mg from Nov. 12th_ to yesterday_ December 22nd.  Once a day_ everyday.  Yes_ a very long period of ingesting this medicine.  But I had a very serious bacteria.  Started with being contaminated with Serratia_ then found in a 2nd culture that I also had pseudomonas aeruginosa_ then a 3rd culture found Staph.  All from surgeries.   While it may have killed the bacteria in my body_ it also killed my spirit_ what used to be a very high-energy life that I lead.  I am still recouperating but this is ridiculous.

I have stopped getting worse but am not getting better. great that fda issued a warning_ but would be nice if someone cared enough to figure out why this happens to healthy people and what to do about it!

When I took it last month_ I had severe nausea_ dizzziness and fainted.  I had no idea what caused this problem. I was rushed to the Emergency Room and I told the doctors that i had began taken Levaquin prescribed by my doctor.  They ran several test but they never associated it to Levaquin.  I took the five day dosage_ however I was still having issues with my sinuses. The doctor stated that she would give me another round of Levaquin for two weeks this time.  I started taking the Levaquin on Dec. 18_ 2009 and I experienced headaches and severe pain in my thighs when I go to bed at night and trouble sleeping.  I mentioned it to the doctor and she told me to prop my legs on a pillow and she would like to run bloodwork on Dec. 21_ 2009 to check my potassium level.  I decided to look on the internet before going to the doctor tomorrow to see if anyone else experienced similar side effects. After reading some of the side effects from others_ i definitely believe the medication is causing these issues so I deciced not to take any more. I have never experienced this type of pain before in my legs or thighs. I believe this drug needs to be taken off the market.,F,41,3  days,12/20/2009,Levaquin

843, 1, Bronchitis,I took one pill (500mg) and started feeling odd within about 15 minutes.  Over the course of the next 4 hours_ my tendons started to feel stiff to the point that I no longer felt comfortable moving around.  I am an athlete_ so I am very concerned about doing any type of damage to any of my tendons or ligaments.  I got in bed and slept flat on my back_ trying not to move much.  2 hours later I was coughing up mucus and could not sleep.  I took some Benedryl_ two tablespoons of activated charcoal (helps get toxins out - I felt like i had been poisoned) and went back to sleep.  Today I feel much better.,I called my doctor and he told me to stop taking it.  I think it knocked out the sickness to some extent - but it made me feel so terrible.

The good thing was that my nose infection was dramatically decreased.,This is a very strong medicine which must be used with YOUR CAUTION !!  Most of the time_ it is prescribed after Amoxicilin and Clarithromycin fail to get rid of the bacteria in your body.High risk_ high return.

Unconscionable.You can be sure the levaquin mfg has received nasty feedback from tens upon thousands of disaffected consumers' that not all is well with their Frankenstein creation.  Caveat emptor. We'll never know how many consumers flat-out died or became so incapacitated following levaquin ingestion that they cannot register a complaint.  If you follow the internet threads_ you will become astounded by the frequently-cited damage caused by fluouroquinolone antibiotics including levaquin and cipro.

Severe insomnia_ left knee swelling and pain_ difficulty walking_ feeling of detatchment and nervousness. I just found this site today after taking my last dose. I want to go and throw up the last poison pill in my stomach!,I'm really unhappy and scared as I was basically a healthy individual_ physically active but now I can't even climb stairs without holding on to the rail for dear life. I want my life back! I'm praying these side effects will diminish_ not sure where to turn. I don't want to get my MD in trouble_ but he did give me a handful of sample blister packs so I had no idea what the side effects were.,F,44,7  days,11/10/2009,Levaquin
868, 5, Chronic bronchitis,Lethargy_ aching arms_ stiff neck_ insomnia,I was given a 5 day course of the 750 mg. This after zithromaxdidn't help me for a big bad sinus infection and bronchitis. After a few days was feeling so much better.,F,43,5  days,11/9/2009,Levaquin
869, 1, Prostatitis,Disabling tendon_ muscle_ and joint pain and weakness all over my body_ lasting 6 weeks so far.  Major difficulty walking or standing_ or doing any normal activities. Sudden_ obvious increase in joints popping and cracking. Brief auditory hallucination.  Generalized itching.,One 500mg dose of this dangerous drug attacked every tendon_ from my jaw to my toes.  Please_ don't risk taking this or any other fluoroquinolone if there is ANY other_ safer alternative.  Fluoroquinolones have been shown in several studies to be TOXIC to tendon cells. If you do take it_ STOP and tell your doctor immediately if you notice ANY joint_ tendon_ or muscle pain_ or nervous system effects.  Many people take this without problems_ but be aware that it absolutely can CRIPPLE you with one dose_ as it did me.  I could not walk or stand for more than a couple minutes for several weeks.  Six weeks later I am still extremely limited and in pain.  A well-respected doctor who is knowlegeable of these reactions said my recovery could take 8-10 MONTHS.  Also_ realize that even Rx nasal sprays can be STERIODS_ which will increase your chances of tendon side effects. Neither I nor my family will take this again unless it is do-or-die. Even then_ I am not sure I would choose enduring months or more of disability and pain from taking this drug.,M,35,1  days,11/6/2009,Levaquin
870, 1, suspected pneumonia,nausea_ stomach cramps_ diarrhea_ hand and arm tingling_ muscle fatigue_ confusion_ headache_ shoulder pain_ popping noises in my feet_ unsteady feeling when I walk. NONE of these symptoms were present BEFORE taking this medication.,My doctor doesn't think my symptoms are caused by this drug but I refuse to take any more of it. I react swiftly to drugs and I am very in tune with my body. The types of pains I am experiencing_ I have never felt with any other infection. I was feeling 95% better when I was prescribed this medicine. He wanted me to take it as a just in case measure after having so much trouble with my asthma after probable swine flu two and a half weeks ago. I was still coughing up phlegm_ but the cough was getting better and the amount of discharge from my lungs was becoming less and less. This medicine made me feel very ill... like I was coming down with the flu all over again. I took this medicine just 24 hours ago. I am not taking any more. I still feel nauseous and weak. I will never take Levaquin again. (I was only on the 500 mg dose.),F,33,1  days,11/6/2009,Levaquin
871, 1, pneumonia,It has been nearly 11 months now since I took Levaquin.  A week into it I developed severe knee pain_ as if I had a bad muscle strain.  It developed rapidly into such severe pain that I couldn't walk for days.  Now_ 11 months later_ I still have the severe pain whenever I walk and I can't handle steps or hills.  The orthopedic doc xrayed again today.  Have avascular necrosis of the femoral head_ along with osteoarthritis in the knee.  Happened_ literally_ overnight while on the Levaquin.  Now I will be facing surgery and hope that saves the knee.,,F,62,10  days,11/5/2009,Levaquin
872, 1, Prostatitis,complete physical exhaustion_ body aches_ sore tendons_ numb lips_ pain behind eyeballs_ general loss of focus.,BTW I am a real person that doubted taking this drug after warnings from my parents and reading so much on internet. I opted to try sulfates for my prostatitis after initially being prescribed 500 mg levaquin for 21 days. It did not work so I figured I would give this drug a chance and play Russian Roullete in hopes I would not be affected like all these other people I read about. I was wrong_ I tried to weather the storm as a point of pride but after 16 days I quit. Yesterday on my day off I could barely get out of bed and it felt like my eyeballs were going to pop out of socket. Dealing with this drug is far worse than dealing with the pain I took it for. I am going to choose another doctor. I feel like the Hippocratic Oath in this day and age has become a joke and doctors are becoming no better than ambulance chasing lawyers out for a cheap buck.,M,37,16  days,11/4/2009Email,Levaquin
873, 1, infected toe,I had terrible knee pain which eventually went away. The more significant problems that are still with me are tennis elbow in the left elbow and a torn right shoulder rotator cuff. I felt the elbow pull when lifting a half full bag of trash and the right shoulder tore when I was startled and turned around quickly. Neither of these injuries should have happened. I had never has any problem with these two joints. The orthopedic surgeon wanted to do surgery on the shoulder right away but I stalled for a month and then he said that I might not need surgery. However_ I think it is getting worse now.,LEVAQUIN IS POSION. Do not use it for other than a life threatening situation where there is no alternative. Also_ CVS in June 2009 did not give me the FDA mandated medication guide. This drug was prescribed for me by a podiatrist (not a M.D.) who I went to because my doctor was away. When I called him he did not seem to know about all the recent controversy surrounding this drug. Even though the information is out there_ I fell through the cracks. I didn't notice the new warning section at the top of the regular CVS paper and CVS never gave me the medication guide that is mostly about tendon problems. One CVS pharmacist I talked to at another CVS didn't think there was a FDA mandated medication guide for Levaquin. They appear to be relying on their computer system to spit these things out as needed and hopefully someone will put it in your bag. Knowing what I know now_ if I was a pharmacist I would personally put it in the bag and personally point it out to the patient. I would have noticed the guide and stopped taking the drug at the first sign of pain.,M,59,7  days,11/2/2009Email,Levaquin

877, 1, UTI,Severe incessant itching all over my body_ tingling of hands and feet_ very bad itching on my palms and soles of my feet.  Large hives all over my body.  Edema and tingling of hands and feet.,This drug should be banned! I took the first round of this drug about 1 year ago for a typical UTI.  I had no noticeable side effects.  I recently had another UTI (get them rarely - about 1 a year or every other year)_ so my doctor prescribed the same treatment.  Luckily I only had 2 doses of 500 mg each time.  The reaction I had started approx. 1 week after finishing the 2nd round.  For no apparent reason_ I started itching everyehere on my body - my back_ my front_ my rear_ my legs_ and most noticeably my palms and soles of my feet.  I itched for hours every night!  The itching was very bad at night.  I developed a rash_ very bad hives_ and most recently the latest side affect is edema of my hands and ankles and feet.  The swelling causes my hands to go numb or tingle/burn.  The itching is unbelievable and embarrassing and I already had to miss work. To be sure this was a true allergic reaction I visited a dermotologist because at the time I did not equate these sypmtoms with Levaquin.  He immediately recognized this as such and prescribed a heavy dose of anti-histamine to quell the itch_ and an oral steroid.  I should know better than to just take a drug without reading all about it first.  I normally do my homework but trusted my doctor's judgement.,F,44,2  days,10/23/2009,Levaquin
878, 1, Sinus Infection,Seriously fast pulse_ high blood pressure_ dizzy_ hallucinations_ panic_ strange and frightening drugged feeling. These came on about ten minutes after taking Levaquin. Also had difficulty concentrating and insomnia. I was on 500 MG and only took two doses and threw them out. It took three days to get back to normal. In the three days after taking Levaquin I still felt extremly drugged and drowsy and two days after taking it I experienced an upset in my intestines.,I would suggest that no one take this drug. I felt as if I'd consumed some type of poison. After seeing the side effects and the black box warning from the FDA I'd only take this medicine again if it were a life and death situation.,M,26,2  days,10/23/2009,Levaquin

It hurts just to walk and my legs are weak_ its hard to get in and out of a chair!

882, 1, ,My 91 yr. old mom was prescribed this medicine for UTI and possible other infections.  She had multiple side effects: Vomiting_ insomnia_ monster water blisters on legs (she has venous stasis cellulitis)_ the previous sores on her legs and pressure sores on her fanny had healed up ... but Levaquin really messed her up with the water blisters and muscle weakness.  She is having trouble getting back on her feet because of this muscle weakness.  Only three weeks or so ago she was walking all the time with her walker and getting up and sitting down from a chair_ bed_ etc.  Now it's this very bad muscle weakness and her appetite is very poor.  NO_ IT'S NOT ALL OLD AGE ... SHE WAS DOING FAIRLY WELL UNTIL LEVAQUIN and other antibiotics the doctors were feeding her over a period of a year.,"I call this a DIABOLICAL ... OVERPOPULATION antibiotic that is meant to make people very sick and eventually kill them.  You know doctors today ask if your loved one should have life-saving measures if they have a heart attack_ etc.  When you say_ ""Yes."" and then we will go from there YOU GET THIS OVERPOPULATION LECTURE CRAP or they try to talk you out of life-saving measures.  This is Las Vegas so I don't know if what I am hearing is peculiar to this city or if it's all over the country ... but I am SICK OF THIS LIBERAL GARBAGE.  The doctors out there have a responsibility to make their patients well.  The HMO's should just shut up and let the doctors do their jobs ... LIKEWISE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BUZZ OFF WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE.  The doctors know what to do_ period.",F,91,1  weeks,10/18/2009,Levaquin
883, 1, Pneumonia,combative_ nonresponsive_ hallucinations,my mother stroke vicitim who was diagnosed with dementia was given Levanquin for pneumonia in ER. She started being combative to her home care aides and family members. Did not recognize us_ each time we gave her the medication. Asked her doctor about Levanquin and was told it was safe. We thought we were putting the medications to close together. Took her back to ER because we were sure the medication was the problem. The question was not answered. We missed a couple of days of a 7 day course when she went to the hospital and when we tried to space the drugs. Have decided not to continue the drug. She has only been home for a month since having the stroke and we are all adjusting to the challenges. The last thing we need is more diabilities.,F,85,7  days,10/18/2009,Levaquin
884, 1, MRSA,Extreme muscle and tendon pain as well associated with exhaustion_ memory loss_ loss of appetite_ etc.....,After taking two doses of Levaquin 500mg to treat MRSA in 2006 i experienced the most severe pain all over my body. My family rushed me to the emergency room_ where they proceeded to make me feel like a psycho!  I have been to four different doctors and explained that I feel that what i am experiencing all started from taking the Levaquin and no one will believe me or give me any kind of help or relief!  I am unable to work and can barely do every day type things.  I need help desperately and don't know where to turn!  I am so depressed and miserable_ i had an active well balanced life before this all happened and do not know how to continue feeling this awful!,F,51,2  days,10/17/2009Email,Levaquin
885, 1, sinus infection,The day I took first 750mg pill_ muscle spasms_ muscle weakness_ joint pain in all joints_ racing heart_ extremely nervous/anxious_ massive headache_ insomia only slept 2 hrs that night_ thought I saw spiders when I closed my eyes that night_ that night was shivering and teeth chattering under 3 blankets(was 80 degrees ouside).,Took 1 pill and stopped due to side effects. Next 2 days started to feel better was only having some muscle and joint pain_ day 3 started to feel worse. Next 10 days all joints felt swollen_hurt_ muscles felt weak and was having muscle spasms_ was walking like I was elderly_ had trouble sleeping. Day 10 started taking magnesium and vitamin B6. It helped alot! For me it took away some of the joint pain and relaxed my muscles. Day 12 went back to DR. who prescribed Levaquin. She took an EKG_ urine sample and blood work.  Will find out next week results. She told me I had a bad allergic reaction to Levaquin and for me to never take any floroquinoline again. Now on day 17 and last 4 days have felt normal with no side effects_ although this afternoon my right knee and left ankle started hurting a little bit. I still continue to take magnesium and vitamin B6 and have been eating alot of lean protein_ calcium_ juice and fruit. It has helped during my recovery from Levaquin poisoning. I hope that I am done now with all side effects but know that many people have had ups and downs that have lasted for months off of 1 dose. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG! The side effects are not worth it and last a long_ long time after you have stopped taking it_ even if it is just one dose. If you have a bad experience after taking Levaquin then you should not take any antibiotic in the floroquinoline family. File a MedWatch report with the FDA www.fda.gov hopefully one day it will be pulled from the market.,F,35,1  days,10/17/2009,Levaquin

By the third morning_ I had developed joint stiffness_ muscle pain_ exhaustion_ and a generalized heaviness in my limbs.  Every time I walk_ my feet joints crack_ and I'm starting to get shooting pains on my shins.

893, 1, sinus infection,To start_ I had a left knee replacement in March 09.  I was prescribed levaquin (500mg) in Augut 09.  I had taken a river cruise in Chicago and did a lot of walking.  At first I thought the pain was in my left knee but soon discovered the pain radiated up from my knee to my hip.  I literally had to lift my leg with my hands to get in and out of the car_ and was in extreme pain just walking short distances.  To this day_ if I fall asleep on my left hip_ the pain always wakes me up.  What I read on the internet was that it can cause tendon ruptures.  Maybe it chose the one in my left leg because the leg was already compromised with the knee replacement.  It's 2 months later_ and I'm still not back to normal.  But I hope I will get there.  Some of the ratings do not sound very positive.,I think there should be more education out there for doctors.  I don't believe mine knew of the side affects.  There has to be other alternatives to this drug.  I will say_ though_ it was starting to work great--wish I could have had one more week on it.,F,64,7  days,10/5/2009,Levaquin

897, 1, prostatitis & pelvic floor pain,insomnia_ profuse sweating_ night terrors_ intracranial pressure_ eye floaters_ panic/anxiety attacks_ depression_ ringing-in-ears_ dizziness_ heart palpitations_ seizures & suicidal ideation,"Three 500mg levaquin pills precipitated a massive systems' breakdown that began with an uncharacteristic_ early-evening nightmare and pain in my leg calves directly after having taken the first pill. Soon I experienced insomnia_ cognitive deficit_ paranoia_ and decline in executive & multi-tasking capacity.  These central nervous system (CNS) problems were accompanied by intracranial pressure_ eye floaters_ and narrowing peripheral vision. From time-to-time I became faint (""syncope"") and nearly passed-out while sitting at my desk.  Early-on I lost my language fluency and neither could maintain focus nor find the right words to complete a sentence. Mine was a wholesale body & mind breakdown. I suspect my genetic predisposition --- some defect on my DNA strands --- makes my constitution incompatible with fluourquinolones and led to a life-changing adverse drug reaction. Most galling are medical professionals who appear to be in total denial that an antibiotic pill could wreak such havoc.  You might have thought I was speaking gibberish or Hindi_ so utterly dismissive and disinterested were doctors when I approached them with my concerns that lie outside their comfort level. (Gee_ you'd think that doctors associate thinking outside-the-box with a commensurate increase in their medical malpractice insurance premiums.)

Neck pain and anxiety continued for several days after treatment ended.,I was prescribed 750 mg for 5 days (the new standard high-dosage treatment for sinusitis). Following the instructions on the warning label on the medication_ I phoned my doctor's office on the second day about the tingling arms to see if I should continue treatment_ and she told me to do so but to let her know if it got worse. I regret continuing the drug. While the tingling didn't get worse_ I developed neck pain (probably due to increasing levels of anxiety) and ultimately had an anxiety attack. I became hyper-sensitive to caffeine and experienced bouts of anxiety-related sweating and tingling periodically for two weeks after ending the full course of treatment.  I also had bad neck pain. I've never experienced this kind of extreme anxiety before so I strongly suspect it was caused by the drug. Thankfully_ three weeks later the anxiety has stopped again (I hope for good!).,F,42,5  days,9/29/2009,Levaquin

I was also prescribed a prescription eyedrop from the same family of antibiotics and a 20mg dose_ 2x a day of Prednisone (corticosteriod) to help ""boost"" my immune system. within 3-4 days my knees were extremely stiff and I could hardly bend them. I had minimal stiffness in my neck as well but not enough to attribute it to the battery of medications I was taking. I discontinued the Prednisone and eyedrops on day 5 but continued with the Levaquin through day 9 at which point I quit altogether. It has been a week since discontinuing the treatment and my knees have not improved. I am now taking 1500mg/1200mg respectively of each Glucosomine/Chondroitin 2x a day in an effort to restore their elasticity and flexibility. It's wait and see now. My doctor is uncertain of origin of symptoms and can offer no long term prognosis. Hopefully the worst has passed and no further damage will come of it.",M,37,10  days,9/15/2009,Levaquin

910, 1, Sinus Infection,I took a 10 day dose after two other antibiotics failed to cure the sinus infection.  Started second dose and a couple of days after starting it my left leg got very tight.  I was constantly stretching to stop the pain.  I called the dr's office and they told me to continue taking it as it wasn't the medicine.  I took it 5 more days and then found a sheet that was put in my last prescirption saying you could have tendonitis.  In the meantime_ two tendons under my 3rd and 4th toes on my left foot popped.  Along with the pain was numbness which has continues since that time.  It,It took a month for the tightness to go away but I continue to have numbness in my toes and in the ball of my foot.  I don't know if this is a continuing side effect of the Levaquin or if it's something else.  I now am on another antibiotic for sinus infection (6 months after the Levaquin problem) and so I am wondering if the numbness is being affected by the new antibiotic.  Don't know if it will ever go away.  My doctor said I was the first patient she had with the problem.,F,65,17  days,9/13/2009,Levaquin

Her joint pain is severe enough as to make it difficult for her to climb bus steps to ride bus to and from school.  I was told that this was somewhat experimental_ but that it was considered safe for her body weight.  We were told to stop taking it and advise of any pain in her feet or ankles - she had none_ and unfortunately other joint pain did not surface until the end of the 10 day course.  We were not cautioned to avoid NSAIDS and she took ibuprofen concurrently - bottle says only that antacids or iron products should not be taken within 2 hours of this medicine.  Levaquin was started whilst she was in hospital_ and a 10 day prescription administered once released.,F,12,11  days,9/13/2009,Levaquin

I assumed pain in joints was due to age_ but in late 2008 I started hvg severe pain in shoulder joint. Had xrays and was diagnosed with a torn rotator cuff. Then I started having severe pain in my wrist. The pain was so severe it would wake me up.  My doctor had to give me a time released pain medication so that I could have pain relief all day long and be functional. Now if I sit for a while I have pain in my feet when I stand up. I'm ashamed to walk. IT HAS BEEN TWO YEARS SINCE I TOOK THIS MEDICINE. I don't think the side effects are going to go away for me. Quite frankly I'm wondering if this drug can actualLY cause arthritis. The lawsuit is overlooking some other common side effects like pain in the feet unless it is the achilles tendon. This is not a medicine. It is a legal poison.

960, 1, Sinus Infection,Numbness in right toe,This started shortly after taking 500mg x 5days.  I didn't realize this was most likely caused by Levaquin until I was prescribed it again a year later for another sinus infection_ and did some research.  I finally know what killed the nerve endings in my toe.  Neither doctor or pharamacist warned me of this type of serious side effect.  I stopped the second round after taking only 1 pill and will never take it again_ nor allow anyone in my family to take it.  This drug should be removed from the market!  I feel 'lucky' to have that be the only lasting remnant from the drug after reading everyone else's horror stories.,M,41,5  days,7/22/2009,Levaquin

I'm athletic_ in good shape and exercise hard and intense.  However_ I'm concerned about injuring myself due to the risk of tendonitis or worse_ rupturing a tendon.

I would love to hear about someone my age (41) and if they've experienced any tendon injuries if they've been an athlete their entire life.

979, 4, Severe Sinus Infection,Taking 500 mg 1x daily.  First of all this medication worked great.  Your pharmacist should be telling you about the possible side effects. The pharamcist warned me to not take supplements w/ iron_ no dairy products 2 hrs before and 2 hrs after_ stay out of the sun_ and get some potassium (such as eating a banana a day to avoid leg cramps) and drink plenty of water. This information is also printed on the document you are provided when picking up the medication.. Seriously it is 2009 and people still want to blame everyone but themselves for how they feel.. Take matters into your own hands research the meds before you ingest them and ASK questions_ be a consumer!You take time to research a vechiles_ houses_ appliances before you purchase them...

981, 1, UTI,Horrible hives_ broke out in red itchy rash_ nausea_ vomiting.,This drug should be removed from the market_ or at the very LEAST_ PAs and doctors needs to educate patients about potential side effects. The PA who gave this to me knew I had MS and lots of allergic reactions to drugs_ yet never said a word_ and when I called and said I was getting a horrible red rash_ told me to take Benadryl and keep taking it.

I only took one 750mg dose and was so lethargic and weak the next day_ I couldn't even lift my head off the pillow. Honestly_ I felt like I did in the 80s after having a bad acid trip. My husband was so concerned about me_ he took me to the ER this morning and I was told by the nurse practitioner that she never prescribes this drug because side effects are extremely common. I'm taking Keflex now which is MUCH better_ but after 36 hours of taking Levaquin_ I still felt extremely disoriented and am just now feeling back to normal after 48 hours. To those on this site who are going off on those who have experienced horrible side effects from this drug_ quit it! Different drugs affect different people in different ways.

Was only on for 5 days & after 2nd dose things went down hill. Have never taken a drug like tis in my life. I called the maker after I stopped at the end of 5 days. They aid they would do the FDA report. I guess I was stupid & said OK. I should have done it myself. Who knows if they ever did. How long is it going to take FDA to get this off the market. My initial thoughts were that it was a drug interaction with 2 other drugs I take. Two pharmacys checked their systems & did not see any problem.

The Levaquin did the trick in about 4 days.  I finished the prescribed course 500mg for 10 days.  I question some of the reviews about people feeling so sick or achy from the medication.

998, 1, upper respiratory infection/sinus,I had severe insomnia; I felt anxiety and panic. I could not sit still. I was feeling so bad with my sinuses and my chest and all I wanted to do was rest. I could never rest. My shoulders also began to hurt not sure if from the drug or the intense anxiety.  I quit this drug after 4 days,I would never recommend this drug. It is so expensive and I paid $ 60.00 for it even with insurance_ however_ I had to quit taking it due to the severe panic and anxiety. I felt that this was worse for my condition than the quitting the antibiotic and not taking it. No one mentioned anything about side effects (not my doctor or the pharmacy). I plan on informing both of them the effects I felt on this drug. I found that once I quit the drug_ I was able to manage my infection with Eucalyptus steam treatments_ ginger_ lemon_ and honey tea and the ability to REST!!! I also used Mucinex which is wonderful.

1002, 1, Recurring sinus infection,First dose - didn't sleep all night.  Started getting intense pain deep in both my calves the next day. Second dose - insomnia and calve pain persisted.  Also started to have this overwhelming feeling of despair. Third dose - pain in calves and insomnia persisted.  Feelings of despair intensified. Called my doctor and was told to stop the medication.  So I stopped but the insomnia_ pain_ and despair continued.  My prescribing physician had me see a rheumatologist but_ since I had never had a need to see one_ the first appt I got was 3 weeks away. After 5 days of no sleep_  I went and got acupuncture.  It helped immensely with the insomnia and despair. Continued acupuncture sessions but they were not relieving the leg pain.  Pain also spread from my calves to my knees_ hamstrings_ hips_ and upper arms. Also have bouts of numbness in my fingers. My skin was also very sensitive - felt like a cold burn to be touched or when showering.  Went to a naturopathic doctor and got herbs and vitami,Traditional doctors are useless.  The rheumatologist I saw casually said that my tendons were inflammed and that the pain would go away within the next 8 weeks.  When it didn't_ he diagnosed me with osteoarthritis in my knees and told me to lose weight so I did - 25 pounds in 1 month.  Pain didn't go away so he finally did xrays.  Turns out that I don't have arthritis.  He maintained that the fact that I didn't have any of these issues until I took Levaquin is purely coincidental. Oh yeah_ I did get blood tests to detect any signs of rheumatoid/immune systems issues (all these were negative) but it wasn't until 4 weeks after I had taken the medication.   I went to an orthopedic knee specialist.  He lectured me that the problem with the medical industry is all the frivolous lawsuits like the levaquin lawsuit and the fact that my pain coincided with taking levaquin was purely coincidental.  Afterall_ he prescribes levaquin all the time and has never had a complaint.  (Funny how we patients are not allowed to use anecdotal information but the doctors can pull it out of their pockets whenever it suits them.) Oh yeah_ he's the one who diagnosed my torn cartlidge in both knees but it's not from levaquin.  According to him_ I have probably had torn cartlidge for a while and_ again_ it's just coincidental that I didn't have any pain until I took levaquin.  He then had the audacity to advise me to just focus on fixing my knees and not worry over how it happened. Yeah_ right.,F,49,3  days,6/11/2009Email,Levaquin

1007, 3, Cellulitis - Bacterial infection,Heartburn_ random joint pains in wrist and hands_ feeling run down_ mild headache,32 year old male here. I was prescribed Levaquin 500mg 2 days ago for 10 days after being diagnosed with cellulitis which is a bacterial infection in the blood. I had a swollen and sore groin on the right side. I already take prilosec once a day for acid reflux. Since starting Levaquin the infection seems to be clearing up_ but the heartburn is pretty vicious. Yesterday I thought to myself hmm_ maybe I didn't take my prilosec but I thought I did. So_ I took a second prilosec with no results. Today again as listed on the bottle I waited two hours after taking the Levaquin and then took my prilosec_ but no luck. I've since taken a second prilosec and a couple of tums. As I drove home from work the heartburn started reoccurring. Thats when I googled it and came to find this site and that I'm not crazy. I also had sharp pains in my wrist and hands today and feel really run down and almost mildly depressed. I can live with joint pains and feeling a little run down_ but the heartburn really does effect your eating and sleeping. I guess I'll have to see how the next 7 days go.,M,32,3  days,6/4/2009,Levaquin

I've had a bad sinus infection and this is the 6th antibiotic I've tried to get rid of it.  Yes_ I'm heading in to the ENT soon.  Anyway_ I just took my fifth pill of Levaquin and ended up calling the doctor.  Today and yesterday I've had strange pains shooting about my body.  My left shoulder was throbbing for about a half hour and I feel like I have shin splints.  Last night my left calf started to ache.  Today my wrists and thumbs are hurting.  I'm a young_ healthy person.  I'm not allergic to anything and I take my vitamins daily.  My doctor told me to quit taking Levaquin and they put me on Bactrim as a follow-up.  I wouldn't advise this drug to anyone.  I'm just hoping I also don't end up with a tear or other worse problems down the road because of this.,I do need to say that it seems to be helping with my sinus infection_ but it's hard to tell because every night when I take my pill_ I get a horrible headache and have problems sleeping.Read all the stories.

1056, 1, Recurring Sinus Infection,On Day 3 of treatment -- Severe joint_ hands_ arms_ and shoulder pain. Swelling in fingers and hands.  Tight and painful tendons in back of legs and hands to elbows. I experienced dizziness to the point of being unable to drive. I am still experiencing this after 3 months of being off Levaquin.,I was prescribed this medicine 750 mg 1x a day for 21 days for a recurring sinus infection back in January 2009. Day 3 I began to have severe joint and muscle pain in legs_ arms and shoulders. Also_ very tight tendons in back of legs_ forearms and hands. Day 5 I was so dizzy I could not drive. I was unaware of the potential side effect of this drug as my doctor did not warn me. I mistakenly attributed the pain to the home improvement projects I was in the middle of_ which can be strenuous_ and moving into my new home. I am far from out of shape_ so it surprised me that I would feel this sore and have so much pain. On Day 10 I could not get out of bed without help_ I could barely walk_ it was excruiating. I had pain and swelling in my hands and fingers_ there wasn't a place in my body that didn't hurt like hell. I had no strength overall. My daughter had to help me to the toilet and put my socks on. I couldn't figure out what was happening to me. The only thing that had changed was my taking the Levaquin. I went online and found these reviews and a multitude of other website with warnings of side effects. WHY_ didn't my doctor warn me??? If I had been aware_ I would have recognized the side effects and STOPPED taking the meds immediately!! Its been over 3 months since I stopped taking it and I'm still experiencing severe pain_ swelling_ loss of strength_ extremely tight tendons and fatigue.

I really applaud her for being so committed to a cause to spend that kind of money for this project. The director had an adverse reaction to Levaquin and wanted to try and bring greater awareness to quinolone toxicity. The film was very well done. The movie was excellent! Very informative and interesting. In addition to quinolone information_ the film delves into a lot about the corrupt FDA. For anyone that has been damaged by a quinolone this is a very good film to show your disbelieving doctor. It may also be a good film to have on file for disability purposes. I hope this film can bring about some change an,,M,44, ,4/10/2009Email,Levaquin

Well they haven't run any test to see any improvement_ and I did experience some side effects like dark urine_ green stools_ which they said its normal but its not normal to me.  I was feeling dizzy and had pain at the site of injection.  I complaint about it and they ignored me.  Back at home_ I had burning sensation in my arms and upper back_ weight lost.

This ended up being an injury that lasted quite a while.,Before I started levaquin_ I was an active martial arts practitioner. However It gradually attacked various connective tissues. I was warned about tendon issues_ so I stopped strenuous and risky physical activity. I was walking about 3 miles a day for about a week_ then I had to stop that. by the 2nd week I could not walk more than a hundred yards or so a day. Finally I experienced sudden pain in my hamstring while doing dishes_ which turned into an injury much like a severe muscle pull or minor tear. I have no idea when I will be able to do martial arts again. Funny thing is_ that I was given this after multiple urine tests taken weeks apart showed no sign of infection. Was this really necessary? So  its hard to say if it even did anything. The prescription was for 1 month.,M,42,14  days,4/7/2009,Levaquin

1082, 1, Travel Egypt for stomach bacteria,Severe knee pain lasting from August 2008_ still somewhat painful.,I had once before on a trip_ and for cataract surgery both eyes_ and possibly for gall bladder surgery. After 2nd day of taking_ my knees began to ache_ and they hurt the rest of the trip_ which was very strenuous.  After arriving back home_ the knees were in pain_ hurting even more during the night when sleeping on my side.  Previously_ I had been working out at a gym three times a week doing a vigorous workout called Body Pump.After not getting better_ I just kept up my normal pace of life_ except for the workouts.  When the pain became unbearable in my right knee in November_ I saw an orthopedist.  I had a cortisone shot in the knee to see if that would have any effect.  After one more shot_ I tried therapy and Advil. My knee would not straighten out by 10 degrees_ and I probably needed surgery.  I have my own EMS (TENS) machine at home_ doing physical therapy every day.  My knee now will go straight_ there is still pain at night_ but not nearly as much as before.  I only became aware of the Levaquin connection by accident_ my son-in-law said that he didnt take it on our trip because it blows out your joints.   The scary part of it is that orthopedists use Levaquin as an antibiotic for their surgeries.  If I hadnt made the connection_ I would have had another dose of Levaquin for the surgery_ and I shudder to think of those consequences.

After realizing that my health was was in ruins_ i decided to start taking my supplements again around the time of my course of levequin. started taking my multi's again and more importantly my MSM ( similar to chondrontin or glucosimine)  I recently read that MSM has been proven to help the body fight infection_ as it is required to be present for the body to fight infection.

1106, 3, pneumonia,I took the 750mg for 10 days and pneumonia got better.  However_ on the 9th day I developed severe pain in back and side of knee_ I thought maybe I had strained it since I had been down for 2 weeks sick. Couldn't stand to walk so Dr. checked it after another week.  U/S neg. for clots and xray neg for fx. or dislocation but showed effusion.  Dr. says I had tendon tear_and probable OA_ but I don't know how I got it! He swears I had to have twisted my knee or fallen_ which I did not! And it happened fast_ starting on a Friday afternoon_ and by Saturday morning I could not stand up. It's now been nearly 2 months since it started and I still have severe pain in knee and swelling.  Can walk better once I am up on it_ but it feels funny and my calf feels like it's in spasm from trying to walk on that leg. My blood pressure also shot back up during the time I started Levaquin and so I am now back on Maxzide for that.,I asked Dr. whether it was related to the Levaquin and he denied any possibility.  But to still be hurting this long after and no injury to cause it makes me wonder_ especially since it has side effect of poss. tendinitis and tendon rupture_which he denies happening with any frequency.  He put me on Prednisone_ decreasing_ for a week when I first went to him_ but it didn't do much.  Had to stop taking so much Motrin due to a 20lb. weight gain in 2 weeks' time_ which has now gone back down_ as well.,F,62,10  days,2/28/2009Email,Levaquin

I started researching and found out what this drug does.  Even if you have taken it before with seemingly no know side effects_ it will still damage your body.  Levaquin is absorbed by every part of your body and does kill the bacteria_ but also kills nerve_ muscle_ and other good cells.  I looked back and found that I took 750mg for 5 days back in 2/2006 for bronchitis and thought I had no side effects.

When I called my doctor_ they simply told me to stop taking the medication.  I did_ and I ended up having to have sinus surgery.  Currently I am on Levaquin again after being diagnosed with a bacterial sinus infection.  The side effects I mentioned above are the only ones I am feeling and they are not too bad this time around.  My infection is almost gone and it's only day 5.  I hope it knocks the infection out so I don't have to go through surgery again.  I don't think this medication is for everyone_ but I think if you start to experience really severe side effects_ then you should stop taking it immediately and call your doctor.  Don't keep wondering whats wrong and ignore the symptoms_ obviously that's not a wise thing to do.  Otherwise_ I believe that for some people this medication does the trick when needed.

Now I'm staying home from the gym but regular activity gives me serious muscle soreness that feels like I pushed way too hard at the gym -- it's as if I doubled my weights and worked out through the pain -- or did a hard workout after a year of inactivity. In other words -- VERY sore....but all I am doing is regular daily activities. It kills me to stand from a sitting position_ especially if I am on the floor. I have to think twice before crouching down for anything now - I have to analyze whether or not it's worth the pain I'll feel when I try to get back up. I'm too young for this.

I took the Levaquin at 6:30 PM then around 2PM the next day I noticed slight whelts on my butt and legs.

(All this within a couple of hours_ lasted 24 hours.),Took the one pill_ and one pill only.  I've had many health issues - including cancer - and never had an issue with a medicine like I did with Levaquin.  Now that I'm feeling better have been doing research and discovered that others with only a few dosages are suffering terribly_ especially with joint and vision problems.

1260, 1, pneumonia,500 mg for 5 days.  On day 2_ I experienced extreme hip pain and attributed it to lying around for so long.  Day 4_ I could barely get out of bed because of hip_ ankle_ knee pain. Now_ over 5 months later_ I still have pain in my knees and ankles_ but the worst pain is in my shoulders.  My Dr. said it couldn't still be from the levaquin because it would not still be in my system.  I have never had joint pain prior to taking levaquin and was very active_ jogging 3 miles a day. Right now_ it hurts to hold my hands up to the computer!  I am taking Celebrex for the tendonitis that my Dr. says I have_ Lortab for the pain and Motrin every 2-3 hours.

I decided to put a 5 as a rating because it seems there are a lot of positive comments that sound like drug sales rep masquerading as consumers and saying that this drug is a god send. I fear that people might just read the very enthusiastic comments and decide to take it. And yes_ the very enthusiastic comments are fictitious...think about it_ if you were a regular patient whose infection went away and was back to normal_ would you be trying to post a comment online...these are drug reps!!!!

I had specifically asked my doctor whether I had to worry about such activities while taking the drug_ but he said ""no.""

Whenever I tried to lie down or get some sleep I got snorkel-boarded in my own vomit. But then also: amazingly spikey headaches; like a roofer set a roofing nail right at the top of your skull and then whacked it home with single blow; these do not go away with just an aspirin or two. And_ muscle weakness_ and then dementia in various forms (vivid_ disturbing dreams and thought patterns_ morbid thoughts_ etc.) Then followed by exhaustion and insomnia. For those who know the term_ it felt like a really bad attack of autonomic dysreflexia. For those who don't_ well it's like the worst case of fever and flu you've ever had. In fact_ chills and shakiness are something I should have mentioned earlier.,"Consider that complaints at this website on Levaquin are greater by two orders of magnitude than for any other fluoroquinolone. Thank you; I no longer feel I'm going insane. The patient is always right. (Ask your urologist to take a course of this drug before he ever prescribes it again.) It felt like I was being poisoned. (I took three courses_ with about a week's break in between to see if the UTI had been fixed.) It seems that my sensitivity to this poison has increased with each course. I will NEVER take this drug again. At first_ I attributed the symptoms to my kidney infection_ assuming that they had WAY failed_ and that I was dying from the build-up of toxins in my body. Eventually_ I was able to figure out that it was the Levaquin. I am amazed at the ""self-similarity"" of its few defenders on this website. They are rude and crude_ and frankly idiotic.

The experience was far worst than anything similar I've encountered from wearing nicotine patches to bed or from taking codeine-based Tylenol.  At work today (Wednesday) I suffered a VERY sudden increase in my pulse rate_ heart palpitations_ along with a strong wave of dizziness and lightheaded feeling that almost led to my passing out at my desk.  I got up and walked over to where there were other people so that if I did pass out someone would know about it.  I recovered after about ten minutes_ went back to my desk and searched on the Web about Levaquin side effects_ which is how I found this site.

Everyone is going to have a different reaction to any medication - some people have none at all_ and some people have the worst of the worst.

So I looked up some other medications on AskPatient.com that I have taken before with no significant side effects to see what the postings for those drugs are. I even looked up over-the-counter Tylenol and sure enough_ a significant number of the postings for each medication are negative with dire warnings not to take that particular medicine.  I have no doubt that many of the people who had awful things to say about the drugs truly suffered from the symptom they stated_ but I am not convinced it was from that particular drug in each and every case.

Now_ 2 days post-script_ my knees are hurting to the point of interfering with my life style. After reading some of the other comments posted_ I'm concerned that this will take a while to resolve itself.

Was very emotional and worried about potential surgery even to the point of tears. (and im a pretty together person).  After leaving hospital and continued course of 500mg lev for 10 days...had real sensitivity to light_ heavy head_foggy brain_ numbness in hands and arms at night--limbs were just dead.  some 5 months later had great insomnia in addition to the above.  felt like i was in slow motion--developed extreme insomnia and sensitivity to cold.  temperature of body varied greatly.  since then have had great anxiety_ even some depression_depersonalization to friends/people.  choking while drinking--difficulty with light in stores like home depot and mall. suicidal thoughts a lot trying to figure out why i was feeling this way.,sleep has gotten better some 8 months after taking drug.  still have problems with brain fog_ some motor skills and logic_ numbness_ anxiety_ and sensitivity to light.  Had been in perfect health prior to this and am currently unable to work as a pilot due to the motor skill and vision issues.  this is a hell unlike anything i could have ever imagined.  No warnings about side effects while on IV were ever given to me or mentioned.  i had no idea an antibiotic could affect your central nervous system as this drug apparently does.  all doctors state that essentially its not the drug...etc....at best they say there are no long term studies to verify it so they dont acknowledge it.  Just blowing us off--they dont want to know or the mfg doesnt want them to hear about it.  all dr.s attribute these informatin sites as litigation related vs actual experiences with validity. the infection did go away but i wish i had never taken this drug.,M,50,14  days,9/22/2007,Levaquin

I stopped taking the drug without consulting my physician four days ago and am still experiencing these side effects.,I have seen my physician at least once a week for the past four weeks. The only mention of side effects had to do with stomach issues of which I had none.

Died. I would recommend any anti bio that is not in this class of Anti Bio's. Good ole Penicillin or Amoxicillin. The Z pack has always been ok for me. Of course_ nothing is perfect.

The peach colored ones). My body is pretty sensitive to meds but for the most part I was okay. I did develop a yeast infection_ had some really trippy and disturbing dreams_ and my creatinine levels are elevated (kidney function) which doc is assuming is from all the antibiotics/infection. It was determined my pneumonia is on the mend but it still took me over a week off the Levaquin to feel semi normal but I still get tired which may be the Levaquin and maybe just the course of recovery.

I had already taken a complete Z-pak which barely touched the sinusitis.  The Levaquin had me back on my feet again in a couple of days.  The side effects were extremely mild compared to the benefits.  Oh_ also I have SVT and a transient Mitral Valve Prolapse.

This is my second go round with this drug_ I have a rating on here somewhere where i took it for diverticulitis but enlarged prostate kept giving me a UTI that eventually went to my kidneys. I took 1000 mg / day for 5 days and then 500 for another 10 and it knocked it out,If you are real sick it does get the job done. I was glad to get it this time and since I was taking it w/o the flagyl it was tolerated much better so I re-rated it.

Heart racing_ anxious_ horrendous VIVID nightmares & hallucinations_ paranoid behavior. My muscles & tendons felt like someone was taking a knife repeatively ripping them apart. When I saw my dr. w/in 3 days with my symptoms_ he literally ~snickered~ in my face. After three rounds of cipro & levaquin all high in mg_ what was a  confident & strong willed ~woman~_ I've become a shell of sometimes unbearable pain and unable to cope mentally. I finally REFUSED to take this drug_ I'd rather live with sinus infections (was told I was allergic to penacillin (sp?). All one has to do is check out www.levaquin.com and follow the links to side affects. 6 doctors didNOT believe me until I was sent to a pain management_ Dr. William Odom in Columbia/Lexington S.C.

1459, 1, UTI,insomnia_ joint pain in knees_ arms_ shoulders & fingers_ headache and tender teeth (odd!),Was given this med (in sample packages) when I had a very bad reaction to a sulfur based antibiotic.  The doc told me very little about possible side effects (loss of appetite_ thirsty_ diarrhea) so no concerns when I left.  Took first pill yesterday morning and after just a few hours noticed the joint pain and headache.  Attributed it to still getting over the bad reaction from the day before but after a very restless night and still having joing pain this morning_ looked up some info. on the net.  After reading everything_ I'd rather be safe than sorry_ as I value my mobility and being able to stay active_ so I wont be taking any more pills. I work out regularly_ am a healthy 34 year old and consider myself pretty tolerant of side effects (have been on Accutane 3 times) and pain_ but I'd rather try something else than jeopardize my health long term.

1462, 3, sinus (Serratia marcescens),Cramping of foot_ tingling in face_ soreness in wrist_ mental confusion,I've taken Levaquin two other times in the past year with no adverse affects. So this was unexpected. It came on gradually after 3 days. It was not a sudden reaction. I would not go so far as to not recommend this drug. Rather I would say be very cautious_ even if you have used it before. And be alert to the warning signs. When I say cramping in the foot_ it wasn't a constant cramp_ rather an occasional cramp_ but the rate increased. Likewise the wrist soreness was subtle_ and then became much more noticeable at the end of day 4 and throughout day 5. Likewise the tingling in the face was just a limited number of instances_ which you would normally tend to not pay attention to_ but became more noticeable at the end. Since all the changes were relatively slow occuring (it wasn't like it was anaphylactic shock or breaking out in hives)_ it just took a little while to piece things together as to what was happening. That's why I say be alert.,M,60,5  days,5/15/2007,Levaquin

1465, 5, Sinusitis,I took Levaquin for 6 weeks for chronic sinusitis.  Cured the sinuses while I was on it but the infection came back shortly after I stopped the drug_ and ended up having to have surgery.  I did not have any side effects with Levaquin and have taken it multiple times for varying treatment courses.,I am a M.D. who has prescribed Levaquin for sinusitis and URIs.  Thus far_ I have had only one patient who has had a negative reaction (tendonitis).  I will continue to prescribe this medication when indicated_ but with instructions to discontinue immediately if side effects develop.  Unfortunately_ all drugs have side effects and we clearly are better off with them than without.  Our life expectancy is so much higher since the development of antibiotics.  But_ as with any medicine or herbal product_ there is always a risk of an adverse reaction.  There are many people who are allergic to peanuts and some have died eating them_ but that doesn't mean we should pull peanut butter off the shelves.,F,40,56  days,5/12/2007Email,Levaquin
1466, 1, Sinus infection,Cured the sinus infection but resulted in severe tendinopothy in my thighs (just above the knees) and upper arms. Severe pain_ no sleep_ assorted reactions.  I would NEVER recommend this drug.,After taking this for 9 days I had severe swelling in my thigh tendons that made it difficult to walk or flex. I could not see my knee caps. I have kept legs wrapped_ elevated and iced. After two weeks the swelling in my thighs has subsided 40-50% and is less painful. BUT the same reaction has now started in my upper arms.  I have limited range of motion_ sleepless and painful nights. This has severely restricted my ability to work and live the active life I am accustomed to living. It has also made me incredibly grouchy.  From research on this site I consider myself lucky as others have had even worse reactions.  I am trying to think positive and believe that in time this will subside and I will return to the same level of wellness I was before taking this drug.,M,61,9  days,5/12/2007Email,Levaquin

1468, 1, bronchitis,Severe swelling in both knees with great pain.  I am having strange dreams_ but since I take Ambien it may have lessened the effect of the levaquin.  I also have chronic anxiety so take Xanax daily_ which may have also controlled some of the side effects of the drug.  I've been off the drug for over two weeks and the swelling has decreased in my knees.  I've also kept my legs elevated a lot.  As soon as I go out and do any considerable walking the knee pain gets greatly worse.  This drug worked extremely well for the bronchitis_ but I intend to call my doctor after reading all these comments and tell him that this drug should NEVER be given to folks with arthritis or anxiety problems.  In fact_ it should only be given as a LAST RESORT.,"If you take a new antibiotic_ get as much information on the drug before you blindly take it and end up in trouble.

I kept debating whether or not I should have my husband take me to the ER.  I felt so strange that it was actually hard to describe.  I called my doctor the next morning_ described my symptoms as best as possible_ and was told to immediately discontinue the medication.  A new prescription was then called in for me.,I would be very cautious about taking this medication.  Do NOT take it if you are going to be home alone - at least until you know how your body will react to it.

You must also make sure that you are replacing the good bacteria in your body because this medication kills all bacteria in your body.

The authors say it should not be prescribed to pregnant women and seniors.  Doctors should explain the side effects or better yet the FDA should take it off the market.

Eating more vegetables_ fruits because I think it's the acidity left in the body by the levaquin that is causing the problem.  Doctors should know this and know what they are prescribing.

My legs were tingling and I thought I had a brain tumor. After going to the ER I had a cat scan showing I had sinusitis. The doctor told me to continue the medication so I did. I continued to have sleepless nights_ neck pain_ and muscle spasms. I called the ER and told me that I was crazy and it wasnt the medication. After my 5th day I found this web site and was so happy but terrified at the same time. I stopped the medicine and had my first good night sleep last night.

My fiance has been given anti-anxiety meds now_ and he hates taking them. He is miserable_ and the panica attacks still happen. This behaviour is completely and tatally out of character_ and was most definately cause by the levaquin. And for the people who have posted rude comments about these reactions not being because of the drug_ or being in the literature for the Rx_ you are either morons or working for the cash cow company who keeps this toxin on the market.

The side effects were_ Needing less sleep_ Being more active_ Feeling unusually happy_ irritable_ or energetic_ Making unrealistic plans or focusing intensely on a goal_ Being easily distracted and having racing thoughts_ Having unrealistic feelings of self-importance Becoming more talkative_ and the many other symptoms that go along with a MANIC EPISODE. This is not including the severe headaches_ leg pain_ and HYSTERIA.  ,"DOCTORS and PHARMACISTS need to be alerted and better educated about this drug. They were getting ready to diagnose my wife with Bipolar Disorder and would have had every reason to do so. Well I did not want my wife tagged with a label to follow her the rest of her life.

This tiny breach into reality was what I discerned as a break in her transformation form a 40+ year old woman who was acting like a teenager.        This is the worst reaction to a drug I have ever seen. The lady I had known and been married to for 11 years was gone. ""IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH"" became a reality for me.

He did read them but since he had not had any problems/symptoms for the few days he had been taking it he kept taking the Levaquin for the complete 10days dosage of 750mg once per day for his pneumonia and he never experienced any problems and it was very effective in clearing up his pneumonia.

I had no reaction at all with Levaquin.I was prescribed Levaquin for a uti/bladder infection that did not go away after a 10 day dose of Cipro 1000mg per day. It  turns out the reason it did not go away with the Cipro was because I actually have a kidney stone and until I pass that the uti will not completely go away (the Cipro did knock the infection down considerably! hence the low dose of Levaquin).

Also not a good idea.  Didn't sleep a wink.  Moved dosage to 7am_ and woke up three or four times last night_ but that's way better than no sleep at all.  Yesterday discovered that diarhea is yet another side effect from this drug.  Thank goodness it's the weekend.  Lastly_ I have a very strong metallic taste in my mouth that no amount of brushing or Listerine seems to help.  I certainly can't say Levaquin doesn't work_ but I can definitely say that I won't be taking it again.

Then the body aches began along with pain in top of my head. Every joint hurts and my spine as well. One knee is very bad_ ankle swollen. When I walk at times it feels like I have to push myself to keep going_ weakness may be setting in. I also have MS though_ so it's a real catch-22 for me. I haven't called the doctor yet as I didn't think they were drug related. Although I have arthritis_ osteoarthritis_ etc._ I wondered if the drug could be the problem.,After reading this board_ I am checking with my doctor and may discontinue (I finished day 7) if I don't get him. I hate the side effects but feeling better so much faster is a BIG help for me. I'm not sure what is the worse of two evils? Bronchitis going into pneumonia or Levaquin's side effects???,F,58,7  days,1/12/2007,Levaquin

1558, 1, sinus infection,UPDATE. Someone asked to know how long it took to get over it. I saw a doctor yesterday after having taken my last dose the day before. She is not the one who gave me the Levaquin_ and said she never prescribes it. She told me to take Benadryl to help me sleep_ Advil for pain (and gave me Lortabs for extreme pain in case I needed it_ which I haven't yet). I also took one 250 mg tablet of magnesium after reading about someone else here who thought magnesium helped. She also told me to cut out caffeine and drink a lot of water to help flush it out of my system. I slept well last night with the Benadryl and my knee is also somewhat better this morning. She did say it can sometimes take weeks to get it completely out of your system. I hope this helps someone else.,I had taken 750 mg for 5 days.

It isn't bad enough to keep me from walking but I have stopped working out_ I am going to take a couple of weeks off of working out.,I had never had this medication before so I decided to look it up on the internet.  I found what I thought was a lot of bad press so I called my doctor and he said it is perfectly safe. I also spoke to a friend at work whose wife is a pharmacist and she said it is one of the most widely prescribed drugs for infection.  So I continued to take it.

1588, 1, Yes,I am 50 years old and have been running 5 miles daily for a 12 year period. I developed a cough in the summer that lasted longer than normal_ about three weeks. We were at our summer home in Sanibel Island and I thought redtide was causing the problem. I returned to NC and the problem continued another week so I decided to go to the doctor. He prescribed Levaquin for the cough. After taking the drug for five days of a 10 day dose of 500MG of Levaquin per day_ I continued to run daily and noticed pain in my Achilles Tendon for no apparent reason. This continued for about three days and finally I decided to read the side effects of the drug. In small print I noticed it said to discontinue use of this drug if you have Tendon Pain. I then went online and found several Blogs about others having similar side effects. I then decided to stop taking the Levaquin and to describe my side effects.

By 8th day_ localized to severe right achilles tendon pain - I stopped the drug at that time.  The scary part is that I am off the meds for 3 days now and I have developed moderate to severe neuropathic pain in my right leg (pins/needles/numbness).,I knew about the possibiliy of tendon problems but I had no IDEA that this could be progressive AFTER the drug stops and that these other problems may be PERMANENT.

When i asked the Pharmasist (spelling ?) what side effect just told me not to take any iron pills with it. Nothing about not being able to sleep the horrible stomach pains_ the shits. I would take the pill in morning by afternoon I would be running for the bathroom and i would continue to run for bathroom for atleast 12-15 hours.

Joints were sore before I ever took this stuff.  My ears have been ringing for 15 years. I did have a couple weird dreams last night.  One was really crazy.  Like a death thriller movie.

My confusion symptom frequency/severity peaked about 2 months after completing the drug_ then the constant mild headache and ringing in my ears began too. It has been 4 months_ and I still have a strange headache most days_ have confusion and memory problems after I go outside without dark sunglasses_ even on a cloudy day.  One doctor speculated it was a photosensitive seizure (which I now see is one of Levaquin's adverse effects.),The doctors sent me to over $10_0000 worth of tests for Multiple Sclerosis/Lupus but all tests were negative.  Unfortunately_ since the adverse reaction to quinolones can appear weeks after completing the course of the drug (someone wrote that it creates lesions in your brain like MS does) its difficult to associate Levaquin with the damage it inflicts.  I have asked my pharmacy to document that I had an adverse reaction to quinolones_ so that I can never accidentally take this class of drug again.   This drug was poison.,F,47,8  days,10/30/2006,Levaquin

The diarrhea came on the sixth dose too-boy did it come! Now i have pain in my shoulders. Damn what's next? My sinus infection does seem to be better now. But now i have to wonder_ "" Do i want a runny nose or a runny ass""? The doctor's should inform patients well prior to prescribing this medication so that people don't get scared out of their mind.

1609, 1, Yeast Infection,Second night taking medication_ developed a rash around nose area. Third day felt very tired_ exhausted and doing alot of dreaming and developed flu-like symptoms as though I was about to develope a cold.  I had started to get a slight run from my nose.  I was also experiencing severely right leg cramps.  Once again extremely exhausted_ loss of appetite_ cold feet_ fever like feelings_ chills.  Fourth night taking medication woke up with a severe headache_ swollen nose_ nasal passage completely clogged and unable to breath through nose_ constantly dreaming.,Complete insomonia.  Not completely sure where all of the cold and nasal symptoms were coming from since I didn't have a cold to begin with.  Fifth day nasal passage completely stopped up.  I stopped taking medication after fifth night.  The symptoms of the cold and nasal congestion continued for a few more days after discontinuing the medication.  Since then I have the facial twitching_ body itching without a rash_ right leg cramping and unable to fall asleep without taking other meds.  From reading all the posts I am still unsure why my doctor would prescribe me Levaquin for a yeast infection when it causes a yeast infection afterwards.  I was also prescribe a yeast cream to go along with the prescription.  But my main reason for taking it was to stop the yeast infection.  Could someone tell me why I developed sever Sinus congestion and a sore throat while taking this medicine_ because that bothers me.  I was prescribe levaquin for 7 days and took only for 5.

1610, 5, Sinus infections_ giardia_ ulcers_,I am allergic to just about every antibiotic EXCEPT Levaquin. My Dr.(Internist) has prescribed it for everything from chronic sinus infections to giardia/cryptosporidiosis to diverticulosis to ulcers. I'm a flight attendant and it took a long time to figure out what was making me sick. Don't ever drink COFFEE_ TEA (water comes from tanks & doesn't boil) or WATER on an airplane and don't wash your hands in the lavatory. (The tanks never get cleaned and they have parasites - treatment used on the water doesn't kill parasites) Use Purell or Germ X instead.The tanks are full of parasites on every plane - every airline. Many flight attendants don't even know this. I was in/out of the hospital for 3 weeks before a Gastroenterologist diagnosed me and I hadn't been out of the country.

I have suffered ear and sinus infections since I was a child (now 36) and this stuff lets me recover faster and more completely than any other antibiotic I have been prescribed.

I believe because of tachycardia my heart ""threw off"" a blood clot which lodged in the eye.  95 percent of the cause of an occular arterial occlusion is plaque in the carotid arteries (I had none) or heart murmer_ tachycardia or irregular heartbeat causing the heart to ""throw off"" a blood clot.

The past week my arms have been going numb while i sleep. I think this drug has affected my Central Nervous System and my joints. The Drug manufacturer does have a warning on their insert about having CNS problems if taking NSAIDS (CELEBREX_ NAPROXEN_ ETC_ in combination with Levaquin). Anybody thinking about taking this drug_ please do your homework!!! This pain I'm experiencing is going to be very difficult to overcome! I would NEVER have used this drug if i knew what kind of side effects it caused. The prescribing information insert also talks about examination of weight bearing joints revealed persistent lesions of the cartilage. Other fluoroquinolones also produce similiar erosions in weight bearing joints. This explains the joint pain. Once again_ the drug manufacturer actually has this info on their insert. I think the FDA should ban this drug.,Horrible Drug that should only be used in Life or Death situations.  I think that this drug company should be held accountable just like the makers of Vioxx were held accountable in the court of law.

1643, 1, urinary tract infection,experienced severe pain in hands and feet to the point of not being able to walk. Hands suffered most when driving any distance. When the doctor finally told me it could be the levaquin causing the pain and I quit taking it my symptoms were dramatically better within 2 to 3 of not taking. To date it has been approximately 6 months and my feet and hands still hurt periodically especially in the morning. I would have quit taking the med much sooner had I known that this was a side effect and still pray that the pain will go away as I'm only 39!,If the makers of this drug or anyone else knows how to repair the side effects that I suffered I would be greatly appreciative of an answer.

1649, 1, Flu developing into bronchitis,Extreme pain in both knees and right knee popping out of joint,Taken for 5 days in May of 2006.  Problems started on day 6 - extreme pain in both knees_ popping sounds when walking_ right knee actually slipping out of place. Left knee healed within a few weeks - right knee did not. Went to 2 doctors - both said I must have injured the knees.  MRI revealed a damaged meniscus in the right knee and x-rays showed slight arthritis in both knees.   Anti-inflammatory prescribed.  The knee felt like it was getting better but this week it started popping out of the joint again and I am experiencing some joint pain in other areas (dont know if related or just aging process). The doctor insists that the knee problem cannot be attributed to Levaquin - his reasoning is that all the joints would be involved not just the knee.  Although I am 61 years old_ I am in excellent health and did exercise regularly.  I have not been able to do so since May of this year.

I actually stumbled across this page while looking to see what the symptoms of Fifth's disease are (my niece has it_ and it's got a very high infection rate: 60-80%).  I was simultaneously on Levaquin_ and initially figured that my stiffness and bone pain were related to the Fifth's.  Instead_ I'm finding out the Levaquin has an outrageous amount of side effects (at least anecdotally).  I can't believe how rotten I feel.  Walking feels like standing on broken bones.  All joints in my lower body ache_ and my sternum hurts on deep inflection.  Additionally_ my short term memory is completely (and hopefully temporarily) gone.  I was asked what I did this past weekend by a co-worker.  I knew I saw a movie_ but literally couldn't remember which movie I saw until I called my wife.  That was three days ago.

My toes go to sleep as I am walking and My toes are now spreading apart and are changing shape. It is hard to explain all the problems I am having.  This all took place 7 mths ago.  I fear it may never go away_ but I am hoping it will.  I finally had a nerve conduction study that was okay and a neurology exam that confirmed taking the medication_ Levaquin_ caused the problem.

Floxin also gives me severe nightmares.  Levaquin does none of this.  And it works.  And my yeast infections are even severe enough to warrant Diflucan afterwards.

1750, 1, Sinus Infection,Insomnia during the night and a zombie like state during the day. Effects occurred almost immediately following the use of one 500 mg tablet. By the second dose I experienced tightness in both calf muscles and soreness in all joints in right hand. Stopped after second dose due to lack of sleep (48 straight hours)  switched to a different antibiotic in a different class (one not containing fluoroquinolone) and have experienced no similiar side effects. I will also note that resulting effects from Levaquin use were gone after 24 hours and roughly 8 glasses of water.,I am a very healthy 24 year year at 63 and 195 pounds.  I have never experienced side effects from any antibiotic or any drug for that matter in my entire life.  It was the first time a course of Augmentin didnt totally clear a sinus infection for me and I was put on 30 days of Levaquin.  After two pills I was stunned by the severity of my side effects  the greatest being the complete inability to sleep.  I would not recommend this antibiotic to anyone.  If an antibiotic in the penicillin class has failed you_ try something in the cephalosporin class  a much safer class of antibiotics_ very effective_ and with the similar mild side effects of the penicillin class.,M,24,2  days,4/7/2006,Levaquin

I got an out of this world headache on top of the headache I already had. No joke_ this was the worst. It can only be attributed to this medicine. I have Fibromyalgia and I know joint pain and stiffness but this is beyond even that. This is pain. I've discontinued use of the medicine and hope to have it out of my system completely in a few days. This drug should NOT be on the market. I think prescribing it to the CEOs of the drug company that make it should solidify that. See how they feel after dealing with it's Minor side effects.

For the last month I've also been experiencing joint pain in one knee and one elbow.,This drug needs to be taken off the market.  As severe as I feel my reaction was_ it apparently does not hold a candle to what other people are suffering.  This is a dangerous drug and the first step is for the doctors to stop prescribing it.

1768, 1, Prostatitis,I was a very healthy  46 year old male with no preexisting conditions. After a two week course of Cipro and then unfortunately a seven week treatment with Levaquin I  developed the following conditions. Debilitating fatigue and weakness. Muscle pain_ joint pain_ tendon pain in my legs_ arms_ shoulders_ chest and back.  Muscle spasms all over my body that last for days and even weeks. Feeling like a low intensity electrical current is running through my legs at night. Not pins and needles but the feeling you get on your skin when your hair stands on end and at times this sensation moves up and down my body Insomnia is not a strong enough word_ total sleep deprivation is a more appropriate description. Mind racing_ feeling like Im on speed. Tremors_  shakiness in hands and legs_ loss of muscle coordination_ unsteady walk. Periods of rapid heart beat only controlled by medication_ high blood pressure. Dry skin_ my skin has aged ten years in only a few months,Periods of crushing anxiety and depression_ inability to handle any kind of stress with out resulting in anxiety. Unexplainable floaters in both eyes_ bright pinpoint flashes of light in my peripheral vision. Ringing in my ears_ metallic taste in my mouth. Trouble swallowing and chewing_ loss of appetite.  Total brain fog_ loss of memory_ mental confusion_ Trouble finding words.   Over all_ total loss of quality of life_ I am unable to work and have become house bond because of this drug. It has been two months since I took Levaquin_ some of these conditions have improved some and others have gotten worst. Some research I have done suggests that these symptoms are caused by Fluoride toxicity because Cipro and Levaquin are fluorinated compounds. I am going on a detox program in hopes that it will remove this toxic substances from my body. If that doesnt work all I can do is wait and pray. Good luck to everyone who reads this.PS.

By day 2 (and after 2nd dose) had severe weakness_ dizziness and MAJOR joint and muscle pain (because i had been sick_ i hadn't been training or working out for the past week_ so i knew it wasn't due to overuse or an injury). I hadn't read any of the side effects because doc just gave me samples and i didn't look into anything. because i had never experienced this kind of pain and weakness before_ I began to worry that my strep (which usually responds to z-pack_ but didn't this time) was somethign much worse. After I found out that these were side effects of the lev_ i stopped taking it (after 3rd pill). Almost passed out after 10 mins of very light training on day 3_ and now at day 5 (2 days of no meds)am still feeling the effects.,...I have tournaments coming up but have decided to take a few days off from training just because i don't want to get hurt while my joints/tendons are weaker. i've read several stories about patients tearing  tendons. not sure how likely it is... but better safe than sorry.3 days/750mg per dosethis totally killed my strep_ but the side effects are scary. hope to never need this again. will take lev only as a last-resort.,F,28,3  days,2/27/2006,Levaquin
1770, 1, Suspected Sinus Infection,Within hours I noticed a significant increase in anxiety_ but did not make the connection immediately.  By the next day I was very emotional_ anxious and could not sleep much.  By the 3rd day my anxiety and emotional state was approaching unstable but I had no idea why.  The anxiousness was not driven by any issues or thoughts_ which was strange to experience.  On the 4th day I realized the connection and after seeing a few sites on the internet_ there was no doubt that this was the cause.  It also reinflamed a joint in one of my toes for several days.  My Rheumatologist said that joint inflammation by Quinolones is common in many of his patients.,5 years earlier (1998) I took 10 days of Cipro for what was initially thought to be giardia.  Within hours I was extremely nervous to the point of shivering_ again I couldn't figure out why I was nervous.  Even those of us with a nervous disposition can figure out what thoughts may be driving elevated anxiety and emotional states.  On the 3rd day of this 10 day course of meds_ I called the doctor to explain the side effect but the nurse said it was best i finished it.  Worst thing I ever did.  A few weeks later (age 26) I suffered a stroke or something like it.  It's now believed that Cipro may have caused this.,M,34,4  days,2/23/2006,Levaquin

1780, 5, upper/lower respiratory  infection,"I'm a nurse who has had upper & lower respiratory infections for about a year.  I had two 7 day courses of Levaquin a few weeks apart.  The first course gave me no problems and I definitely felt better; the second course really seemed to actually ""cure"" me and I had two fabulous infection-free weeks (until the next head cold caused another upper and lower respiratory infection--yeah_ I've got immunological issues).  However_ during the second course of Levaquin_ I developed SEVERE joint pain.  I was fortunate--there are many who have had much worse (and permanent) problems with Levaquin (and all the other quinolones).  There are a lot of other forums on Levaquin/quinolones besides this one_ and if you take the time to look for them_ you will find that there are a lot of adverse side effects that have caused a lot of temporary and permanent problems for a lot of people.  You'll also find that there are a lot of doctors calling for more restrictions on the use of quinolones","Oh_ by the way_ I'm not a hypochondriac nor am I seeking to sue anyone.  And yes_ you'll probably find a lot of people on this forum who have negative things to say about Levaquin (or quinolones in general).  I don't think it's because these folks are ""hypochondriacs"" who have nothing better to do with their time than to log in to forums and complain about the drug they are taking.  I think a lot of them are like me--their doc prescribed a drug that seems to be causing a lot of problems that are not included in the ""adverse effects"" section of the medical info they were given with the prescription.  I got on-line to see if there were any others who were having severe problems like I was and_ well_ you know the rest of the story (all hail the power of the internet).

This is NOT normal.,The discomfort became so bad_ and was clearly intensifying each day that I began to look for causes and realized the only new med I was taking was levaquin.  It is 3 AM  and I can't sleep_ which has been going on for 5 days_ and I am here looking for causes and solutions.  I only wish I had put this together days ago and stopped taking it.,F,50,10  days,1/19/2006,Levaquin

I felt as if i had gone out of my mind.  Everything tasted weird.,I had the easy to handle body pain quickly. By the 6th day i woke up feeling out of it. I felt very shaky and achy. My heart was racing at times and then other times I felt as if I couldn't get enough air. It went away in the evening. Then i felt like i had the flu. The next morning I woke up extremely jittery. I couldn't sit still. I felt like i was going out of my mind. I was very depressed . I had stabbing pain throughout my right shoulder. I called my doctor and they said it isn't typical of levaquin. To be fair_ I was also on Cardec cough medicine and pseudovent. I took cipro a long time ago and lost feeling in my legs_ which i was told my my doc is a side effect of it. I am not a hypochondriac...everyone reacts differently to different medicines. I am not trying to make any money or anything. Just want to say what happened to me. I will stay away from it because i think it is just too strong for me.,F,33, ,1/19/2006,Levaquin
1793, 1, Bronchitis,"""Brain fog""_ strange/bad taste in mouth_ and extreme difficulty swallowing",My father (age 76) was prescribed Levaquin 10 days ago but stopped taking it today (day 8) on the advice of the doctor on-call for the prescribing doctor.Prior to taking Levaquin_ my father was extremely active and intelligent_ volunteered with many agencies and was well-respected among his friends and co-workers.  After 8 days on Levaquin_ he's a changed man--complains of brain-fog_ seems frail_ and now has trouble swallowing.   I thought perhaps the bronchitis had simply hit him hard_ but after reading this and several other websites concerning Levaquin side effects--and considering that the doctor-on-call immediately pulled him off Levaquin_ I now realize that his complaints were quite possibly caused by this drug.  I hope with all my heart that he recovers completely from the effects of Levaquin!,M,76,8  days,1/14/2006Email,Levaquin

1802, 1, Post bladder surgery,Insomnia - but I could tolerate that.  The evening of the third day of Levaquin_ I fell going up the steps due to weakness and dizziness.  Then in the evening of the fourth day of 500mg._ I stood up from my computer and immediately lost my balance in a sickening swirl of dizziness. Fell to the right_ into the wall. Tried to walk_ but by balance was off so badly that I couldn't stand up.  Was helped to bed_ but during the night my head spun.  I have had vertigo before due to inner ear problems_ but this was different.  With vertigo_ I experience nausea spinning.  With Levaquin_ it seems that I had no balancing mechanism.  Today (Jan 2_2006) I woke up with the same imbalance_ nausea_ headache.  Spent the day lying down after taking Meclizine ad Diazepam ordered by the doctor.  Took my Levaquin at 9:00 pm tonight and sat down at my computer to look up interactions of meds.  I'm also on 5 mg. prednisone a day.  Found this discussion of quinalone meds.

The options was to die with pnemonia or have nightmares_ few leg pains_ and little depression.

I am very tired all of the time and have had neurology work up for this.  Dr. stated it was side effect from levaquin>hopefully will eventually go away.

As my wife said_ ""It messed you up in the head."" I never realized that an antibiotic could cause cognitive problems. By day three of a ten day prescription_ I was feeling so weird that I started doing research on the internet to see if there was something about the drug that could be causing these strange symptoms_ and I came across this site. Needless to say_ I did not take anymore. It has been four days since my last dose_ and I still have a headache_ and I still don't feel quite right in the head.

1819, 1, Sinus/respiratory infection,Hallucinations_ abnormal thinking_ anxiety and abnormal EEG.,I do not recommend taking Levaquin for any reason.  I took Levaquin in July 2005 and am still having serious side effects from taking Levaquin along with Prednisone.  I had taken Levaquin previously in small doses and had no problems_ but this time I was given a larger dose and had a psychiatric reaction.  About 2-3 days after the first dose_ I woke up during the night terrified and hallucinating. I stopped taking it.  Although it is possible the Prednisone contributed to this reaction_ my doctors believe it was more likely the Levaquin. I had tests done and my EEG is abnormal suggesting a toxic drug reaction.  I strongly believe this drug should be taken off the market.  People need to be aware that Levaquin along with many other prescription drugs crosses the blood brain barrier. The blood brain barrier prevents chemicals from reaching the brain.  When a drug such as Levaquin crosses this barrier it can result in serious problems.

After stopping I blamed the AlleRx as the cause of the anxiety and dreams ... but after reading the board it might have been the Levaquin?  I know that the dreams are caused by restriction of the blood vessels in the brain and when one sleeps the blood is pulled to the head and chest.  I am not qualified to determine what drug did what ... so after discussing the problem with the Dr.  I got a shot of pennicillin and began irrigating my sinuses as I have in the past with a solution of water and GSE.  The problem is not gone_ but the dreams and anxiety,I guess I would error on the side that says... I am responsible for my health care.  My Dr and I are a team and if in our attempt to cure me of a medical malady... a pharmacologic error occurs... we log the result and move on to find a not threatening solution... is that process_ the INTERNET is my friend as it allows me to read about the great experiments that are being conducted as all of you take LEVAQUIN and other drugs.  I believe that if a person takes time to post thier experiences to this board rather than talk witht thier spouse_ family or friend... there must be something that impressed the poster about LEVAQUIN... good or bad.  Thanks to all who came and left a message... I got confirmation here that the reaction I had was NOT an isolated event as I was told by my DR.  He will get an email ... asking him to read these posts as part of his training in LEVAQUIN... an informed presciber is a better DR. Feeling better in Texas.,M,58,2  days,11/3/2005,Levaquin
1838, 4, diverticulitis,I was prescribed Levaquin in combination with Metronidazole.  I had taken metronidazole in the past and except for the vile aftertaste I had no noticable side effects.  The Levaquin made me feel dizzy_ and a bit tipsy.  I was relieved when a pharmacist advised me that Levaquin often has effects on CNS. I stayed home and took it easy while on Levaquin.  The patient information I received with Levaquin made no mention of dizzyness or disorientation as a possible side effect.,I have taken Levaquin for two courses of 14 days each in the past three years.  I felt tipsy each time_ although some days were not too bad. I feel it is an effective antibiotic_ so I am willing to tolerate the side effects.,F,54,14  days,10/30/2005,Levaquin

I don't recommend this drug_ teh side effects were worse than my symptoms.,The doctor prescribed this rather than 800mg of Augmentin because it is easier on the stomach.

On the morning of day 5 of 7 days of 500 mg per day_ woke up with severe joint and muscle pain. Went to a new doctor (mine was out of town) was told couldn't be the levaquin. Can you say quack?! Tested me for anything else. Nothing else could be blamed and was then told maybe we will never know. This was 3 weeks ago and I am just now starting to feel better. Will try to start my workouts again and hopefully will be okay. My regular doc is monitoring to make sure no permanent damage done to joints and tendons because he believes pain is from the medicine and the ER should never have pout me on it for 7 days.

That was 6 months ago. When I would have relief from the cough and the chest pain_ as soon as I had a sinus infection and the Doctor would again prescribe Levaquin_ I would become miserable again and the pain would again become severe in my chest and rib area. I have never experienced such misery. I would never advise anyone to take this medication and I agree that this type of information should be explained to you before spending a penny to buy this drug. My quality of life has been completely ruined and I am only 32 years old. This drug needs to be removed from the market!!!

1883, 1, cellulitis/staph infection,This drug was total poison to me.  I was put on 750 mg for 7 days on April 8_ 2005.  By the morning of the third day I went to get out of bed and screamed and fell back in bed for the excruciating pain in my knees.  This drug has given me an overall tendonitis in all my joints and muscles.  I was using a walker like a 90 year old woman ( I am 54).  Prior to taking this drug there was nothing wrong with me.  It is now July 30_ 2005 and I am still dealing with the residual effects of what this drug has done to me.  I am in pain all the time.  Have not been able to walk or move without a cane or walker.  I just cannot believe something that is supposed to help you can hurt you so much.  I have been depressed over the inability to go out and do any normal activity.  After a while it seemed to settle the worst in my right knee and in my left shoulder and arm.  It hurt just trying to lift my leg to put slippers on.  I have never experienced anything like this before.  I know many people have taken this with no problems_ but it has ruined my life.  I pray that it will eventually go away_ but many days I dont think it will.  I have been unable to work because my legs swell so badly and hurt when in a seated position.  I feel like a cripple and I know it was the Levaquin that has caused this.  I got another cellulitis infection and they put me on an antibiotic I have had before and I usually have joint pain_ swelling_ and fatigue with it_ but it has always resolved after stopping the medication in about five days_ but not this time. I am now almost back to where I was when I was on the Levaquin.  Back to using a walker_ lots of pain in my knees_ especially the right_ pain in left shoulders_ pain in elbows_ wrists_ fingers_ all the same pains that happened with the Levaquin.  I have taken this other antibiotic (Keflex) before without the side effects lasting this long.  I dont know what permanent damage this Levaquin may have done_ but it has been a nightmare for me.  I am glad for those who have not had to go through this.  For those like myself who have had major problems_ I feel for you.

I was in bed for two solid months in agony and now hobble around like an old woman.  I used to work out every day!,Ask your doctor for a safer drug_ this one causes long-lasting pain and debilitation.,F,32,4  days,4/13/2005,Levaquin

1955, 3, Bronchitis,Sleeplessness_ Nervousness_ Jittery. Felt overly emotional at times and mentally unalert. Fast heartbeat_ hard time breathing - of course this may be from bronchitis not the drug. Stopped taking after only 3 days of a 10 day prescription.,Overall_ I think it is a very powerful drug. It did help with my bronchitis symptoms a bit_ but too many side effects for me to handle. I would only recommend to people that have not gotten better by taking other antibiotics first. It's also very expensive.,F,29,3  days,4/7/2005,Levaquin

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DRUG. 750 mg - nothing less.,M,40,6  days,4/4/2005,Levaquin
1960, 5, sinus infection,Very satisfied because it cleared up the sinus infection in five days but will NEVER take again due to the mental side effects.  It felt like an acid trip!

Now_ I am almost sure from reading this.  Arm pain_ shoulder pain_ knee_ pain_ shin pain_ hip pain_ neck pain..... numbness_ pins and needles.,Works to clear up the sinus_ but then it comes back just after I stop.  I can't believe it took so long to feel this way_ with the amount of time I have been on it and the strength; I should win a prize or something!

All of the above I can deal with since it wiped out the sinus infection but the dose I took two days ago made me feel mentally insane!  I had some weird thoughts that sent me into an emotional meltdown.  I felt completely depressed and even thought about suicide!  No more for me!  That's the warning they should tape on the side of the pill bottle!  Or how about the doctors?  Shouldn't they give you a heads up on the,I would have rated Levaquin a 4 or 5 because aside from the mental side effects_ it just felt like you would feel after drinking a double espresso_ only for six hours.

1967, 4, sinus infection,I'd like to add a few comments more to the ones I already listed_ which were nervousness and insomnia. After day 3 at 750 mg/day_ I awoke with a splitting headache_ weak and sick and with difficulty breathing. I kept twitching in bed the night before_ and I had such trouble sleeping I thought about suicide and that's NOT me! I was seeing whitish flashes in my peripheral vision with eyes closed. On reflection_ I think this is a very dangerous drug of last resort and shouldn't be given to people for things like sinus infections. If you have even the slightest trouble with this drug of the nervous type_ ditch it now. Don't let your doctor ignore you. It's not a safe drug,I am going to tell people to stay away from it.,F,50,3  days,3/28/2005,Levaquin

Secondarily_ slight nausea an hour or so after taking. Only took three of the five doses_ having figured out why I wasn't sleeping. I have chronic pain and can't stand the sleeplessness on top of everything else.,I think it works well on the infection. My sinus symptoms were mostly better after day 3.

1974, 3, Possible prostate infection,A,My understanding is side-effects are rare if you take it for the approved 7-10 days_ but nearly inevitable if you take it for much longer.  I am not sympathetic to the view that if it doesn't fix you within 5 weeks_ it's not going to.  My first course of Levaquin last year (5 weeks) did alleviate my prostate symptoms perhaps 80%_ but this most recent course did nothing to fix the remaining 20% after 10 weeks.,M,50,70  days,3/24/2005Email,Levaquin
