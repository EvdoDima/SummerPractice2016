19, 2, Dvt_Ovt and pregnancy,Extreme hematomas_ pain_ and tenderness at the injection site. Have had to receive stitches for severe bleeding at injection site.  Mild nausea and vomiting. I was on arixtra for almost 2 years with no problems_ due to not becoming therapeutic on warfarin 6 months prior. Arixtra was perfect for me and the reason I had to switch to lovenox was due to my pregnancy. I have had 3dvts in my legs_ and 1 massive dvt on my ovary_ all of which while taking warfarin. I would recommend arixtra to anyone currently on lovenox because of less side effects. As I became further along in my pregnancy_ pinching skin was harder than ever_ and I was allowed other injection sites besides my stomach_ but with the same results_ horrible hematomas that required stitches. Very disapointed with this drug_ mainly because I've seen how blood thinners don't have to interfere with your daily life. For everyone who reads this and is dissatisfied with lovenox_ but doesnt know of anything better_ ask your doctor about arixtra!,,F,28,9  months120mg,1/1/2012Email,Lovenox (preservative free)

Minimal bruising (so far).,I found it helps out with minimizing the bruising if you sit down_ grab your stomach fat and put the needle in at a 90 degree angle vs. laying down and doing it.I miscarried after 3 months and the oncologist is hoping that this will help.  I knew I had factor V_ but didn't know about the other one until he retested me for a bunch.

To continue taking I spaced at 18 hrs.beginning w/the fifth dose. 2)at 2 weeks (spaced at 18 hrs.) experienced intense arthritis throughout my body. Have continued with 24 hr spacing.,I also have had bruising_ headaches and fatigue. This drug has a half life of 12 hours and stays in an average person's body for 96 hrs.or more. so each additional dose increases the concentration.

Itchy red rash_ worse all over abdomen_ spreading to my scalp_ legs_ arms_ crotch...horrible!,The rash went away within two days after stopping Lovenox.  Luckily my INR was in therapeutic range and I will be able to continue on Coumadin only.  My fear is that I will develop another clot...hope I am not allergic to drugs similar to Lovenox(like heparin).  The injections were not pleasant.

49, 4, Antiphospholipid Syndrome,"Bruising_ hematomas_ soreness until I experimented and became adept at giving myself the shots. Anyone who complains of these things would be wise to experiment and ask several nurses to demonstrate proper technique. I noticed someone here saying things improved for them AFTER they began pinching the skin while giving the injection. No subcutaneous should EVER be given without pinching the site. There's no way to avoid bruising and huge lumps if you aren't pinching the skin at the injection site. Those who complain of the liquid being ""painful"" need to pinch tighter.  Done correctly_ there is virtually no pain associated with this injection unless you happen to hit some nerves.  In this case_ pull out and move slightly.",Give the injection slowly. Count to 30 quickly while giving the injection slowly -- very slowly. Always pinch the skin. When finished_ hold the needle where it is and count to 5 quickly.  Pull it out a little and count to 10 quickly.  Then slowly remove it the rest of the way.  NEVER rub the injection site BEFORE or AFTER giving yourself the injection.  You'll bruise heavily_ get hematomas_ and experience pain as a result.  This really should be no big deal. If it is_ you're doing it wrong.,F,54,1  years120 mg 2X D,3/27/2010Email,Lovenox (preservative free)

Slightly more rapid heartbeat 10 mins or so after injection - could be anxiety/paranoia? Tiny bit of bleeding after injecting.,DVT after longhaul flight from Hawaii_ to London Heathrow_ then Newcastle in close succession_ had recently taken birth control pill dianette at time. Now pregnant Lovenox offered as precaution given my history. Instructed to inject on side of thigh_ not belly- started treatment at 23 weeks pregnant and will continue until 24 hrs before birth and afterwards also I expect as post=partum DVT just as much as a risk I heard.

I am also on Coumadin taking 15mg a day regardless of if I have to give myself shots,Because i have a rare blood disorder (less then 1% of the population have it) i am required to have my INR tested twice a week right now_ when its where it should be i dont have to give myself shots_ but i find the side effects are more apparent_ i have only been off them for a day so far_ next week i go back to get my blood tested to see if my INR is still where it should be if not i have to take shots_ Im taking Coumadin as well and it seems that when im not on the shots the symptoms are worse.  I am a Lifer of these two drugs_ something im going to look into is a Homeopathy item called ARNICA MOTANA_ its made from a plant and when taken oraly it CAN help with blood clots and work with Coumadin_ im going to take what i found to my Doctor and get his take on it.

About 3 wks later developed blood clot same place.  Dr said he was going to take my leg off 2 inches above my knee.  I said I wanted a second opinion.  Went to Baylor in Dallas.  Diagnosed with APS.  Dr put me on Lovenox injections every 12 hrs.  Took blood clot out and took vein from left leg and placed in right leg...also had to have my big toe amputated_ due to lack of circulation.

64, 4, Pre-electrical cardioversion,Just prior to cardioversion because of my atrial fibrillation_ the doctor discovered that my INR was too low_ so I received two Lovenox injections in my stomach_ quite painful and caused bruising_ and then I had to give myself injections afterwards at home_ too.  Nothing I would ever want to do for long.  Had a trans-esophageal echocardiogram prior to the cardioversion and somehow my tongue was traumatized (it looked like I may have badly bitten it somehow_ but I was under Twilight anaesthetic) and due to the thinned blood_ I bled profusely INTO my tongue and the next day after I got home it looked like a killer whale filling up the whole inside of my mouth (my tongue was black and blue and HUGELY swollen).  I went to the ER and the doctor said this was life-threatening_ because the swelling tongue could block my airway.  However_ it stopped short of that.  It was a horrible thing to experience_ very frightening and prevented me from eating any solid food (there was no room in my mouth,I downgraded the score to a 4 because even though it did exactly what it was supposed to do_ I definitely didn't like the idea of having to inject myself with it.

Was on lovenox for a few months after_ then switched to coumadin. I preferred the coumadin over the shots_ but hated the restrictions on my diet and weekly monitoring. Being on lovenox is great because of the lack of monitoring and diet control. But the pain can be unbearable. I am back on lovenox due to being pregnant and with my belly getting bigger I am freaking out as to where to do it next?!? I tried a different method of injection where you clear out bubble_ tighten the skin (with index and thumb) and inject slowly the only pain afterwards was the injection site_ unlike many other times having pain from the medication or hematomas etc. So far seems easier to find good spots this way.. hopefully it will continue for the next 5 months that is all I have left to be on this.

Freezing a washcloth and holding to site before giving shot and after helps with pain and brusing.,I lost a baby in the past at full term_ they think being due to a gene mutation with my blood clotting. So to be careful I don't lose this one they have put me on Lovenox 40mg everyday_ on top of a baby asprin of 81mg a day_ 3 doses of calcium and vitamin d a day_ and my prenatal vitamins. The shot doesn't hurt going in just the medicine hurts-like a bee sting-going in. Sometimes I have no brusing and sometimes only light brusing_ sometimes it never hurts to touch the area the day after and other times it does. This is my third pregnancy and it has been the best pregnancy I have ever had-I always felt great and wonderful. After starting these shots though I feel tired_ no energy_ mild to painful headaches_ don't feel well for hours after taking shot_ rapid heartbeat after taking shot_ anxiety after taking shot_ but worst of all my nasal passages are swollen and blocking so I can't breath at all-on top of my nose constantly running-severe mucus.

Convenient prefilled dispensing which I like compared to sub cutaneous heparin and oral coumadin_ both I have done for long periods of time during and after multiple pregnancies.

I have woken with headaches every day of use and have had several episodes of significant diarrhea_ this is the highest dose I have used at .4 vs .3.  I removed the air from the chamber before injecting lovenox_ but was not clear if this was necessary.

To lessen the burn I inject lovenox VERY slowly (if you don't have steady hands don't try it). Sometimes the syringes aren't sharp enough and the skin is hard to puncture. My doctors did not warn me of any of the side effects prior to me starting lovenox_ they just said some people have very strong reactions and some people have little to no reactions while on lovenox and never said what possible reactions were.,I was taking warfarin but never had a stable INR and developed a PE when my INR was 4.0 so I will most likely be a lovenox lifer. Compared to coumadin/warfarin I prefer lovenox because it does not have the numerous drug interactions_ its pregnancy safe and doesn't require as much monitoring. Lovenox can be a much stronger anticoagulant than coumadin and isn't easily reversed if your blood is too thin (i.e You can't just take vitamin K or be given FFP like you can with coumadin if your too thin) .

78, 4, DVT,I developed a DVT in my R lower calf in my sleep during a long haul flight. I was now in Sydney and began with Clexane injections which it's called here Lovenox. It helped getting rid of the pain in my calf immediatly....but I adopted other symptoms which I've never had before. I'm very fit. The symptoms are:- Headaches_tiredness_sleepy_fatigue_a nasty taste in my mouth_shortness of breath_over all not feeling well and sure not feeling like myself_sweats_my body just doesn't want to move(I'm very atheletic) been on this injections HAS made a huge difference to my energy levels. At first I was OK with the injections_ it was easier because your doses are correct for your body weight without having to do blood work all the time. The Dr. here in the States have just started me on Coumadin/Warfrin which I'm hoping will make me feel better even though blood work will be required 2x per week then once a week to 10 days.....neither are great but treatment is neccessary.It is very important NOT,"Clexane/lovenox injectables are painful! The Dr. told me ""no big deal it doesn't hurt"" or ""any side effects"" but there is. It burns badly like a bee sting. It's not the injection or the needle part it the fluid that goes in. Let the air out first of your injection(even thought they tell us not to) it helps a lot....pinch the site/fat on your stomach and at 90 degrees injected the site then release the skin once the needle is in  slowly push the fluid in. Put compression immediatetly on the site once injection is removed...if you try and walk immediatly it may really hurst even more as you can feel the fluid moving into a certain area depending how close to the hip or belly button you are_ give yourself a little time....it's unpleasant!

After 8 miscarriages_ they figured out I have Antiphosolipid syndrome and I am currently 13 weeks with my baby.  Numb the injection site first and it makes the injection far more bearable.  We also found that taking the air out decreased the pain drastically!,F,32,1  years,6/21/2007,Lovenox (preservative free)
108, 4, History of 2 DVTs,slight bruising around injection site,"I was originally put on Lovenox as a ""bridge"" until my Coumadin (warfarin) levels were therapeutic - but my INR never was correct_ so they've kept me on Lovenox. I admit_ the daily shots can seem daunting_ but it's better than dealing with coumadin and getting bloodwork everyweek to determine if the drug is actually working. This is so much easier - two shots a day and you're money!",F,26,6  months,6/9/2007,Lovenox (preservative free)
109, 4, DVT Right Leg,Abdomen @ point of injection site bruses and hurts for a long peroid of time.

110, 1, knee replacement surgery,I went into anaphylactic shock on this drug!  I had at least 2 seizures_ and nearly died.  It began with nightmares_ then seizure; water standing on my body_ trouble breathing; loss of bladder control; milk and coffee tasted thick as syrup; metallic taste; weakness/faintness; fading of vision/light.,For me_ this is a very dangerous drug.  My doctor had only been using it for 2 months_(I suspect by way of 'incentives' from drug company)_ and because it was a holiday weekend_ he was unavailable to treat me or to tell me to get off the drug.,F,68,5  days,2/22/2007Email,Lovenox (preservative free)
111, 5, pregnancy,I have a burning sore throat_ off and on every day for 3 wks_ with a metallic taste and wonder if this is from the lovenox since I'm not taking anything else.  The injections are easy_ only bruise occasionally.,,F,35,1  months,1/3/2007,Lovenox (preservative free)

113, 3, DVT & Pulmonary Embolism,Severe leg and abdominal muscle cramps; lumps at injection site; pain from injections,The injections are just too much of a hassle_ and at some injection sites_ the fat breaks down and hardened spots on the abdomen result.

116, 5, pregnancy,I found Lovenox to bruise a lot less than Heparin which I found unbearable.  Heparin left huge bruises and when you're taking two a day you run out of room quickly.  I thought the Lovenox stung more but the decrease in bruising was well worth it.  I'm taking it again while on Depot Lupron therapy and its only for two weeks.  I am tired of it already!,9 Months2 Weeks,F,41, ,7/14/2005Email,Lovenox (preservative free)
