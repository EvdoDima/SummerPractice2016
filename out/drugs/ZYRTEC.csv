3, 1, Hay Fever,I ended up getting huge itchy welts all over my body. It took a while to realize that it was the Zyrtec causing it because why would an antihistamine produce a horrible allergic reaction like that! As soon as I stopped taking it the welts went away and I even tried taking it another time because I still found it weird that it would cause an allergy when it treats allergies! The itchy welts came back. If I scratched them_ it was almost impossible not to_ they would increase to 2 inches in diameter. It was horrible.,,F,38,14  days1 pill 1X D,7/22/2016,Zyrtec

5, 1, Allergies,I didn't have side effects until I ran out of Zyrtec for a couple days. I started itching and feeling sick. It was easy to guess that this was the culprit. Then i went online and started reading how toxic this drug is. About day 3 my itching and sneezing was out of this world. I have clawed and scratched my skin off and have hives on my chest and neck. I refuse to give in and take another one. I'll be half dead and miserable or go to the hospital one...but i won't ever take this again. Poison_ not to mention makes you retain water and gain weight.

I didn't take Zyrtec last night because I'm so sick of not getting any sleep and don't want to risk developing any other problems and I really hope it goes well.

Mild headache and dizziness.,"To be fair_ I don't find the words ""non-drowsy"" anywhere on Zyrtec's web site_ so I can't claim they misled me.  But for me_ the drowsiness and fatigue caused by this medication has been so overwhelming and long-lasting that it's worse than useless.  I'd only touch this stuff in the event of a literally life-threatening allergic reaction_ and then only if I can't get my hands on an EpiPen.Worse_ it didn't seem to do much for my rash.",M,43,3  days10mg 1X D,6/25/2016,Zyrtec

I run 5 miles a day x5 days a week and was surprised at this sudden increase in weight and bloating.  Also triggered an increase in hunger.  Never experienced psychological issues (mood swings_ insomnia_ irritability_ anxiety_ depression) before until I started taking this drug. Although the psychological symptoms are mild_ they are still upsetting.  These side effects started about 1 week after I started taking it.

Words are indescribable the wonders this site has done for me as I was not sure what was going on with me.

22, 3, Running Nose_ Sneezing and Watery E,I am not sure but it might be related to Zyrtec with vision changes_ giving me a crazy looks; unable to look people in the eyes. Also_ I noticed my feet ankles being swollen and I do not consuming that much of salt diets. I thought Zyrtec_ and other Allergy-related drugs are not supposed to cause such harm as others have commented on its use. According to my Ear and Throat doctor_ Zyrtec and other related Allergy Meds and Sprays should be safe since they do not go through one's bloodstream but showed otherwise. With all these negatives being noted about Zyrtec and other Allergy drugs_ I as a person with allergies do not know else what to take.  ,If an adult person is experiencing such severe problems_ what about children_ babies (toddlers) for that matter_ who are unable to express their feelings_ is very devastating; Zyrtec and others similar to it need monitoring and regulating by the Food Drug Administration or any other departments responsible to oversee drugs usage.,F,54,  1X AN,3/10/2016,Zyrtec

Given this by doctor,"Heart racing_ anxious_ feeling uncoordinated_ dizzy_ feeling ""drunk"" while walking_ shaking_ dry mouth.",I don't have enough words for what this medication has done to me. I was standing in church today looking like a drunk (BTW I don't drink). My movement was so slow. I had to hold on to walls the last five days. My coworkers didn't want me driving and I haven't driven in two days. And today_ to top it off_ I thought my heart was going to race out of my chest. I would have never thought an allergy medicine could cause such issues. I haven't played with my son because I can't do it. I finally spent the whole day doing research. Why is this medicine an OTC when its so dangerous? I thought I was losing it! There are so many people saying what it does wrong to them. I still don't really have the coordination to type this.

After taking it for a few days_ I experienced sleep paralysis for the first time in my life. Since I had just started taking this medicine_ I decided to look up other side effects of zyrtec. I couldn't believe that an allergy medication could cause something as horrible as sleep paralysis_ but apparently I'm not the only one who experienced it. Also_ I noticed that i was really out of it the few days I was taking this but I didn't think anything of it until recently. Also I was a lot more anxious than usual.

He did not sleep well at night and took him forever to get to sleep. I took him off the Zyrtec to see what would happen and all of his symptoms went away.

It did relieve my allergies_ and the doctor said it was best to take it consistently_ so I was. While on this_ I seriously thought about hurting myself_ I thought about hurting my husband_ and I had completely unreasonable thoughts and reactions to people. I have never been in such a dark place in my head. Soon after I stopped taking Zyrtec_ I was back to normal. This is scary stuff_ and I can't believe it's on the market.

I'm not one to take medication so I took it only when I  felt I needed it.  I took most of medication during the day and noticed with I took the first dose it made me feel anxious and my heart  started to race a bit..  Can't take any decongestants because it makes my heart race.  So I thought this was okay to take.  Took it on another occasion at around 6 in the evening.  When I went to bed around 10 and laid down to go to sleep I felt very nervous and anxious.  Took my heart rated and it felt as though I was out jogging_  About 4 in the morning my heart rate finally slowed to normal.  Took the bottle to my Dr. and told him to put it on my allergy list.

After 3 months I felt worn out_ weak muscles and having a sense of confusion_ tight pressure in my head and then the vertigo hit me two weeks ago today. I have stopped taking Zyrtec and never want to use it again.,Stopping Zyrtec is awful. The itching is so intense and a new one - my lips have been swollen all day. This is day 3 of withdrawal.

However the vertigo still comes intermittently especially if I lie down but triggers vary - a nightmare. I hope it isnt going to be permanent and that my lips will go back to normal.

39, 1, Uncontrollable allergies,Headache_ dry mouth_ dry eyes_ fatigue_ restlessness_ sleep disturbance_ difficulty breathing upon exertion (even walking up steps)_ rapid heart beat during cardio exercise,"I took this medication after my loratadine did not work for my fall allergies.  They have been bad this year and I needed to look for something new after not being able to control a persistent hacking cough for over three weeks.  Right away I noticed this medication made me tired.  Not unexpected and for the relief I needed I could deal with that. Then I noticed my mouth and eyes became extremely dry.  Since it helped to dry up some of my congestion and  seemed to offer me some relief_ I thought ""I can deal"".  I am a very active person and exercise (cardio_ weights_ biking and running) regularly and I noticed that the mouth dryness became pretty intense during exercise_ no matter how much water I drank (and I usually have 64 ounces of water or more pre exercise).  It felt like I had a dry sponge in my mouth.  On top of that_ when I was active I noticed I needed to take frequent breaks to catch my breath and to help the feeling that my heart was going to thump out of my chest subside.  I felt winded even walking up stairs.  No thank you to all of that!  Plus_ I quickly noticed that when I tried to sleep my legs felt restless and my sleep quality was poor.  All of these things are very unlike me.  I went off the Zyrtec-D three days ago and onto a natural allergy relief product and already feel a world better!  I know my body well and just over a week of Zyertec-D was enough for my to know this OTC medication has serious side effects that may not be desirable.",F,41,1  weeks5mg/ 120 m 2X D,10/23/2015Email,Zyrtec

If you have metabolic problems it will increase the intensity of side effects such as extreme somnolence_ agitation and dry mouth as the drug will stay in your system longer.Using the drug has been very effective over the years. I was originally prescribed this over 10 years ago for chronic red-eye and found it was_ when taken consistently for a 1-2 weeks will improve  inflammation and will remain effective for a period of upto a month.The problem with taking zyrtec for this amount of time is the side effects become much more noticeable and compound to the point where I have to decide on to continue or stop taking zyrtec for a time.After continual doses over a few days i become agitated_ have confused dreams_ and lose sleep. The immediate side effect is extreme somnolence that persists for hours or days after the last dose if i havent taken it for a period of time. Yes_ zyrtec is a life saver for my conditions but it comes at a cost of effectiveness vs side effects.

During that month I felt like my heart rate was over 100 most of the time. I was depressed and had severe debilitating anxiety. I simply could not function and most mornings couldn't physically leave the house to go to work. When I was at work I would go into the toilet cubicle and be unable to walk out of there. It was frightening being like that. I would cry for no reason despite not being a crier. Normal situations were starting to cause extreme anxiety to the point where I would just want to shut myself away from the world all the time.It took WEEKS for me to get back to normal after taking it_ so don't be alarmed if you're not back to your old self in just a few days.This drug gave me the worst month of my life.

50, 4, Seasonal Hay Fever,Dry nose_ nasal crusting_ blood in nose_ mild drowsiness,This stuff works well on hay fever_ maybe a little too well because I can only take half a pill and I'll be good for about 3 days. It does make me a little bit drowsy so I take it at night_ sometimes I wake up and feel fine_ other times I've felt a bit foggy but it wears off. It also dries up my nose because it's strong_ I get a lot of crusting and blood due to the dryness. However these side effects are tolerable and better than having bad hay fever.,M,27,3  months 2X W,8/28/2015Email,Zyrtec
51, 1, Seasonal allergies,Daily drowsiness_ severe funk_ increased appetite.,I was so relieved when I came across this site!  Just spent an entire weekend in a horrible funk!!!!  It's Monday and I couldn't even work from home.  It's like my brain was sleeping.  I gave up and slept for 2 hours after a full 8 hours of sleep the night before.  I am normally a high energy person so I thought I was losing my mind until I realized the only change is I started Zyrtec last week and was told by the pharmacist for best results take it daily.  He said for best results take it everyday whether you're experiencing symptoms or not.  When I woke up I decided to Google Zyrtec side effects and it wasn't until I found these consumer comments that I know to quit taking Zyrtec!!!!!,F,45,7  days10 mg 1X D,8/24/2015,Zyrtec
52, 1, Year round indoor outdoor allergies,Irritability_ severe depression_ lethargy.,On this for probably 15 years after trying so many others that either didn't do the job of muting the allergies or their side effects were completely unbearable from the start. While Zyrtec works for the most part_ I did notice that my body wasn't responding to the anti allergy effect as well- still suffered on this. Went off a few weeks ago because the depression is changing who I am - and I feel like I actually went ON an antidepressant_ it's that much of a difference being OFF this drug. Into week 2 1/2 or 3 without: hands are swelling_ hot and itching like crazy- feet to a lesser degree. Been reading that this is common withdrawal. We take these pills for years like its nothing but the withdrawal is evidence that we've become dependent on it.,F,40,10  years,8/15/2015,Zyrtec
53, 1, Seasonal allergies,My son was experiencing seasonal allergies and rashes due to moving into a rental that previously had cats and dogs. After many sleepless nights of scratching himself to the point of bleeding_ I took him to an allergist who recommended 5 mg of Zyrtec each day. I had him taking 1/2 of the dissolvable tablets with no noticeable side effects. A few days ago I switched to the liquid and he's been an emotional wreck. He's unable to cope with any changes or upsets. He has thrown several tantrums that last for an hour or mor_ and he also started waking up in the middle of the night screaming from nightmares. My husband suggested it may be the Zyrtec and low and behold_ I find this thread. I will never use Zyrtec or any other allergy medication after reading the experiences on this site. Thank you for all of your helpful stories.,,M,3.5,1  months5mg,7/29/2015,Zyrtec
54, 3, hayfever symptoms,Itchy toes_ others I'm not sure about. It also isn't absolutely successful in stopping hayfever symptoms_ mine were only reduced.,I've taken a generic version of Zyrtec for about 3-4 years_ often missing doses and only taking pills when I felt symptoms coming on_ so I can't be certain of the links between it and my experiences. I also take it far more regularly in winter than in summer. I found many negative reviews about Zyrtec a couple of days ago_ and many side effects described were eerily similar to what I've experienced these past couple of years. Bad temper_ mood swings_ depression_ insomnia and sleeping too much were things I noticed in the colder seasons_ which I used to always pin on just being a teenager/the weather etc. It's currently winter where I am_ and to test my theory_ I stopped taking Zyrtec yesterday. Today_ I feel different_ anxious_ I woke up much earlier this morning than usual_ and I think I have itchy hives on my toes_ which I used to always take Zyrtec for after noticing it.  I'll update this review later on.,F,17,3  years10mg 1X D,7/16/2015Email,Zyrtec

She just told me today she gets this feeling in her that makes her mad and want to hit people_scream_& throw things. This is not our little girl at all. I seriously think it is the Zyrtec because she was never like this until she was put on it. School she is stil quiet and shy but I am afraid she is going to start acting out and I do not want that for my child.

I take 1 Zyrtec at night_ right before bed due to the extreme drowsiness it causes if I take it during the day. I am a certified nutritionist and adhere to an extremely regimented diet and exercise plan. I have a ton of self control when it comes to diet and exercise and typically maintain a weight of 115 lbs. Over the last 2 months I have gained 10+lbs without a single change to my routine. Over the last 2 months my weight has been slowly creeping up. So I have increased my cardio and reduced my calories even farther and my weight will not budge! I cannot even fit into my pants anymore! I was so desperate for answers that I thought I may have a thyroid disorder. Over the last week I have been racking my brain trying to figure out what is wrong_ but now it all makes sense. Zyrtec really helped my allergy symptoms however it will ruin your life!Update: Stopped taking Zyrtec cold turkey. Day 1: terrible splitting headache and nausea with frequent urination.

67, 1, over active histamine response,Anger. Unreasonable_ aggressive and uncooperative behavior,My 15y/o son started taking 24 hr Allegra prescribed by his pediatrician for an over active histamine response causing periods of extreme itching especially after showering. He took it for over a year without a problem and it worked well. The pediatrician suggested seeing an allergist who suggested switching to 24 hr Cetirizine_ which is generic Zyrtec. My now 16y/o started taking 24 hr Cetirizine in Feb 2015. We saw an unbelievable change in his personality with escalating anger and finally rage. He was frightening_ distructive and uncontrollable. After discussion with healthcare providers we discovered the change in his behavior coincided with starting Cetirizine. We stopped the 24 hr Ceterizine and restarted the 24 hr Allegra immediately. Within a day we saw his behavior retuning to baseline_ which is typical teen behavior but the without the extreme anger and volitility. We did not tell my son why we were changing the medication but he was in favor of the change because he felt he did not get adequate symptom relief from the 24 hr Cetirizine. Our family is still recovering from our two month ordeal. Stay away from Cetirizine.,M,16,2  months10mg 1X D,5/14/2015Email,Zyrtec

73, 1, seasonal allergies,I took Zyrtec for just about two weeks. As each day passed_ a new side effect would arrive. The first thing I noticed was very vivid dreams... nothing scary or violent_ but I never remembered my dreams before taking this medicine. Next_ fatigue_ irritability_ drowsiness and I felt shaky and weak at times. I felt like I gained weight instantly. I was hungry all day long_ to the point where I always carried around something small to eat because I was actually anxious and afraid of passing out. Finally_ after about 10 days_ severe anxiety and feelings of hopelessness and early signs of depression. I've never been a depressed person_ but this medicine made me feel awful.,It's been 36 hours since I've taken my last dose of Zyrtec. I don't feel completely better yet_ but definitely better than I did. I usually do my research before I take any medications_ and I'm very disappointed in myself for not doing that with Zyrtec. I had no idea a simple OTC allergy medication could make me feel so awful. I've used Allegra in the past and I never had any of these issues. The only reason I switched to Zyrtec was because a doctor at the local walk-in recommended it over Allegra and Claritin. After this experience_ I probably won't ever take an allergy medication again. I would rather just deal with the runny nose_ itchy eyes and sneezing. I'm hoping this Zyrtec gets out of my system soon. It's an overall terrible product. I would rate it a 0 if that was an option.,M,22,2  weeks10mg 1X D,4/27/2015Email,Zyrtec

Was able to breathe through my nose again_ didn't suffer wheezing/itching all the time_ slept so well.  But now that I've learned that it may be the cause of my weight gain_ I stopped taking it one week ago to see if the weight will drop off.  I feel awful- insomnia finally waning_ wheezing_ stuffy nose_ and extreme histamine reactions to foods causing swelling of the tongue and throat- food I ate daily with no reactions whatsoever.

I took one again last night (two days after the second dose) and felt extremely combative with my boyfriend and had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. This morning I still felt angry and was having lots of doom and gloom thoughts. The anger transitioned into depression and feeling physically like I had been run over by a steamroller. I wondered if I had caught the flu. I took a 2-hour nap and when I woke up_ I could hardly move my body. Am feeling a bit better_ although still a little off_ almost 24 hours after the last dose.

106, 1, Seasonal Allergies,Intense rage_ anger_ and mood changes.,Started taking Zyrtec in May to combat seasonal allergies. Last year was extremely bad for me_ so I wanted to get a head start on anything that would stop me from being miserable. After a few months of taking Zyrtec I started getting uncontrollable rage and anger when mildly arguing or confronted by friends_ family_ and co-workers. The rage and anger was so intense_ it even scared me. During an argument/fight_ I would seriously want to physically hurt the person I was fighting with_ something that I have never truly felt. I sincerely thought I was losing my mind and going crazy. I've never felt that kind of anger. I went to my doctor and explained what was going on - I assumed it was hormonal and connected to my periods - it HAD to be! Next I was referred to a psychotherapist for changes in mood. Was told it was the stress at my job_ anxiety_ etc. When my allergies never really came about this season_ I realized I should just stop taking Zyrtec - what's the point if I'm not sneezing/miserable? So_ I stopped taking Zyrtec for about two weeks. Then I took Zyrtec randomly one evening after sneezing all day and the next day I was a crazy_ psychotic_ rage monster. It was then that I finally realized the correlation between the drug and my mood. I have been off Zyrtec for about one month. All rage/anger/mood change symptoms are gone. This drug should NOT be OTC. It took away two months of my life and made me feel beyond crazy. I never even considered that allergy medication could e,F,33,3  months10mg 1X D,8/13/2014,Zyrtec

135, 3, Severe Allergies,My 5 year old son has been taking zyrtec for 2 years for severe allergies (tactile_ seasonal and severe life-threatening allergies).  He isn't able to leave the house without allergy medicine due to his high sensitivity to animal dander and other allergens.  Many of my son's classmates have pets at home and_ as soon as he comes into contact with them or their clothing_ his eyes swell up and become itchy and red.  Hives & asthma can also accompany these symptoms.  The zyrtec allowed my son to get out the door every day and function without these allergic reactions.  His pediatric allergist suggested I give it to him every day and that is where it all began.  The zyrtec did do the job it was intended to do_ I just don't think it is good for long term use (like any drug_ it has it's side effects).,I decided do a trial run of taking my son off of zyrtec after stumbling across many parents postings about irritability and mood changes they noticed while their child was taking zyrtec.  Throughout my sons 2+ years of daily doses of zyrtec_ his moods have swung from happy to sad within seconds.  He also would have sudden screaming outbursts if he didn't like something we told him (something as simple as 'let's go to the park').  We're on Day 4 without zyrtec and my son (after 2 years of this roller coaster!) is starting to be much more reasonable and cooperative_ and happy.  He certainly still has his moments (let's remember_ he's a 5 year old!) but we're noticing a huge difference already.  I haven't heard one screaming outburst since we stopped zyrtec.  Now we're focusing on the unbelievable itching he's experiencing at nighttime and trying to get through the next 2-3 weeks as his system is going through zyrtec withdrawal.  We tried taking him off of zyrtec 6 months ago for allergy testing and we couldn't get through it due to the extreme itching.  This time I'm determined to get past this phase and have been giving him a homeopathic allergy medicine every 4 hours throughout the night.  I also give him a dose of the homeopathic allergy medicine in the morning before school and I'm happy to say he's done just fine with his allergies (he only has a 1/2 day of kindergarten so I'm fortunate I can monitor all this).

145, 1, allergies,When my son was very young he took Zyrtec for his allergies.  During this time_ the smallest thing would make him get extremely upset and angry.  He would throw a fit for a couple hours and nothing we could do would settle him.  He had no pain tollerance as well.  Our older child had to have perfect behavior with him because anything could set him off.  It got so bad I thought I was going to have to take him to a therapist.  He had been such an easy going child before this.  Fortunately he was a very articulate child and during these episodes he would be crying saying he couldn't control how he felt and didn't know why he was so angry.  I read a blog that others had written about the same reaction_ unable to control anger and no pain tolerance. I immediately took him off the Zyrtec and he returned immediately back to his sweet easy going self. He has been off it for about 7 years now and is the sweetest child you could ever meet.

151, 1, Severe allergies_ hives,I moved to an area where I suddenly developed terrible seasonal allergies to trees_ weeds_ grass_ and mold. It felt like I had a cold all the time with stuffy nose_ itchy eyes and eyes_ runny nose attacks_ and hives. Then it became a food allergy where I had an itchy throat after eating fresh cantelope and carrots. So I started taking one zyrtec d in the morning and one zyrtec at night. And it was amazing how well it worked. All of the symptoms went away and I felt normal. But over the years my body has changed and I am finally realizing that this is all from the zyrtec. I developed dermatitis that no dermatologist could explain. As a woman this was devastating because my skin was rough_ dry_ and itchy. So I figured I was reacting to make up with my allergies. Then I developed acid reflux_ and my joints ache and pop. I only pee 3 times a day and I just feel sluggish and have a hard time sleeping. So I even did a sleep study and got a cpap machine that didn't work! So i slowly ran out of pills and was in the midst of moving and didn't have time to get more. I decided to try not taking them and I've noticed a HUGE difference. My skin is normalizing_ I'm peeing 7-8 a day_ my joints feel better. I am getting out of the itchy phase but it wasn't terrible since I was itchy when I was on zyrtec. And I have had crazy vivid nightmares and trouble sleeping. Hopefully it goes away soon.

I recently stopped taking it due to the realization that I didn't need allergy medicine year round and its a financial burden. I have never experienced withdrawal symptoms from a drug in my life_ but on day 3 of no zyrtec I experienced hell. I had unbearable itching all over my body_ from my fingertips to my scalp_ to my eyelids_ and the inside of my toes. You name it_ it itched. The itching was so bad I made myself bleed from scratching. Then the nausea hit. I could only keep down a few bites of food and that's it. I started having blurred vision which led to vertigo. I am currently on day 5 of no zyrtec and the itching is still severe. The only thing I want to do is get zyrtec off the market. I went to the doctor to see if there was anything to do for the discomfort_ and he told me to begin taking zyrtec again. No one believes that an allergy med can have withdrawal symptoms_ but thank God for forums like this. I don't feel like I'm crazy anymore.

Well_ if you or your child is taking this ""poison"" get off of it immediately.  It will turn you into a devil.  There is not enough time or space to describe the details_ but my son would ""zone"" out and become extremely violent trying to harm himself and us.  Fortunately_ he was young and small enough for us to control.  After 48 hours off this poison_ he was a different person.  He has been off this for 4 years and over time he hasn't had any meltdowns or anger problems.  If you have a child taking this now and can't control their anger_ stop giving it to them immediately.

My arms and legs felt like lead_ and I started to be extremely tired. I felt some loss of coordination as well_ ended up dropping things_etc. The worst symptom was feeling anxious_ and not being able to really catch my breath.  I am not normally an anxious person_ nor one who writes reviews_ but just wanted others to be aware. I felt slightly better after 2 hours_ and able to breathe a little easier_ but I still feel tired and slightly uncoordinated today 17 hours into it.,I have been giving this to my five year old for a while now. I hope he doesn't feel like I did! I usually only give him half a dose(1/4 tsp or 1.25 mg). It does work well against his allergies_ but I will definitely be more cautious now! I didn't know anything about the emotional aspects until finding this site_ so I will watch for those. As far as I am concerned_ I will never take a full dose again. If I ever try it again_ it will be at half the recommended dosage. Even at that_ I don't know if I will ever dare try it again. It was a pretty strong reaction!

168, 1, Allergies,Anxiety_ depression_ rage_ dark thoughts_ insecurity,I which I could give a negative rating for ZYRTEC.  Zyrtec turned my daughter into a different child. Over the past three months she has changed from a typical 11 year old (with occasional drama but always good natured_ kind and reasonable) into a girl that has intense irrational meltdowns several times a day.  I am very sad to say that we initial brushed her behavior off as typical preteen drama but the intensity of her outburst made me believe that something else was going on with her. I finally made the connection this morning and began researching the side effects. I called my child's doctor and sadly they have never heard of any side effects like this from Zyrtec - wow- so scary!I encourage anyone who has had side-effects to log them here.  I usually do not do this_ but I am so scared for the kids that are taking this drug.  If parents do not make the link between ZYRTEC and behavior these children could easily and unnecessarily get diagnosed with a mental health condition. ,F,11,3  months 1X D,5/31/2013,Zyrtec

I find it hard to believe that only 2% of Zyrtec users are affected by weight gain.  Seems like a tons of complaints about it.  I've always been a 3 meals a day person but since I started taking this I'm hungry all the time and my stomach is growling between meals. I take it around 8:00 at night so that I can sleep off the drowsy side affects_ but they still linger through the next day.  I've also encountered some waves of nausea 7-8 hours after taking it (and yes I take it with food).

I am extremely sensitive to medication of any kind.  One benedryl will knock me out for a day.  Everyone is different.  My husband takes zyrtec with no side effects.  My advice if you are someone who struggles with anxiety or tends to be very sensitive to medication_ do not take this.  I have been off of it for a few days and feel back to myself again.

About 1 and a half weeks after taking this medication_ I noticed I started to develop anxiety towards going to work and even anxiety about having an anxiety problem (if that makes sense).  It has progressively gotten worse as the blood level has increased. I find myself not looking forward to anything in life. My anxiety is very labile and goes from being very anxious to calm within a matter of seconds. I find myself only eating a few pieces of toast for breakfast and nothing else until dinner. I am a RN and I find this a crime that these severe side effects are not explained more blatantly.

I have tried Claritin and Allegra in the past before coming across Zyrtec. However they do not relieve my allergy symptoms anywhere near to what the Zyrtec does. I am a 38 year old female and I have no children. I have always been pretty active in exercise and a very very happy go lucky girl. The somewhat tragic side effects this medication has caused me has literally changed my life. What sucks is I didn't realize it was the Zyrtec until these last few days. I have put on well over 20 pounds that I tell you is IMPOSSIBLE to get off. I have been basically starving myself on a thousand calorie a day diet and wondering why I keep putting on weight. Or at least not losing one single ounce no matter what I do. My depression level is the greatest its ever been. I have suicidal thoughts. I also have little to no motivation. Thee other lovely_ oh so lovely side effect that is past the point of unbearable is the hair loss. It comes out in clumps when I wash it. It is so very disheartening. Id rather have itchy skin and watery eyes than FAT_ BALD & DEPRESSED!! I stopped Zyrtec this morning. NEVER AGAIN!!!,F,38,8  months 1X D,11/19/2012Email,Zyrtec

Tingly feeling in hands and feet_ numbness and soreness in back_ aches and flu like symptoms.,I first started taking this drug to relieve summer allergies to pollen and dust. I would have a itchy throat_ tight chest_ stuffy nose_ and a persistant cough due to post nasal drip. At first this drug was wonderful. It helped relieve the tight chest and helped with the cough. But eventually I noticed I had a very dry mouth and nose and even had a little trouble swallowing at night. I also was depressed and had feelings of hopelessness. I read about other side effects that people were experiencing with this drug and tried to start lowering my intake to 10mg one night_ 5mg the next for a few nights but because of handling some hay for the horses_ I ended back on 10mg a night. Then I switched to 5mg a night for a week and am having nasty aches_ pain in my chest and arm_ and panic attacks. I even have a migraine. I thought I had some weird disease or a heart attack_ feels like there's pressure inside. I went to the Dr and had an EKG. It was normal. My blood pressure was up some though. The Dr said I was depressed and gave me some antidepressants which I did not take. After reading all this other comments_ I am so happy to find out that what I am feeling is not totally strange. I am doing my best to stop Zyrtec completely and can't wait until I don't take it at all!,F,23,7  months10 MG 1X D,11/1/2012,Zyrtec

211, 3, corn pollen / working in field,I've been OK in the past taking zyrtec--drowsiness and feeling stoned shortly after starting.  But this time_ pollination season has gone on longer_ and I'm getting side effects that last even on days when I'm not in the field_ and not taking the drug.  The headache in my temples is the worst_ and now repeatedly recurs as the drug wears off. Also histamine-like symptoms (stuffiness_ sore throat) which I assume is just a rebound effect. I feel like my salivary glands are also confused / sore--again_ probably a rebound effect.  When I try to take a full dose (10 mg pill) I might as well be a zombie for a few hours afterwards.,"That said_ zyrtec is the ONLY allergy med I have found that works in extreme conditions.  So long as I have to (basically) keep dumping corn pollen all over my face and body_ I will continue to take zyrtec. I also take a couple when traveling in case of emergency_ for similarly extreme circumstances. I would recommend this pill only for short-term use_ and not more than half a pill every 12-18 hours (adult dose). In fact_ I can feel the half pill wearing off at around 17-18 hours. When I start to itch_ I take another half quickly_ before I start to wheeze_ snot up_ get swollen eyelids. It is very effective_ but IMHO_ not really appropriate for long-term use_ nor for ""convenience"" use. If you can deal with the situation by removing the allergen (or removing yourself to an allergen-free space) or by taking something weaker_ do that. I wish they made a 5 mg version that I could split into two 2.5 mg doses (which might also be more appropriate for pediatric use).  The take home: meds are not candy. They do things to your body. Treat them with respect_ and don't use them unless you really HAVE to. In contrast_ some other allergy meds score barely above placebo as far as effectiveness.  They have fewer side effects--but they empty your wallet_ and don't do much for your allergies.",F,46,15  times5 mg 2X D,8/23/2012Email,Zyrtec

I also use it for a few days in a row if I have an acute pollen allergy attack. If you are so miserable from your allergies that you are tired and depressed_ it is worth it to feel better physically and then the mild to moderate side effects (if that's all you have) are worth it.

His allergies would lead to recurring sinus infections.   While it seemed to help with itching and hives_ it didn't help very much with the allergy/sinus symptoms. I would usually give the zyrtec to him as needed but the pediatrician said to start giving it to him daily.  As soon as he was taking it daily_ I started noticing changes in him such as irritabilty_ crying over little things all the time_ huge increase in separation anxiety_ being scared of noises and darkness_ and depression.

Now_ three years later_ I'm down to one-quarter of a tablet once a day. It has taken that long to almost get my system rebalanced! I hope I can get off this drug completely.

I even slightly increased the dosage this wk (per her doctor's orders) and split it so she took some in the AM and some in the PM but she still was complaining about not feeling well.  This wk she has been very emotional over minor things and started to complain about her stomach hurting. Then_ she said_ ""I am mad but don't know why.""

Last night_ after being off of Zyrtec for almost 24 hrs_ she said she didn't feel well & she didn't know why_ thought her heart was racing & asked if she could go to the doctor in the AM.  That was it.  We immediately went to the ER of the local children's hospital where she had an EKG that was normal.  The doctor there said he sees this problem all the time with antihistamines in children.  He stated that some children just go off the wall crazy with them & that it would take a few days for her to return to normal & that if she wasn't better by then to see her dr.  That night was horrible & it was almost midnight before she could calm down enough to sleep.  Her clothes were bothering her & she was worried about everything.

Last year I started taking Allegra D_ and that worked fantastically so this year I thought I might start Zyrtec again because it's cheaper for the most part and easier to swallow without water (when i forget and have to stuff one in my pocket to take on the go). I bought Zyrtec about a month and a half ago since the weather warmed up realllyyyyyy early this year and started taking it.

As with most recently approved non-prescription products_ Zyrtec is usually safe to use and rarely causes serious side effects. These serious side effects include but are not limited to: Wheezing or other breathing problemsDifficulty passing urineHigh blood pressure (hypertension)A rapid heart rate (tachycardia) or a feeling of a rapidly or forcefully beating heart (known as heart palpitations)ConfusionAnxietyAn increase in liver enzymesSigns of an allergic reaction_ such as: An unexplained rashHivesItchingUnexplained swelling_ especially of the lips_ mouth_ or throat. Less Common Zyrtec Side EffectsRare Zyrtec side effects occur in less than 2 percent of people taking the drug.

We thought it was a behavior issue_ and even took him to see a therapist for a few sessions.After my daughter (3 yrs.) had a VERY bad reaction to Zyrtec (night terrors)_ we took my son off of it completely_ thinking maybe it would help with his bedwetting_ which it did.Unfortunately_ a year later_ my son's allergies were so bad that I_ without remembering what I had read online_ started him back on Zyrtec for his really bad allergies.  I was truly just looking for some relief for him.  Within a week_ he was so violent towards his sister for no reason.  He had uncontrollable rage_ he told me he was stupid and he wished he was dead.  Even his handwriting was illegible during this time!  He was able to ""control"" his symptoms at school_ but as soon as he got in the car to come home_ the frustration and rage would start.  He also experienced severe anxiety about things as simple as going to a new park or going to his basketball games.  It took me 5 horrible weeks to put it together this time.

281, 1, Hayfever_ sinus allergies,"My daughter (age 4 when she started Zyrtec_ now age 6) over time has been exhibiting increasing anxiety and nervousness.  She always says she has ""bad thoughts.""  She has lots of fears.  Cries because she does not want to go to school_ constantly checks her pulse to make sure her heart is still beating_ expresses fears that she'll stop breathing in her sleep.  We took her to a counselor and in the first few minutes of our initial visit she informed us that Zyrtec can be a cause for anxiety and depression.  We were shocked!",We have stopped her Zyrtec now and are hoping that her anxiety will begin to get better.  It breaks my heart to see my baby like she is.

Do doctors get kickbacks_ or are they just arrogant?

We thought she was going crazy and I cried at the loss of my sweet child_ but then sat up in bed in the midst of this and realized the only thing different in our lives was the fact that she had started taking this med.

284, 1, Allergies,Extreme abdominal pain & constipation_ urination problems_ heart palpitations_ anxiety_ depression_ cold/numb hands and feet_ red/irritated/puffy eyes_ insomnia_ anger/rage and mood swings.,Allergies are a problem for me in the spring & late fall in Oklahoma.  I felt great this summer and when October came the allergies hit like clockwork.  The first few weeks went by seemingly uneventful and about the last of Oct I noticed I had no zest for life anymore.  Anxiety and depression had set in on me and I was not even aware of it.  I did not want to go anywhere_ do anything or be around people.  I am restoring an old car and up until late October this was my passion and I had no desire at all to continue working on my car.  I also noticed that I hurt all over my body...muscle pain_ joint pain_ cold hands and feet.  I also noticed that I would snap at my wife and kids for the smallest things and at the time I felt this was warranted.  Rage was a problem as well.    I had difficulty urinating and would spend what seemed like an hour for a process that usually takes 10-15 seconds.  While zyrtec did control some very bad allergy symptoms for me I have decided that the allergy problems are nowhere near as bad as the side effects caused by zyrtec. As I look back over the last 2 years of my life I can clearly see the problems I had and were all due to zyrtec.  I'll never take this med again.,M,48,2  years10mg 1X D,1/6/2012Email,Zyrtec
285, 1, common allergies: dust_ pollen_ etc,It relieved my runny nose_ sneezing_ and itchy eyes all of my life. When I would miss a dose I would feel itchy all over and we believed it was just my allergies surfacing so I would take my medicine and feel better. I was at a 5mg dose for the first few years and then bumped it up to 10mg.  Once_ when I was about 14_ I was on vacation for a few days and realized I forgot my medicine at home but figured it shouldn't be the end of the world and that I would be home soon enough. Instead_ after a few days without zyrtec_ I woke up in the middle of the night with a terrible headache and nausea. Of course these withdrawal syptoms were on top of the unbearable itching that feel like bugs under my skin accompanied with scratching that leads to my dermatographism making my body one giant welt. Anyway_ I took some tylenol for the headache and bought some zyrtec the next morning and felt fine. I officially started my final withdrawal a week ago and if my nose is runny I take a claritin. There is nothing that will surpress the itching which is the worst part. I have found that the key to making it so long is resisting the urge to scratch. Once you start scratching its all over. Previously_ 3 days has been my longest time without giving in. Staying active and busy helps take your mind off the scratching and benadryl is a good way to knock yourself out when its unbearable. And if you start itching_ rub an ice cube on the area or take an ice bath or cold shower. Good luck to everyone like,,F,19,10  years10 mg,1/2/2012,Zyrtec

Zyrtec works much better on my allergies than Allegra ever did_ but this improvement has come with some unpleasant side-effects. Most notably I feel like I'm in a ""brain fog"" much of the time_ often feel lethargic and disinterested as well. This in turn makes me kinda crabby_ which is not my usual style.Friends_ family_ and coworkers are always asking why I look so tired and I sheepishly explain that it's my new allergy meds - hopefully they don't think I'm trying to explain away a drug problem of some kind. My dad's a PA and says my body should adjust eventually to minimize the side-effects_ but there's also a chance it won't... we'll see.All I know is that it's great to be able to be around my own dog without feeling like someone threw sand in my eyes and throat - that alone makes it worth the ""price of admission.""

When I finally went online there are thousands and thousands of blogs by people saying the same thing. They say they can't get off it and many resume due to the extreme discomfort.  Some say it takes weeks or months to withdraw. But only 4 days in and going absolutely nuts I can say that the bloating has stopped..the aches are gone!!!

I very rarely get itchy_ and if I do_ scratching only results in redness and not hives.  However_ I recently decided to try to come off of zyrtec to see if diet changes (removing gluten and dairy for a few weeks) would help the dermatographism.  I have trouble believing that taking a drug for so long can be good for you.  Anyways_ so far (after only 3 days!)_ I have a ton more energy especially in the mornings_ but my skin is borderline unbearable.  I'm a little worried I won't be able to tell between itching from my actual dermatographism and any possible withdrawal symptoms from the zyrtec.  The next few weeks should be interesting_ but I'm determined to stay off this stuff!

Irritable_ mood swings_ and general malaise.,I started taking Zyrtec (begrudingly_ as I hate taking ANY medication) to control cat allergies. Only take it when symptoms begin to show which is about 1/2 pill 2-3 times or less per week. About 2 months ago I began having sporadic asthma attacks_ usually at night_ lasting for anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours and occasionally wake up in the morning with asthma symptoms persisting.

Thought it was just my work_ the kids and getting older_ etc. Lately_ my nose was getting SO dried out_ that it was painful to touch and constantly filled with crusty stuff_ like scabs from little cuts.  So_ I went off Zyrtec.,Since getting off Zyrtec (cold turkey)_ after less than 1 week my nose is healing_ but OMG the face itchiness!!!  I never thought I'd have withdrawal symptoms!  Having never experienced them before_ I was really worried - my face is numb and tingling and I can't seem to stay still (restless).  Now I know!  Coming across this website is a lifesaver (I thought I was going crazy!).  I am just waiting for all the side effects to eventually subside before I try something else.

325, 1, asthma,Runny nose_ bloating in the face_ depression_ nightmares,I had taken zyretec last year for 4 months after i had a horrible asthma attack. within those 4 months_ were the worst times of my life_ I felt very depressed_ and at one point had thoughts of suicide_ im 15 years- and am still growing in height and noticed that my natural speed of growth had stopped dramatically_ (i was 14 at the time when i was taking it). Any time i took the medicine i would wake up with a bloated face- even my friends in school noticed the change in my face (my self esteem lowered big time). My nose was constantly runny- and i had huge exams- so the outcome_ as you can see_ didnt go so well_ yes_ it helped my breathing_ but id rather not go through those 4 months again. I also do recall having some terrible dreams. I dont recomendend this medication for anyone below the age 18_ atleast it is what i think_ since i am younger i had a higher risk of many side effects. Now that i have stopped using it_ and switched back to singular_ my face went back to normal_ my nose isnt runny_ my height hasnt changed- it takes a while for your natural growth to take back its place in order( by the way my parents are very tall- my mom is 5'7 my dad 6'0_ i dont believe it is a gene thing) _ and the bad dreams i was having no longer exist.,F,15,4  monthsIDK 2X D,7/13/2011Email,Zyrtec
326, 4, Seasonal allergy to grass,Sleepiness_ puffy below the eyes_ but does help my allergies.,It was very helpful to read a lot of the comments. I've only been using Zyrtec one day_ and have had a few of the side effects_ but don't want to give up on it just yet as it has help immensely with my allergies.  During this time of year_ when the sun is finally out in Oregon_ I would have been banished to the inside of my house.  Was actually able to take a couple of wonderful hikes with my husband in the last couple of days without any sneezing_ watery_ itchy eyes or runny nose.  From all I have read sounds like taking a smaller dose_ not staying on it too long_ and weaning yourself off gradually seems to be the best course of action_ if you are not willing to give up on it.  I'll cut back to 5 mg per day at 8pm each night and see what happens.  Wish me luck :),F,49,1  days10 1X D,7/2/2011Email,Zyrtec
327, 1, Allergies and Asthma,Didn't notice any side effects when I was on it except a constant stuffy nose_ worse asthma but I am unsure that is because of the ZYRTEC.  I am experiencing bad withdrawals right now.  This is my second time trying to come off of it_ using Clariton as a supplement to try to get off of it.  This is my third day and I am very_ very dizzy and extremely nauseous.  I am praying that I do not vomit.  I do not want to take it any longer so I hope it goes away.  The first time I tried to get off of it I was so itchy I could not work or sleep.  The clariton has helped with that_ but I want to get off of that also.  I have successfully withdrawaled off of effexor_ advair and singular and it took me 1 year.  I never thought Zyrtec would have such bad withdrawals since it was an OTC allergy medicine...

I spoke to my mother about it_ and she said that when she tried taking Zyrtec_ she experienced muscle spasms in her legs! That sounded a bit too scary to me_ so I quit taking it right away. I've been off it for two days now_ and the rash is almost cleared_ and my mood and energy levels are back to normal.

331, 1, allergies to a laundry soap I think,chronic fatigue_ irritability_ anger_ depression_ weight gain_ itching_ dizzyness,"I started taking it when I began having horrible allergies (turned out to be from a powder laundry soap). While taking Zyrtec I felt very lethargic_ depressed_ irritable_ easily frustrated_ I had no energy or strength. I had the allergy for weeks before I took zyrtec and did not have the symptoms that I ended up having while on the Zyrtec so I know they didn't result from the allergy. I am normally a thin person and I gained 9 pounds in the two months I was taking Zyrtec. I am normally a very patient_ loving_ thoughtful parent. I am a happy_ easy-going_ and very motivated person. While on Zyrtec I was very irritated and unhappy with my family. I didn't realize that these symptoms were due to Zyrtec at the time. My allergy went away and I didn't take zyrtec anymore. My energy was back_ I started my P90X exercize again and lost four pounds. I felt like my old self again and was a happy mom and wife again. Then a few days ago I cleaned that shelf where the laundry soap had been and my allergy came back. I started the zyrtec four days ago. Again_ I have no energy. I have not excersized at all_ I'm hungrier_ I am so irritable even the sound of my husband chewing food makes me angry. I feel overwhelmed when the baby cries. I kept shaking my head today saying_ ""there is something wrong.""  I decided to look up the side effects of zyrtec. That's the only thing I am taking.

He takes one tablet with breakfast and also takes two puffs QVAR (steroid inhaler).

He has horrible angry outburst_ hard to get him up for school_ will say he hates himself and that he's stupid. Has a hard time focusing in school. His teacher and I assumed he is exhibiting ADD symptoms. I even researched ADD diets and was loosly treating him as if he had ADD. I do notice he scratches a lot - but he also has eczema. I will definatley start weaning him off. He will need another medication to control all his allergies though. He's been on Nasonex and some other med when he was little(about 3yrs old) that gave him night terrors and sleep walking.

349, 3, Seasonal Allergies,Stabbing headaches_ drowsiness_ stiffness in upper back and unable to get a good sleep.,I've been using Claritin for the past few years and decided to try Zyrtec for the first time this season.   I don't like to take any meds unless I absolutely have to.  It took a few hours for the meds to start working.  It made me drowsy which is not unusual when you take any medications.  For me it's always good to take the medication_ wait and rest for it to start working.   It worked okay for the most part_ my nose stopped running and I stopped sneezing.   One of the side effects is that I wake up with a dry nose and it's just a tad stuffed_ but goes away.   I took one pill on Saturday afternoon_ by Sunday afternoon the medication should have started to wane_ and I wasn't planning on taking another one. The side effect was that  I started getting stabbing headaches that lasted for almost 24 hours.  I'm not sure if it was the Zyrtec.  So on Wednesday my allergies came back and I took another pill that afternoon.  After 24 hours again_ the next day_ I started getting the stabbing headaches.   Coincidence or side effect?  I'm not sure if I want to tempt fate again_ but I think....maybe I do it one more time_  just to be sure.

So I did and when I got back home I gave them to her and she took one right away. I made the family some breakfast_ set the table and served everyone. We were having a nice conversation with our daughter and everything was fine and we finish breakfast. My wife asks me to get the laptop to figure out where we should live since we're moving soon and so I bring it over to the table. After setting it down I say ""well let me put the dishes away real quick first."" She frigging flips out saying I'm obviously just trying to establish my dominance by ignoring her and doing whatever I want. She proceeds the flipping out and throws my clothes on the ground and yells at me to get out and she's had enough of me and a couple other expletives. I'm a little disturbed but I know my wife and she isn't like this. I decide to leave and let things calm down. Thank god I made the connection right away and found this website.

376, 1, allergies,Mood disturbance_ severe withdrawal symptoms,My 9-year old son started taking Zyrtec in the fall for seasonal allergies. He also has food allergies and has taken Zyrtec on occasion_ but never for an extended period before. After two months_ we tried to stop_ but he developed the itching many other posters have complained about. Our pediatrician told me not to read blogs and to keep him on 10mg/day and to see the allergist. The allergist's nurse said we could not come in unless he'd been off the Zyrtec for 5 days_ but he could not stop the Zyrtec without the itching - a vicious cycle. Finally_ after reading more online_ I insisted on talking to the allergist_ who got on the phone and confirmed that the itching is a withdrawal symptom. Basically_ he said_ your body gets used to the histamines being suppressed; when they flood back_ some peoples' bodies overreact. He said prednizone would help and that the itching would go over in 2-5 days_ but I didn't want to give my son steroids_ and the itching persisted and was unbearable. I switched him to Benadryl (shorter-acting) and followed a step-down approach. A week at 3/4 of a 25 mg pill at bedtime; then a week at 1/2 a pill; then a week at 1/4; then a week at 1/8 (After cutting the 25 mg pink pills in half_ I bought the children's 12.5 mg fast melt tablets and cut those in half_ then in quarters). My son has now been off all antihistamines for 4 days and is still slightly itchy from time to time_ but I think we're over the worst.

HOWEVER_ by the 4th day a dark sad mood came over me - for no apparent reason. (I am a 44 year old woman that understands her body well - when I am hormonal_ etc. This was not hormones.) By the 5th day_ I was feeling suicidal and extremely concerned by the depression closing in on me. I was also very very tired_ even though I had slept 8 hours the night before.,Then_ I remembered that we had taken my 9 year old son off of Zyrtec because we thought it was affecting his moods. Apparently_ we were right... his out look on life and his general mood changed drastically a couple of days after taking him off Zyrtec.

The hives cleared up for the most part and I started wondering about the long term use of zytrec and looked it up on the internet - I decided to stop it cold turkey and recalled how I thought my allergies were getting worse in the fall of 2010 as if I went off the zytrec for a few days I would start feeling awful and once I started it again I felt better. However the hives on my hands started up while I was still taking zytrec. So I went cold turkey off it_ I am currently on day 21 off this nasty drug.

383, 1, Allergies,Heed my words: STAY AWAY FROM ZYRTEC! I discovered Zyrtec in May_ 2010. Totally cleared up my allergies and I was sold. I used it off and on_ whenever I had bad days.  I started using it more consistently every other day in mid December.  I also started to get dizzy when I tried to sleep on my sides - or try to sleep in general. What made this worse is it was making me extremely tired.  Thought it might be BPPV or something more catastrophic. Went to the dr. and he prescribed me Trazodone - said the feelings must be sleep related. Didn't take them as I could tell he didn't quite know what it was and Trazodone's top side effect was dizziness.,Stopped a week ago after exhausting searches on the internet about anything related to dizziness. Zyrtec and this site finally popped up. I also learned through further reading it is an ototoxic medicine (great to know now since I'm a MUSICIAN/COMPOSER)_ quit and after about 4 days started to feel like myself again.

The first day was okay_ but I did not notice any side effects.  The second day_ I had a strange dream where my father came on to me sexually.  I have never been abused or molested ever in my life_ so there was no reason to have such a nightmare.

I was also screaming my husband's name in the dream_ but he couldn't hear me because the bathroom fan was on.  I woke up in tears_ relieved it was a nightmare_ but still very disturbed.

I started my research today on the itching and realized_ like so many others_ that it isn't just me.  My doctor told me the itching must be from an allergy to something in my house.  Not so - it is definitely withdrawal from the Zyrtec.  I am going to cut back to half a pill every three days and buy Claritin to help minimize the itching.  After a week or two of half pill doses_ I will try to stop completely.  I'm determined to do this quickly.  The sooner_ the better.

I began to suspect the change of medication and after about three weeks decided to quit taking the pills to see if they were causing the trouble. Sure enough within a day or two I was feeling back to normal. I did have some itching_ mostly at night_ but nothing as severe as described by others_ maybe because I hadn't been taking it for very long. After five days off_ I tried to complete the test by taking one pill last night at bedtime and already today I have been so exhausted I could barely keep my eyes open all day.

I just found this site but I went through Hell getting off this drug back in 2009...before beginning this drug I used to be a very deadline driven ambitious person_ confident in myself and easy going. This drug completely changed me. I didnt notice that I had ""changed"" until those around me started saying I had gained alot of weight (30 extra pounds--the heaviest I have ever been was 125 and I was almost 160 lbs on this med.) I started getting in to major arguments with my boyfriend to the point where I felt psychotic! Over the littlelest things_ crying spells_ sitting in a room thinking about life is not worth living_ thinking of the worst in everything---that there was no bright side. I felt so depressed. All my problems in my life where intensified with this drug. These side effects began about 6 months of starting the drug. Thats when the major a",continued...I was late on my assignments and at work I was also falling behind to the point I was gonna get written up! totally not my personality. The sad thing I didnt even care. I just wanted to go home and sleep all day. I never went anywhere...I was a zombie. I found your website and immediately stopped taking this drug. I used Aveeno to bathe and lotion myself down with to stop the itching. I could shave my armpits for a while though because i broke out in a rash a month after stopping the med. I was able to shave after a few months after that. I drank tea for my throat and just endured the seasonal allergies. Every time I itched I just put lotion on. I very well weaned off this horrible drug a year later. I have lost so much weight --especiallyy around my stomach area! I am now 140 something getting close to 130 lbs and hopefully back to my original weight in a few more months. I am trying to go back to school and I am doing way better at work--I can concentrate now. I dont sit at home sleeping my life away. I get out and socialize now and am more active. This drug made me anti-social. I just wanted to say that you can wean off this. I dont take anything for my allergies anymore. I just dont trust the side effects and its not worth my life.

I have tried going off Zyrtec before during the winter months but always have the itching that gets worse with each day I'm without Zyrtec so I usually start it again. But after reading all these testimonials_ I am going off it for good. It's been 4 days since I took Zyrtec and I am feeling flu symptoms. I just feel really weird and have a sore throat.  I don't know if this is from not having the Zyrtec or if I really do have flu symptoms (I haven't felt right for 2-3 days) and its not getting any better.

An hour later_ after sending my son off to school_ went for a nap and woke up 6 hours later from an upsetting dream. I was sluggish throughout the afternoon and early evening. Finally went to bed and shortly afterward began having night terrors for the first time in my life! I couldn't breath_ felt paralized and had to lay there until I calmed down. Will not recommend this to anyone especially children.

I do get dizzy_ irritable and have heart palps and I'm not sure if Zyrtec is contributing to this.  It might just be anxiety.  I can't take more that 1/2 tablet or it will make me very sleepy.  It's not a fast acting antihistamine so if you need something fast you might try chlortab or benadryl.  I take the zyrtec as a last resort if I can't get the darn sneezing to stop or if my eyes start itching.  It has strong sedative qualities so take before bed time.,F,41,4  years10 mg 1X D,11/3/2010,Zyrtec
410, 4, Allergies and Asthma,None that I have noticed_ although I do take it just before I go to bed_ so I'm really unable to tell if it may cause any drowsiness.,I have moderate allergies year round_ but I am severely allergic to cats. I have recently moved into a house with three cats. For awhile I was taking other allergy pills that were working okay_but I had to take them more frequently_ and I was still suffering a lot of symptoms. When I began to take Zyrtec 24 hour_ Nearly every one of my symptoms were reduced greatly. Before_ living with cats was nearly unbearable_ with the itching_ sneezing_ watery eyes_ inability to breathe_ etc. Now_ I can even play with the cats and I feel fine. Just a little bit of itching still occurs_ and my nose isn't always perfectly clear. One day I went just over my 24 hour limit to see what would happen_ and my allergic reactions came back with a vengence_ so this medicine might have to be a full time thing for me_ but it's better than my other options.,F,18,50  days10 mg 1X D,11/1/2010,Zyrtec

I think it helped the allergies_ but I have been so tired_ I can barely function. Like some others_ I am so glad I found this website because my doctor did not tell me/think it could be this medicine.  But based on when the symptoms started_ I know that this is the culprit because I am usually a very energetic person.  Didn't have the negative emotions_ but who knows_ maybe I would have had I continued.  Thanks for posting everyone.

412, 1, Moderate seasonal allergies,Heart palpitations_ dizziness_ itching when I stopped taking it.,I only started getting allergies about 4 years ago. Most of the time the symptoms are pretty mild. My doctor recommended Zyrtec and I would take it for 2-3 days at a time when my symptoms were intolerable. 5 weeks ago I started having bad dizzy spells and hives and my doctor diagnosed allergies and said that since I was so out of it I needed to take the Zyrtec until they cleared up. The dizzy spells went away after about a week. I would take the drug for several days and then skip a day to see if the allergies had gone away yet. Every time_ I started itching again_ so I thought the allergen was still around and went back on the drug. Several days ago_ the dizzy spells came back along with a pounding heart that would last for hours. I'm very fit and physically active so this seemed really weird. Went back to my doctor who told me that palpitations and dizziness could both be side effects of Zyrtec and gave me a new prescription. I didn't even try the new prescription but my dizzy spells are gone already so I assume this bout of allergies is over. My heart rate is also getting closer to normal. I do still have a little itching_ but looking at what everyone else has to say_ I'm now convinced that this is due to stopping the Zyrtec and not to an allergy.,F,38,5  weeks10 1X D,10/28/2010,Zyrtec
413, 4, Allergy induced asthma,I am pregnant so it is hard to know_ I have been tired but it could just be pregnancy.,I had a cold in June that I could not get over.  I had an extreme cough that kept me up all night.  Around this time I also became pregnant.  Doc. gave me prednisone 1wk and I felt better and also an albuterol inhaler telling me I suddenly had asthma.  I was okay for a month but the cough never really left. I still coughed a lot during the day and often needed albuterol before bed (although it made me jittery). I started needing the inhaler 3 times a day.  He prescribed prednisone for 1wk and daily use of Flovent Diskus. I was feeling pretty good and did not need albuterol.  After 2wk sample ran out I went to pharmacy and found it was $96/mo. after insurance.  I looked up alternatives and found it was category C risk during pregnancy (more experimental than most drugs).  Went to my OBGYN and he suggested Zyrtec (only cat. B).  I have been on it almost a month and have only used my albuterol once (when I had taken my dose late).  I do get a little congestion in the morning which is normal for me and common for pregnant women.  I have a productive cough and it is gone before I'm up and about for the day.  I am sleeping much better at night and am overall much better off_ although Flovent worked too_ I feel better about the lower risk.,F,28,1  months10mgy 1X D,10/19/2010Email,Zyrtec

After reading comments here_ I'm taking him off.",As an aside_ I had chronic idiopathic urticaria when I was younger (still comes back every now and then). To keep it under control_ I took a combo of Tagamet (yes_ the stomach acid medicine) and Claritin.

420, 1, ragweed allergies,Pediatrician recommended to give our 3 year old son for his allergies.  Finally_ he slept through the night without coughing fits and congestion.  However_ this medication took my sweet-natured boy and turned him in to something unrecognizeable.  Very naughty behavior_ total defiance_ hitting_ throwing_ lack of appetite_ infrequent urination...  Within 3 days of his first dose I realized what the cause of his behavioral changes were and immediately removed him from this medicine (and tossed the remainder in the trash).  Very shortly thereafter he was once again my loving son.  I sure hope that the makers of this drug read these observations and determine a fix.  It's a real shame when something that is supposed to help you can change you in to something completely unrecognizeable.ps: called the pedicatrician's office and they were aware of the possible reactions and noted in his file that my son can not have this medication.,,F,3,3  days1 tsp 1X D,10/5/2010,Zyrtec

427, 1, severe allergies,anger_ suicidal thoughts_ severe weight gain_ depression_ insatiable hunger_ feelings of hopelessness_ lack of motivation,There is a woman who commented that there seems to be a 'made up' symptoms and side effects because she has never personally had any. That is ridiculous. Your skepticism doesn't help anyone. For years I have wondered why I continued to gain weight even though I lowered my caloric intake and increased activity. I've never had trouble losing weight in the past. I started taking it in Korea where we were stationed in the military. The allergies were awful. Both my son and I had the same symptoms. Both of us were angry_ hungry_ irritable and depressed. When we left Korea we stopped taking it and got better. We are in South Texas now and both of us started taking it agin--even though we are in a happy situation_ we became depressed_ angry_ suicidal and had increased hunger and weight gain again. I am happy to have found this website because after I did_ I got off zyrtec and I am my happy_ healthy self again. I'm losing weight and my son is more stable emotionally. Please do not criticize other people's reactions. Just because you don't have them doesn't mean they don't exist.

Over a few weeks the symptoms improved somewhat_ until we missed one morning dose and we were right back to square one with the significant behavior issues.  She also has lost two pounds this month due to lack of appetite.  We were trying to keep her on it until the fall allergies abated_ but this cannot go on any longer. We have put her back on Claritin and will give her benadryl at night if needed to control the symptoms.  After two days we are starting to see our sweet angel again.

There are many over the counter meds for children but I wouldn't give my child it without an ok from the Dr.I love Zyrtec. I have major allergies and have tried everything. Over the counter_ rx from Dr and nothing helped. Then one day a Allergy Dr gave me a sample of Zyrtec. It was new on the market. I loved it! Won't take any thing else. and when they can out with their eye drops I was in love all over again. Again before Zyrtec eye drops I tried all the rx drops_ all the over the counter eye drops and my eyes still itched. My eyes itched so bad I have scars on my eye lids from rubbing them. One drop of Zyrtec eye drops and the itch was gone. I found heaven all thanks to Zyrtec. Thanks Zyrtec_ your #1 in my book.,F,53,10  years10 mg 1X D,9/13/2010,Zyrtec

We made an appointment with a psyc doc. It was not until several days later I realized the only change was that I had started giving him allergy medicine.  Who whould have thought allergy medicine could do this.  He stopped taking it and is completely normal without behavior issues.  Could not believe it.,I am so sorry that I gave this medicine to my child.  I will never ever recommend anyone give this medicine to children.

She is 6 years old and will throw fits and scream and cry like a baby. She has a hard time concentrating and in kindergarten last year_ her teacher was worried she may have autism. We have been to a neurologist over her headaches. I had no idea about all of this and am so thankful for this website. Me and my neighbor were talking the other day and she had said that she had given her daughter zyrtec one time and it totally changed her and it made me think. So my daughter hasn't had any zyrtec in 5 days and yesterday her teacher called me to tell what a good day she had in school. I was amazed.

436, 1, Seasonal allergies,My two year old son_ who has always been sweet_ loving and agreeable started taking Zyrtec for seasonal allergies and his entire mood_ demeanor and attitude completely changed. He started acting like a different child. He became angry_ violent_ didn't want to eat_ irritable_ weepy and clingy. He would wake up screaming NO at night_ when he never had sleeping issues before. He would smash his head on things_ hit himself_ pull out his hair and crush food and throw it everywhere when he was frustrated_ sad or scared. The only thing we can attribute these changes to is the Zyrtec. All these symptoms started when he started the medicine. I have stopped giving it to him after reading this website because I now know I am not crazy!

Zyrtec has changed my life.  Not only have I gotten rid of a daily intense ear itch (apparently from unknown allergies)_ but I also developed more severe allergies last year_ and taking Zyrtec-D has rid me of the symptoms.  Also_ I have noticed that when getting a cold_ Zyrtec helps immensely and I can function normally.  It does make me very tired_ which is why I take it at bedtime_ and I wake up just fine and my allergies stay away all day.  Usually I just take 1/2 pill (over the counter).  If you have any of these problems_ PLEASE try this drug.  It really works.  You can find ways to get around the drowsiness and hunger pretty easily.  Take at bedtime and eat healthy!  Side effects will occur with any medication.  These are very manageable and SO much better than allergies!!!,F,29,8  months10 1X D,8/20/2010,Zyrtec

Also_ extreme histamine rebound if I stop taking suddenly_ after taking it regularly for a prolonged period. However...,...through much trial and error over the years_ I have learned to avoid or minimize these effects. First_ 10mg is too high of a dose for me. I tend to cut the pill into quarters and take one quarter every other day_ while necessary. Plus all of the obvious things: drink water more frequently_ eat a simple balanced diet_ get adequate sleep. Addition_ I use a neti pot at least once a day. Mild_ sweet candy helps with the dry throat. And I have found that the best time to take the Zyrtec dose is around lunchtime. When it's time to stop_ I'll taper off by extending the interval to two days_ then three_ etc._ while also reducing the dosage.

The next morning_ after just 4 hours of sleep_ I sprang out of bed and felt much happier than I had the night before.

I have other health issues which have been reported as side effects of Z_ but I have not gone off Z long enough to find out if those will be relieved as well.

I started to suspect that it my be Zyrtec since that is the only ""thing"" that has changed recently in my life.  I read about the side effects online and noticed the only thing I had in common was dry mouth in the morning which seemed normal as my nose was also dry!  My allergies were acting up again last night_ so I took a Zyrtec.  Once again_ I woke feeling extremely angry and very depressed!  After reading all the posts_ I realized this must be the problem.

We stopped the zyrtec last week when the discount mega-bottle we'd bought a few months ago ran out. Well_ suddenly_ we had our daughter back. She had become obnoxiously rude_ unable to focus or sit still for any real amount of time_ had difficulties getting to sleep_ had frequent temper tantrums_ argued incessantly_ and generally became nearly intolerable to be around--honestly_ I had thought about getting her a psych evaluation and entering into family therapy. Last night_ 4 days without zyrtec_ I found her quietly engaged in an art project_ listening to music.

It was an unbelievable improvement.  Only issue was next day drowsiness_ which I've nearly eliminated by taking 7.5 instead of 10 mg (tricky cutting the tablets though; and_ 5 mg was not quite enough) and doing so 2 hours before bed rather than right at bedtime.  Unexpected benefit was a reduction in some social anxiety I've had off and on for years_ which I believe is due to a residual anxiolytic effect of Zyrtec/cetirizine as an Atarax/hydroxyzine metabolite - can't find substantiation for this anywhere but I don't think it's my imagination!,M,50,14  days7.5 mg 1X D,7/28/2010,Zyrtec

I could tell that if I actually let myself fall asleep_ it would be the kind of deep sleep that goes on for hours but leaves you feeling groggy and disoriented upon waking.

I couldn't wear any kind of lipstick/chapstick with color or flavor because it gave me a sore throat and made the area around my mouth turn red.Zyrtec has not completely cured my night breathing problems_ but it has made them tons better. The biggest difference is that I am rarely itchy. it used to be that once I started scratching_ I couldn't stop and sometimes_ I would end up bleeding. I am so happy not to have to worry about that anymore. My skin still welts up if I scratch it_ but I hardly ever do. I also don't have to worry about wearing chapstick or lipstick.

I thought it was one of those non-drowsy drugs so the sleepy lethargic feelings were blamed on the fact that I thought I was getting older really quick.  I am usually a nice even tempered person and responded with rage to someone that I love for something that may have otherwise made me mad but not vengeful.  I also lectured a man in the grocery store yesterday because he took too long to pick out his lemons.  Oh my gosh -- who is this insane woman? After I snapped at a few other people today I tried to analyze what was going on with me.  I remembered that the Dr had given me zyrtec for my itchy skin a couple of weeks ago.  I decided to look at the side effects and irritability is not given as one of the most prevalent side effects listed by the drug company.

I took a second dose later in the week and slept for 14 hours_ had mild hallucinations_ and was in a walking dream-like state all day.  When I got home I got into another fight and threatened to knife someone I didn't agree with while making irrational arguments over absolutely nothing. I then became so depressed and suicidal that if I had had anything poisonous in the house I wouldn't be here right now - it was like it sucked all of the light and joy out of me and all that was left was emotional anguish.

Rather than go back to the Dermatologist and get a biopsy (which according to the doctor was the next step) I started investigation the side effects of the prescription medications that I was taking and started eliminating the ones that I didnt absolutely have to take and still no change in my skin irritation. Now I started eliminating the OTC medications that I take. I have been off of Zyrtec for about 4 days now and my skin is finally starting to clear up (YEA!!!).

I'll then be free of symptoms for a good 4-5 days. It'll come back_ but it won't be severe. On those days I do a saline nose spray and otherwise am able to live with it without suffering too much.

Glad it only took my 24hrs to figure this out instead of the 6 months_ year_ 2 years it took others on this site.  In addition_ I have all the other negative side effects listed_ increased appitite_ sleepy_ etc.  So it must be an all or nothing proposistion.  You either are fine with it and you have no side effects or you have all.  Suggestion_ buy the 5 pack - take one - if it works great.  However_ if you notice any of the negative side effects_ toss them out and move on.  It won't get any better_ it will only get worse.,M,42,2  days10 1X D,4/13/2010,Zyrtec

Since then she has had chronic nosebleeds waking each night_ she woke up one night and said she felt like someone was watching her and started to cry when she had to go to bed for fear of bad dreams. She was tired and crying over nothing. She couldn't express what was wrong. She said she felt lonely and sad.

Finally_ it dawned on me that this all began when we upped her zyrtec dose. I am so disappointed in my doctor for not checking into this. She is a small child_ only 40 lbs. and after researching Zyrtec_ took her off immediately. We did have to ween her off as she experienced withdrawal symptoms_ mainly extreme itchiness_ overall fatigue and feeling crummy.

It helped well with the allergies and drainage.  We didn't realize there was anything wrong_ we thought a lot of the behavior issues and defiance was his age.  We noticed the biggest change after he started Pre-K this past fall.  We started getting more and more reports from his teachers of his uncontrollable activity and behaviors as well of his lack of attention.  They requested that we speake with the Pediatrician regarding possible ADHD.  The problem was_ I wasn't seeing it at home much.  He took it at night before bed (every night since it was recommended).  I am thinking that he was the worst at school because by the time he was home the side-effects were starting to wear off and they were the strongest in the morning.

Who knows what is going one when they are blocked by an antihistamine.  No wonder there are so many psychiatric adverse effects being listed_ rather like antidepressants.  The children are the canaries in the mine.  If so many kids are having such SEVERE emotional and mental reactions_ you have to figure this med is TOXIC to ones brain.  This med should NOT be OTC.

592, 1, My young son- allergies,Our little boy had extremely negative and agressive behavior.  He had uncontrollable temper tantrums at home and in public.He also displayed seemingly depressive behavior. This is just to name a few of the side effects he experienced while taking zyrtec.,"Our son began taking zyrtec on a daily basis at 15 months old.  It was suggested to us by our pediatrician to assist in our ongoing battle with ear infections and allergies. Initially_ we contributed his behaviors to his age and ""being a boy"" although our first child_ also a boy_ had never experienced quite these same things.  As he got older_ we saw a significant increase in his physical agression as well as his extreme temper tantrums.  His behavior would turn on a dime and was almost impossible to anticipate.  As his primary caregiver during the day_ I was beginning to feel like I was losing my mind.  By the time my husband came home at night_ I was often in tears.  Finally_ on a whim_ I googled zyrtec/negative behaviors...I found a world of parents experiencing the same things as us.  At this point_ my little boy had been on the medication for over a year and a half.  I felt like we had never seen his real personality.  After that day_ we never gave him Zyrtec again_ EVER.  His behavior_literally_ changed overnight.  He is now 4-1/2 and has never ever behaved again as he did while on that drug.  Although not all children will react in such a negative way_ for us_ it was truly a nightmare.  When we look back on that time_ both my husband and I feel so sad about the fact that we were constantly giving him consequences for behavior that was truly out of his control.",F,35,2  years,12/29/2009Email,Zyrtec

Her asthma was getting worse and lasted longer.  Our doctor first suggested inhaled steroids but we tried zyrtec first and it has been a miracle for her.  NO asthma for 6 months so far.  This is unheard of for us.  I have seen no negative behavior changes.  If anything her behavior_ mood_ and concentration have improved significantly.

The slightest conflict produces crying and tantrums that I have never before seen in her. She constantly complains that her legs ache and stomach hurts. She worries about ridiculous things she never was concerned with before_ and her grandmother has even gone so far as to call her paranoid. Again_ this has all started only since I began giving her the medicine and this site has been eye opening for me. The worst part- she is still having allergy symptoms. She took her last dose of Zyrtec last night and she is scheduled to see an ENT doctor to see if her allergy symptoms are not an anatomical issue.,F,5,3  months,12/4/2009,Zyrtec

However_ the side effects that I experienced to this drug are simply not worth taking it. The most significant of these side effects would be fatigue. Since I've been taking cetirizine hcl (zyrtec generic)_ I have been able to sleep for hours and always wake up more tired than before. Throughout the day I constantly feel weak_ unmotivated_ and emotionally distraught causing me to have difficulty concentrating and doing well in school. I'm going to try switching to another antihistamine because I want to be able to enjoy life again.

I spoke to his teachers_ counselors_ the doctor and everyone said he was just having transition issues. I didn't buy it and at my mother's suggestion_ started to research all of the medications he was taking for the asthma. Low and behold_ Zyrtec has all of these crazy side effects. Who knew?!

We never associated the meds with the problem...went to child therapist even....and we noticed some improvement in behavior as he grew (and we understand now_ as his body got bigger and the dosage stayed the same...making the side effects a bit less potent).  Finally_ the Dr. suggested taking a ""summer off"" the meds to see what would happen (medically not behaviorally) since he had not had any asthma issues in a while.  So_ the summer when he was six_ we weaned him off.  We didn't make the connection yet but_ he gradually became such a delight....we attributed it to maturity..and he started first grade like a new boy!

Doctors said I had too much job stress. GP said I needed something for anxiety. My heart was pounding even when at rest. During the night I would wake up with a rapid fluttering. Thought I had heart trouble. I realized the problems started with the Zyrtec because I keep a blood pressure diary and it all coincides. Asked the pharmacist if Zyrtec could cause any of the symptoms I was having and had an AHA moment. All symptoms stopped after off of it for 4 days.

639, 1, allergies,The first several weeks_ I felt great. Helped with allergies_ and I had a ton of energy and motivation. Around week 4_ I started experiencing extreme anxiety_ depression_ rage_ hopelessness_ sleeplessness_ paranoia_ and suicidal thoughts -- all of which steadily increased. It scared the crap out of me. I thought I was losing my mind. I gained 10 pounds over the 6 months I took Zyrtec. It also affected my bladder: I didn't sleep for literally nights on end_ because every time I'd lie down_ I'd feel my bladder spasming and would suddenly have to urinate VERY badly. I'd go_ and it was as though I'd just chugged 8 glasses of water. I'd get back in bed_ and two minutes later_ the same thing_ and this lasted ALL NIGHT. I have no idea how I could produce that much urine (sorry_ this is gross)_ but it was clearly abnormal.It stopped as soon as I stopped taking Zyrtec.,I can't believe this drug is sold over the counter. In 2006_ my doc put me on it_ 1 tablet a day_ because I have a history of seasonal and food allergies. After 6 months of taking it_ I was trying to figure out what changed in my life when I started having the severe depression_ suicidal thoughts_ bladder issues_ etc._ and in an epiphany moment_ I realized it all began when I started taking Zyrtec. I immediately saw my doc and told her what had been going on. She confirmed that some people react very badly to this drug and told me to stop taking it. I did_ cold turkey_ and immediately went into a severe withdrawal that lasted for 3 weeks: I got an itchy rash all over my arms_ I had a headache like nobody's business that lasted for 10 days_ my muscles were sore -- but within 2 days_ my mental state improved drastically. The longer I was off this drug_ the better I felt_ and I started to immediately drop the weight I'd gained.If you take this drug_ PLEASE monitor your mental state and stop taking it right away if your behavior changes for the negative_ you become depressed_ suicidal_ etc. Some seasonal allergies can be greatly helped by changes to one's diet_ so look into that as an alternative. Don't give this to child or anyone else who isn't able to articulate potential side effects. Please_ please be careful. This is a very dangerous_ toxic drug.,F,34,6  months,9/19/2009,Zyrtec
640, 1, allergy induced asthma,My 4 yr old daughter has experienced similar behavioral problems for the past year.  I thought was due to an extensive remodel where I was away from her_ a move and my return to work.  Initially her behavioral issues presented themselves in stores and at ballet and tumbling classes with either all over the place and not listening behavior to spaciness.  Behavior has escalated to rage and physical hitting directed at me_ defiance_ not listening.  My husband and I traced back our last year and thought she may have a hearing issue but after reading all of these comments_ the zrytec is going in the trash for both of my daughter and I.  I have been on zrytec since April and I have experienced the sluggishness_ weight gain_ head in a vacumn_ heart palpatations_ anxiety attacks and rage.

642, 1, Allergies,My 8 yo daughter took Zyrtec once_ ONCE and FAINTED at school the next day. A whole 5 mg of the stuff did it!! It was very unsettling to receive a call at work from the school nurse saying your daughter has fainted. She was eating cheese sticks for lunch and fell back as she lost consciousness. School staff were concerned she could have choked on food parts in her mouth or throat. The sad part of it all (as if the fainting was not enough) is the only reason we gave her Zyrtec was because the local pharmacy didn't have Benadryl strips when I went out on Sunday night to buy some. I'm back w/Benadryl. And will look into natural remedies as well.,Am now further convinced the FDA is really not on the ball_ big pharma is out for profits ONLY.,F,8,1  days,9/16/2009,Zyrtec

My son would have some of those symtoms and also nosebleeds. We began researching the side effects of this and realized that it was this drug causing it. My son informed me that every nosebleed he has had was when he was taking the Zyrtec. I thought about it and he was right. He has also used nasal sprays and his peditrician and I thought that was causing the nosebleeds_ but he wasn't using it this time.

Never had a panic attack before taking this drug. This allergy season I have been a miserable person to be around. Ready to fight all the time. Feeling violent. Lots of rage. I never thought that I could get hooked on a drug I only used as needed. Been off it for four days now. Terrible withdrawl. Crazy itchy and feeling sick. I just feel like I'm going crazy.

673, 3, seasonal allergies,Extreme tiredness_ weird feelings_ spaciness_ slight depression_ headaches_ hairloss_ and dizziness.,I started taking Zyrtec about 3 months ago instead of Xyzal or Allegra because my insurance wouldn't cover those anymore. I am just now realizing that perhaps that is why I lost alot of hair the first month I was on this. I can not take a full dose because I get a terriable headache. I cut the dose in half and take it every couple of days. It's much too strong for me. I also get so tired to the point of being unable to function and have to go to bed. I become real depressed and have weird thoughts. When I went off it for a few days all the symptoms were gone. It's unbelievable the side effects drugs can give you even when they may help you at the same time. I also get dizzy and have some racing heart feelings and palpatations. That could be the drug or some other issue I have with perimenopause of low vitamin levels. Anyhow...it has mainly been going on while being on Zyrtec. I am definately going to search for another option for me.,F,44,3  months,8/2/2009Email,Zyrtec

I started taking this in mid June for allergies that sucked_ the kind with the itchy eyes_ runny nose_ sore throat_ you know. Basically_ i turned into an angry aggressive_ angry_ hostile_ combative_ miserable monster woman. My boyfriend (who I had been with over a year) called me a spiteful angry bitch. I would pick fights over comments such as ""You seem tired today_ take a nap maybe you'll feel better."" ""Do you need help with (insert action here)?"". I cant believe I let this go on this long...My mother asked me if anything on this planet made me happy_ because apparently_ i was a miserable person. I cried over nothing. Honestly_ i cant even remember I time in the past month I cried over something rational. Come to think of it_ I cant remember the last time this month that I fought over something rational. I honestly thought I was just a basically bad person.I'm never taking this medication EVER again_ and it was this website that made me realize how awful it was before it dawned on me that my symptoms all started last month. I'm starting to with draw though (according to other people on the site saying that they did too_ with the same symptoms. Dizzy_ restless_ headaches...).

Prior to taking this_ I was slender and in great health.  I am not taking any other medication.  In the seven years I have been taking Zyrtec_ I have gained 20 lbs.  I have not changed eating or fitness levels.  I began noticing hair loss four years ago.  My menstrual cycles have gone crazy and my vision has changed as now I need glasses to read and sometimes cannot focus for the first couple of hours each morning.

Took benadryl to help me breath_ doctor prescribed inhaler.  wheezing episodes would come earlier and earlier.  Finally_ my husband and I sat down and eventually associated all the above symptoms with the time I started taking zyrtec on a consistent and daily basis.4th month--- stopped taking zyrtec and antidepressants_ had headaches a couple days_ felt,This happened about a year ago_ after some research online_ I believe I had a rare allergic reaction to zyrtec_ and that the drug was broken down in my system producing a chemical which caused the psychiatric effects.  I think most people can probably take this drug without problem_ but should be aware of the possibility of rare reaction.  I also react to other allergy medicines_ claritin has lost its effect on allergies over the years so I stopped taking it_ but I remember it caused restless dreams (not nightmares) so I would take it in the morning always.  Benadryl causes drowsiness_ and Singular I only took once but both times I had norrible nightmares_ one of which I woke up in the middle of the night and I felt like a needle was being pushed through my foot which didn't go away for several minutes.  I now take flonase occasionally with allergy eye drops and elidel for my excema_ all on an as needed basis and I never get the complete relief that I had with zyrtec.  I'm sure steriod shots would work for me but I haven't tried it and I'm not excited about it.  We switch between a variety of allergy medications for our son as needed_ and including zyrtec.

The 10mg over the counter product. I would say maybe 4 or 5 days in a row and now I feel wired_ and yucky like if I had caffeine. I avoid caffeine cause I dont like that wired feeling. I also have mild nausea. And overall dont fell right. And I do feel bloated. I took a 10mg pill this morning at 10am. I will not take it ever again and will have to report back to tell the changes in how I felt not taking it.

I thought I had developed an allergy to my moisturizer and lipstick_ so I changed to non-allergenic products with no effect. My nostrils were also dry and scabby. Recently_ I had several nose bleeds. At my annual checkup_ the optomotrist diagnosed chronic dry eyes and prescribed Restasis_ which contains cyclosporine_ a powerful drug used by transplant patients to prevent organ rejection. About this time_ I had my teeth cleaned_ and the dental hygienist diagnosed dry mouth_ which is causing plaque to form at the top of my porcelain crowns. (In a healthy mouth_ saliva helps rinse decay-forming bacteria from the teeth.) Chronic dry eyes_ nose bleeds_ and dry mouth motivated me to research Zyrtec.

It was suggested to help aid skin irritation and sinus.Benadryl left me feeling a little groggy but workable.  I took one 10mg Zyrtec at night.  I was frustrated it didn't help all that much_ I was surprised I felt more groggy for what I was told is not as strong of a medicine as benadryl. I didn't connect things until I decided to stop taking it about a week ago.  I had become noticeably more sad and I was gaining weight and no longer up to working out.  I was shocked I noticed the sadness went away that had been building and I dropped a pound_ water weight likely almost immediately.

The positive side of Benadryl_ if there is one_ is you can by the 4-hour caplets and break them in half.  Then you take it at night and it wears off by the next day.

715, 2, Allergies,Mood changes_ aggression_ social anxiety_ clingyness,My 3 year old son has been taking this medication for over a year. We hadn't connected the behavior changes with the medication until it was suggested that the issues were not necessarily just the terrible twos. He has been off of it for 4 days and I am already starting to notice a difference. He is less clingy_ more social_ and generally less aggressive with his sister. I am not saying not to take it_ but for us_ the side effects clearly over shadow the possible benefits. Planning on stocking up on benedryl!,M,3,1  years,6/2/2009,Zyrtec

717, 1, seasonal allergies,My 2 and 1/2 yr old son was on zytec (liquid - 1/2 tsp) for red itchy eyes for the last 3 days... the drastic change I have seen in him is FRIGHTENING.  Our normally calm_ sweet_ mindful boy was combative_ hyper_ defiant_ and not listening to me to the point that I had to put him in the car b/c I was so wrought out.  After reading several comments from others_ I have now realized that it is the Zyrtec that is making him act this way.  My husband and I are NOT giving this tom him effective tonight... I just hope his behavior stops as soon as we stop giving him the Zyrtec.  I wish that someone would have informed us of this awful side effect OR the box would warn us!!!

718, 1, allergies,Obsessive-compulsive disorderDefiant behaviorProblems with concentratingAnxiousness,Two weeks ago we noticed a radical change in our 9 year old sons behavior. At first we noticed his obsessive-compulsive disorder. He began picking things around_ filling his pockets and was unable to throw them away. He was touching things with his arm to the point to have bruises. He became obsessed with symetrie_ and trying to get things in order.He became unable to concentrate at school or for homework_ unable to obey.He was feeling extremely anxious and began having violent impulsions that_ luckily_ he managed to control to a certain point. Once he suddenly stabbed a pencil in my back .As I turned I saw his sweet little face saying « oops_ sorry Mom_ Just had to do it »He realized he changed_  he was suffering and kept saying that he wants to become normal again_ just as his friends_ just as he used to be before.We were desperately trying to find the reason of this sudden change as he used to be a normal child_ NEVER violent.At one point I thought of the fact that about three weeks ago he started taking Virlix which is the French name for Zyrtec_ and luckily I found this site.We stopped giving it to him 2 days ago. The change is radical_ our joyful son is back. Still some sporadic OCD gestures left_ hopefully it will go away as well.,M,9,20  days,6/2/2009,Zyrtec
719, 1, Allergies,My 5 year old daughter was prescribed OTC liquid Zyrtec by her doctor after an allergic reaction to a cat. She took it for 2-3 weeks. She became extremely combative_ aggressive_ hitting_ kicking_ fighting_ screaming_ crying_ throwing tantrums_ etc.,"Her behavior was so unusual and out of control_ that I began thinking about what had changed during that period of time and remembered she had started taking Zyrtec. I stopped the Zyrtec and her behavior changed immediately back to her normal 5 year old self. The change was dramatic and obvious. I found this web site by googling side effects of Zyrtec. After reading some of the comments and my own experience_ I believe it is a crime that the manufacturer is not listing aggressive behavior as a side effect for children. I only went through this for a couple of weeks and it was awful_ I feel sorry for the parents and kids who were taking this drug and experiencing these side effects unbeknownst to them. My daughter kept telling me she ""couldn't help how she was behaving"" and cried and was sorry and upset she couldn't be a good girl. I now believe her that she couldn't helpt it_ because it changed immediately.I have also taken the pill form of Zyrtec myself for a couple of years to control my allergies and thought I had no side effects_ however_ I have slowly gained 30 lbs. over the past two years and wonder if this is related.",F,42,2  weeks,6/1/2009,Zyrtec

He is very aggressive and violent. He will also cry for no reason. Then apologize for his behavior...and 2 minutes later start all over again.

I remember I started crying when I had to reach for the number keys on my keyboard_ they seemed so far away! I spent the next 4 hours at my desk_ a complete zombie_ unable to move.

Product does a good job of alleviating allergy_ but in my opinion the manufacturer is criminally negligent in not disclosing the potential side-effects for smaller children.  Does not seem to affect all kids the same_ but when the side effects manifest themselves it's heart-breaking.  Prescribed to both sons_ 6 and 8.  The 8 year old seemed to have no problem with the medication.  The 6 year old went through a year of progressively more frequent and more irrational arguing and escalation.  Then would feel angry at homself over not being able to control it.  On an instinct we decided to stop medication to see if it helped.  Impact was immediate.  He is still a headstrong kid_ but he is rational_ feels good about himself_ and feels in control of hios emotions.  Kills me to think of how much confrontaion we could have avoided and the unneccessary emotional conflict it put on my 6 year old.  I didn't find this site until after we had stopped the medication_ was amazed at the fast impact_ and was looking to see if this was a published side effect.  Overnight_ with cessation of the medication_ the tantrum behavior that had built up to almost weekly clashes has been gone for the 90 days since we stopped the dosage.

You could see my pulse beating in my neck and I felt as if I was going to have a heart attack or something.  I really can't believe that this medication is available over the counter.  I see others have experienced the same thing.,M,45,4  days,4/13/2009,Zyrtec
768, 4, Allergies (pollen),Overall I've experienced less side effects with Zyrtec than most other over-the-counter medicines.  Benadryl works great_ but leaves me mentally on another planet.  Tylenol Allergy works fine for a couple of hours_ but within 4 hours it's wore off.  Claritin has no effect on me at all.  Only Zyrtec zaps out most of the symptoms.  Dizziness however_ does occasionally occur.,"I find that the ""3 days on_ 2 days off"" approach works great for stuff like this.  Take it for 3 days_ and then go OFF of it for 2-3 days.  This SEEMS to lessen any side effects and keeps it effective_ as taking it continuously will over time cause you to develop a resistance to just about any drug.  Dizziness does sometimes kick in when you make sudden turns or bend over_ so be prepared.  I experienced no other side effects other than that one.",M,43,3  weeks,4/12/2009Email,Zyrtec
769, 4, chronic allergies,brief sluggishness_ dry mouth.,Nothing ever worked for my allergies. Claritin had no effect. Allegra helped a little_ but upset my stomach. Zyrtec is (in my opinion) the best. After reading other posts I had to jump in and sing some praises. I've had no change in sex drive. I've had no change in sleep patterns. I was foggy for a day or two when I started taking it_ but that passed. The dry mouth went away also. I think its a matter of body chemistry and specific allergies. For my scenario where everything makes me itch and sneeze_ zyrtec works. I've been on for 2 years_ and was on a few years prior to that... there was a lapse of time where my insurance didn't cover it and it wasn't OTC yet where I suffered.,M,29,2  years,4/8/2009,Zyrtec

Occasional itching of shoulders_ legs an ankles.,My Doctor perscribed Zyrtec for me 10 years ago for seasonal allergies. I was becoming increasingly tired_ I asked to switch to something else and within two days of being off Zyrtec I had intense itching. I went back to my doctor and was told to take the Zyrtec again. I requested a referal to an allergist. I saw an allergist within a week.I was still itching. I had testing for every allergy you can imagine.To my utter surprise I have NO ALLERGIES. My allergist said The itching I am experienceing is a possible withdrawl from zyrtec. I am now 11 days off zyrtec and I still have occasional intense itching. My advice to anyone whose Doctor prescribes allergy medicine_ see an ALLERGIST FIRST. I was shocked that I didn't have allergies and had taking that medicine for so many years.,F,44,10  years,4/8/2009,Zyrtec

Her breathing became better and the caughing subsided.,If symptoms for taking Zyrtec do not get better in a few days_ but seem to get worse_ consult your doctor right away.

I also experienced significant weight gain (20 lbs) and the medicine just didn't work well for my allergies compared to others to combat allergies_ although at least it did not make me tired.,I rarely have very negative reactions to drugs_ so I was surprised at the extent of my impairments with this medicine.  Once I went off it for several days_ my memory started to improve and I began to lose weight again.  I realize everyone is different so the drug might work okay for some people.

I think of all the things I'm going to miss_like puppy breath( only true dog lovers knows that wonderful smell). A new doctor has given me 7 days of an antibiotic_ Nasacort nose spray and 2 shots_ its now day 3 and I do not think it's going to work.

After reading this site_ its like OMG... the changes in him are from the Zyrtec.  He used to be a happy go lucky kid_ nothing rattled him_ he slept through the night.  Now he is angry and mean_ sleeps poorly_ having concentration problems in school_ having crying meltdowns_ being clingy.  It's like he has become a totally different child.  There is no rhyme or reason to his crying fits or his angery fits.  The hardest part of this for me to accept is that I did this to him_  I allowed a Doctor tell me there are no side effects to this drug.  When clearly there is_ my son was on 1 1/2 teaspoons a day per Doctors orders. (1/2 teaspoon more then recommend dose) I am stopping it TODAY!!! Hopefully by the end of April I'll have my little sweety back.

You won't recognize your child if you keep them on this drug.  This past year and a half has been a nightmare for me to watch my son turn into this depressed_ angry_ exhausted_ fits of crying and meltdown child.  I have spent the last year trying to figure out what has happen to my son_ and not been able to come up with an answer.

Vivid nightmares_ and feeling groggy in the morning.  Bloating and gas.  Weight gain. Frequent urination. It has been almost two weeks since I discontinued it_ and I am still feeling its nasty presence in my body.

I couldn't concentrate on anything at work and didn't have motivation or the energy to workout or do just about anything.  I couldn't remember anything either_ my memory seemed to be affected... probably from feeling so damn tired all day.   Anyway needless to say instead of taking Zyrtec_ I sold her cat on ebay.

792, 2, yes,Very cranky _ hitting _ yelling _ shouting _ getting really mad hard to control,I have seem many people concerns over the ZYRTEK _ CLARITIN _ SINGULAR especially on kids and read about the similar syntoms as i have seen for my 7 year old. But i never realized that those symptoms could be because of any of these medicines and as many specified the doctors or FDA does not mention these as side effects anywhere. I am glad that i found this site. In 2007 I was using an ayurvedic medicine for my sons allergies which was working perfectly with no side effects but then last year i took zyrtek again as it became available OTC and was a bit lazy ordering my ayurvedic medicine online. Now I am going to order it and would like to suggest it to moms who would like to try an alternative. It is called 'Septilin' by Himalaya herbals. Here is one link http://www.himalayausa.com/herbalformulas/immunocareliquid.htm . you can also search for it on google. And I also suggest to teach some yoga to the kids especially to asthma prone. I tried with my child and i see a lot of improvement. Doing 'Pranayama' is good for this which is a set of Breathing exercises. And in that especially 'Kapalabathi' exercise is very good. You can also search in youtube for Baba Ramdev exercises and demonstrations. You can get all the info on the above by a simple search in google. I hope this is helpful,M,7,1  years,3/24/2009,Zyrtec

At one point it got so bad we almost had her tested for Autism. We finally made the connection that her bad phases coincided exactly with allergy season and realized it was Zyrtec.  I was so relieved to find this web site and see that many others have come to the same conclusion.  Now that she is not taking it we have our little girl back.  It is wonderful.

Unfortunately my GM Dr. believing the bronchitus was bacterial and not getting better_ put me on another 2 series of antibiotics (in all - it was 3 in row (1st_ Z-Pac_ then 10 days of Levequin_ then 10 days of Amoxicillan) my lungs sounded worse and worse_ weasing_ bronchial spasms_ persistant coughing with what sounded like loads of phlem in my lungs. The Dr knew I had just started taking Zertec and he thought ""oh good"" it should help.

However - that appointment couldn't be scheduled for between 2-3 weeks. within one week_ I was was so distraught and having a bronchial spasm","The Cardio specialist took Xrays_ and breathing tests to see if I had cancer_ Emphasema_ or other possible deseases.

None of them really worked and they all made him very tired and drugged out. Recently_ I saw Dr Hansen on our morning news show here in Arizona as he was talking about a natural allergy product named Flavinox and explaining how it works and it really made sense to me. I drove over to his Scottsdale office that morning to get a bottle and went directly to my sons school to start him on the capsules.When he came home from school about 3 hours later he was like a different person than when he left that morning. I could see it in his face and eyes. He was feeling 100% better and he told me about an hour after he took the capsule he could feel the difference and he kept feeling better as the day went on. Since then I have been giving him about 3 capsules a day and he's a baseball player so sometimes before a game I give him an extra one and I am truly amazed a,M,12,1  years,3/7/2009,Zyrtec
810, 1, indoor allergies,I'm so thankful for finding this web site.  Our 3.5 year old son has been a different child while taking this medication.  I came here today in the off chance that the liquid form of zyrtec might be responsible...... I am relieved and sad to know so many other children have had the same side affects.  He is very angry_ won't eat_ disrespectful and sleeps fitfully.  He is off this stuff today!,,M,3.5,3  months,3/6/2009,Zyrtec
811, 1, Allergies,Daughter was angry all the time_ moody_ flash temper_ no patience for anything.,My daughter started Zyrtec when she was about 13_ she became terribly angry at everyone and everything. We blamed it on hormones_ peer pressure_ etc. etc.  She is now 15 and we just heard about theses problems with Zyrtec 8 days ago and you would not believe the change. I have my sweet daughter back! Not that there still aren't typical teenage drama etc. but she had become down right mean and nasty.  I wouldn't let anyone take this medicine.,F,15,2  years,3/5/2009,Zyrtec

814, 1, Allergies,My 7 year old daughter took this for 1 1/2 weeks.  I am sorry that I ever put her on it.  She is a sweet_ loving child who behaves very well.  She turned into a demon child.  She lost her apetite and would not eat anything at all.  She complained about stomach aches and dry throat.  She was afraid to eat or drink because she said her throat felt as if it would close up.,This product should be taken off of the market immediately.  I spoke to several moms tonight at a PTA meeting and they had the same complaints about their children. My daughter would scream at me and tell me that I dont understand her.  She would wake up and just start yelling at me.  My daughter wakes up sooo happy every day.  She was not herself in anyway.  I took her off of it 4 days ago... her apetite is back x 10 and my sweet_ loving_ caring child is back. It breaks my heart that I put her through that greif.

It made sense if years before it made me drowsy_ passing out seems like a logical step.,I dumped the pills.     My perspective:  DON'T TAKE IT.

I had found some very positive reviews regarding a vitamin called 'Quercetin' on the internet and so_ I began taking it (in combination with vitamin C).  I started with taking 4-5 tablets a day (my allergies are extremely high and year round)_ a month ago_ I was down to 1 a day and I am amazed!!

He is one of the most calm and collected people I have ever met_ but he was enraged from the morning after his first dose onward. He could not focus_ was fatigued even after a night's sleep_ and was angrier than I have *ever* seen him over nothing at all. The worst part was how irrational he became.

I saw the doctor and he said my hair loss was probably genetic. Everyone in my family has beautiful thick hair. Even the men. I became severely depressed. Over a period of about 8 months I loss nearly half my hair volume. Dr never related it to zyrtec. I reviewed the Physicians Desk Reference and discovered that alopecia is a side effect of this medication. Please! please check it out on drugs.com.

Excellent med and now OTC generic.,I think overall it's probably the most effective allergy med out there short of shots_ steroids_ etc.  I have terrible allergies - dust mites_ pets_ etc.- and all the other stuff did nothing for me. The reactions I'm reading from small children are probably related to adjusting to the drowsiness; children can't handle that as well as adults (I have four children...).  My kids were on and off of it for years and I never had problems.

The first day I took it_ it was in the middle of the day because my allergies were so horrible I just wanted them to be lessened a bit. Started taking them at night and now I talk in my sleep and sleep walk which I have never done.  I'm also forgetting things that I shouldn't be forgetting. I can't say whether or not its helped my allergies because it was a full blown allergy attack when I first took it. It lessened my symptoms dramatically but they haven't dissapeared completely yet.

842, 3, Severe allergies,I have been depressed since I began taking Zyrtec_ but because my girlfriend and I broke up around the same time that I started taking the medicine_ I assumed that the termination of the relationship was the cause. After frustrations with being tired all of the time and remembering the same effects when taking diphenhydramine_ I decided to utilize the internet to research common side effects of Zyrtec. It all makes sense now. Being down about the termination of a relationship is one thing_ but not wanting to move or do anything is something else entirely. I would imagine that the medication increases one's susceptibility to depression_ and when one is forced to deal with a difficult situation_ depression is more likely to ensue. I have also experienced the insomnia and withdrawal headaches described on this website: http://zyrtecsideeffects.blogspot.com/.,As an antihistamine_ it performed wonderfully; my allergy symptoms were almost completely eradicated.

I thought perhaps the symptoms might have been coicidental and tried Zyrtec again recently.  After 3-4 doses_ I again had to drag myself out of bed and felt depressed to the point of tearfulness.  Within a couple of days of not taking the Zyrtec_ my energy and mood was much better and the symptoms have not returned.  I had experienced similar symptoms during the peri-menopausal period of my life_ but only after taking Zyrtec have I felt as bad since that period.

I was very emotional and fragile with frequent mood swings. I was having migraines weekly. I honestly thought that I could be having a nervous breakdown. Then I stopped taking Zyrtec. My leg weakness disappeared and I was not anxious/jittery. Things went back to normal. I recently had another allergic reaction to antibiotics and was itching again and so I took it for three days.

For the last month I have been a complete emotional wreck_ with anxiety_ paranoia_ problems with concentration and mood-swings.  Although this drug is very affective with my allergies_ I have also gained weight with no change in diet (vegan_ very healthy) and the depression is simply unbearable. Please do not take this drug if you have previously struggled with depression!!!,F,27,1  months,11/17/2008,Zyrtec
864, 1, Seasonal Allergies,Excessive Weight gain_ lethargy_ depression_ sadness_ mood swings,It only occured to me this morning that my allergy medicine migh be the cause of my 10-15 lb. inexplicable weight gain over the last 6 months.  It was a stretch_ in my mind_ but worth a google search_ nevertheless.  I was amazed that so many others had the same symptoms.  I have had multiple blood tests for anything that can explain my ballooning weight and sudden onset of depression_ fatigue and uncurable bad mood.  One dr thought it was a thyroid problem. Another thought it was my birth control pill.  Maybe I am just crazy and fat and looking for something to blame it on_ but I can't wait to see if going off zyrtec will help.  I mean_ I run marathons for Christ's sake.  I don't eat junk as a rule.  I have never gained more than a few lbs since I was 15.  God_ I hope it's the zyrtec.,F,33,6  months,11/17/2008,Zyrtec

I thought I was going crazy.  Since starting Zyrtec four months ago I have gained ten pounds despite a healthy diet and fanatically regular exercise including running and weight training.  Many of my side effects mimic my premenstrual symptoms but I stopped making excuses when my wrists were swelling so much during the day my watch would get tighter and tighter.  I am dumbfounded that a drug now available over the counter could have such significant side effects.

I never put many thing together because when she started taking the medicine was the same time children at the age of 3 start acting out - crying about nothing - temper tantrums - etc.  Her doctor recommended that she take the 10 mg 2 times a day due to her itchy reaction to her allergies.  Unfortunately_ I never questioned the behavior side effects of this medicine.  My daughters 1st grade teacher asked me to look into the effects of zyrtec and how effects children.  I am shocked at what I have read!  As of today she is no longer taking the medicine!  We are looking for a natural alternative!  However_ she does get monthly shots to help build her immune system and we are as of now going to continue with the shots_ BUT no more zyrtec!  We are hoping that her emotional outburst will get better ... who would have thought ????

871, 1, Allergies,While taking Zyrtec_ I noticed an inability to focus and organize my thoughts as well as a substantial decrease in attention span.  My memory was not as sharp_ almost porous_ as though I was physically present but without awareness.  I became forgetful.  I started to procrastinate and found it quite difficult_not to start_ but to complete projects_  either work or personal.  I was quite irritable and easily frustrated - not a fun person to be around.  I only took Zyrtec for 2 month.   When my seasonal allergy symptoms began to subside_ I stopped taking Zyrtec and within a few days_ I noticed all of the above symptoms begin to subside.,Although Zyrtec did work in relieving my allergy symptoms_ I would never take it again due to the life altering side effects.

875, 1, asthma triggered by allergies,My 8 year old son has been taking Zyrtec for nearly 4 years. During that time_ we have struggled with him concentrating in school and learning to read. We even had him repeat kindergarten and attend private reading tutoring for 1.5 years ($4760!!). We were about to invest $2500 in a private neuropsychological evaluation to see if he had a learning disability or ADD. Almost two weeks ago_ I discontinued the Zyrtec in preparation for allergy testing. In that time_ his teacher and reading tutor reported a measurable leap in his attention span and reading performance. We saw it at home too. Similar experiences posted to this site has confirmed my suspicion about the connection to this amazing turn-around and the cessation of his Zyrtec.

But after a few weeks I started to develop serious pains especially in my neck_ shoulders and chest muscles. The pain was on par with or worse than when I had a serious muscle pull. I did some research and saw that Zyrtec could have these side effects and stopped taking it. Within a week the pains subsided. After I stopped taking it I also realized that my mood had been severly affected. I was ready to leave my wife and a long planned vacation was almost completely un-enjoyable. These symptoms too ended when I stopped taking Zyrtec. However_ the pains from this drug never fully went away and my doctors are trying to figure out if the chronic pains I am experiencing are related to the use of Zyrtec. All blood tests are normal_ but since I took Zyrtec I have had no weeks when I have been fully free of aches and pains.

When prescribed low dose of SSRI -- Major depression_ Mood changes_ irritability_ sleepiness_ inability to concentrate_ personality change_  PLEASE SEE RESEARCH ABOUT gene CYP2D6 which affects metabolism of this drug.,Please read up on CYP2D6 before taking Zyrtec or giving this to your children!  It is the main pathway for the metabolism of zyrtec and if a person has a certain genetic variation_ side effects may come on gradually and a large number of medications can cause serious drug interactions with it.  About 6-10% of our population has this genetic variation which has do with the channels the medications are metabolized in the liver.  Funny thing is_ a side effect of one medication may lead to the prescription of the second .... and the downward spiral begins.  Beware in children and adolescents! If you suspect you may fall into this genetic profile_ please look to alternative allergy medications.  A frightening experience.

I suffered headaches_ stomach problems_ and feelings of rage and anger that I thought were symptoms of PMS or stress related. Last weekend_ I was visiting my sister_ who has a cat_ and I forgot to take my nighttime dose. I took it the next morning and drove four hours home. I was EXHAUSTED.

BUT_ I feel so happy_ relaxed_ and with the help of my nettie pot_ no nasal allergy symptoms.

Have been off the antibiotics for almost a week and still haven't lost the 6 pounds.  No doubt that the Zyrtec caused this.  Very blurry vision in the evenings (about 8-10 hours after taking it).  Spacey feeling all the time.  Face looks sunburned_ but that may be from the antibiotics.  ,Helps for a few hours_ but no where near the 24 hours that it is supposed to.  I realize it's effectiveness is essentially a bellcurve with it peaking a few hours after taking it and slowly wearing off.  But_ if I take it in the morning_ by 2pm_ it's worn off.  If I take it at lunch_ it gets me to about 7pm.  So_ only works for about 8 hours for me.  It's either breathe during the day or breathe at night.  Allegra and Claritin do nothing for me_ either.  Was hoping this would work_ but so far_ it hasn't.  I gained weight on Allegra_ too.  Quit taking it and the weight came off.  But_ now that fall has arrived_ I've got to start back on something else.,F,38,10  days,9/29/2008,Zyrtec

We even get comments from people in public about how well mannered he is.  It is actually the only medicine that keeps his itchy eyes and nose in check.  We've also added an over the counter allergy eye drop by Similisan.  We notice a big differnce within 2 days if he has not taken his pill.  Thank God for Zyrtec.,M,7,3  years,9/23/2008,Zyrtec

912, 1, seasonal allergies,My 9 year old son started zyrtec on a daily basis at the end of August to help with seasonal allergies that trigger his asthma.  He started becoming extremely emotional both at home and at school.  Knowing that normally he would never cry at school if he could help it I started questioning the Zyrtec.  I decided to take him off for a week and see where we were at and immediately saw improvement at home.  Then I was called into the classroom by his teacher because she wanted to tell me what a huge change she saw at school overnight!  She explained that she was very worried about my son's transition into 4th grade but now she is confident he is doing fine! She claims he is like a whole different kid in the classroom than what she has been witnessing the 3 weeks prior since the start of school.  I would decribe his side effects as fatigue_ lack of concentration_ weepy_ depressed.,If your child is suffering from anxiety_ depression and being very emotional take them off Zyrtec!  Huge improvement over night!,M,9,1  months,9/22/2008,Zyrtec

I know this sounds funny and crazy but this pill made me do things I would not normally do. I found myself fantasizing about being famous. My inner most desires were trying to be fulfilled and I was unhappy about my lot in life. I am a positive_ happy person and everyone noticed my sadness and glazed over looks.

She is also very argrey _ easy to cry and very moody. I can tell her NO and she cries for like ten minutes before she would just keep going letting nothing stop her.,I would not recomind Zyretc to anyone with small childen.

Since that time I have become increasingly agitated and anxious.  Today I have felt like I had had about 20 cups of coffee and feel like I can't relax at all.  I am also really bloated.,I saw my chiropractor today who is also into nutrition.  I told him what was going on and he said I was most likely experiencing side effects of the prednisone and zyrtec.  I can't remember everything he said_ but I'm done with the prednisone and I will no longer take the zyrtec.  A NATURAL ALTERNATIVE that I will use is Allerplex (made by Standard Process).  My chiro told me I could take 3-4_ 3 x day.  It's all natural and has helped my son's seasonal allergies a lot.  I wish I had taken it in the first place!!!,F,41,7  days,9/16/2008,Zyrtec

Then suddenly_ about  6 months ago I began feeling over angry concerning the smallest things... I pulled my wife's hair for running out of jelly and stomped to my bedroom and locked my self in my room. It took me about 3 months to figure out my daily rage was caused by the zyrtec.  As soon as I was off the medicine_ my rage feeling left me_ but the withdrawal symptoms were bad. I still have stomach aches_ get angry easily and feel sad for no reason at all.

Her cough has not improved and she says her throat is still itchy.  Nasal symptoms/stuffiness seems better_ but she's on Veramyst too.  The disturbing part is she has been having problems urinating (feeling like she has to go_ then can't go_ or accidentally leaking a bit in her pants).  She mentioned this before_ but I didn't take much notice of it_ till she told me again tonight and I got on this site.  She also has had comments of ""seeing horizontal blue lines"" or shadowy ""people' out of the corner of her eye a couple of times while she is watching TV. Took her to the eye dr. and her vision is perfect.  I'm thinking both of these symptoms may be due to Zyrtec_ so I will call her Dr. and take her off of it tomorrow.

I would give him Zyrtec just as needed. I noticed that he would be better some days_ but other days he could hardly speak.

Hitting other kids_ throwing toys_ becoming very angry over mild situations with other children_ very defiant_ just a real nightmare.  We stopped giving him the medication because we were just scared of the way his behavior had changed and we saw improvement for the most part.  Of course we were still giving it to him on and off as needed when his allergies would really act up so I think that's why his behavior never really improved fully.  I decided to give it to him last night because his allergies were really bad and today was the worst day I've ever had with his behavior.  I googled zyrtec and irritability and this site popped up.

She was having fits_ couldn't calm down when upset_ was constantly getting in trouble at day care and turned into a child that we did not know.

We took her off immediately because we were so desperate for a solution to her behavior problems.  Within two days_ she was back to normal!

Went to the local drug store and was told insurance would not pay for the antihistamine because it was the same thing as OTC Zyrtec and that the drug store had a generic brand which was cheaper. Started taking it on a Friday night all went well until the following Thursday night at work. Arrived at work normal time when roughly one hour into my shift I notice sweating over my entire body_ dizzy_ and completely unaware of my surroundings_ when suddenly I found myself passed out on a hard concrete floor with seizer like symptoms.

I have missed doses in the past and would wake up in the middle of the night itching and grabbing the bottle. In eight weeks I have gained 10 pounds and truthfully I have an amazing diet_ not to mention I am an avid runner but in the past few weeks I lacked the energy to go out and do it_ to tired or depressed.

I have taken Zyrtec a long time without (noticeable) side effects. Now I use generic medicins and capsules prepared at the local pharmacy that contain the active ingredients. Again_ no side effects. After reading some other medicine ratings_ it becomes clear to me that almost no one_ from what must be millions of people_ that have good results with 'rated' medicines_ post on this site_ which gives an overwhelming negative bias.

I was constantly dizzy and nauseous.  I spent most of the day in bed_ but I had trouble sleeping.  At first_ I thought I was getting sick_ but I felt fine otherwise.  Halfway through the second day of nausea_ I was thinking about what could have caused this.  My diet hasn't changed and I was exercising too_ the only thing different was the lack of Zyrtec in my system. It's Day 4 now and I'm feeling much better.

Also_ the progressive increase in people attributing anxiety/depression/anger to the drug_ when looking at posts over time from 2005 to 2008 suggests that people are simply convincing themselves that Zyrtec is to blame_ as they increasingly see others claim this.

However_ I put on 8 pounds in the first 4 weeks and another 3 in the last 2 weeks. I started getting migraines and frequent headaches always at 530 pm (I take it at 10pm) I could never get enough sleep. I never felt awake and the past 3 weeks my libido went to the crapper. In the last week I started these mood swings_ I felt like the world was against me_ I yelled at strangers if the spoke rudely to me_ I have been crying at the drop of a hat.Looking back to my experience from 10 years ago_ I was 19ish and I chalked my migraines_ sudden weight gain_ crying and everything,F,29,2  months,6/13/2008,Zyrtec

It is currently the only medicine on the market that helped me breathe...however I've gained nearly 80 pounds while on it.  I still work out 3-4 times a week at the gym_ and walk daily. It's like exercise effects in reverse.  Since Zyrtec went OTC_ my allergies are back in high gear and I take the Walgreens version which works like the Rx version of Zyrtec. My sister has been on Zyrtec for 5 years and not only did she hit the massive weight gain too-- she was the nicest person before taking it--now she's a nightmare--from nice and calm to violent rage in less than a second!  My doctor blamed me turning 30 as the reason for weight gain and even put me on a high protien_ low carb diet...did it work--absolutely not.  The excessive weight triggers my asthma so then around the circle we go again being prescirbed steroids  to calm my lungs down.

I must note that my daughter has NEVER exhibited such behaviour that other posts are stating.  Every child has tantrums_ mood swings and bad behaviour simply because they are children_ that is what they do.  From personal experience_ this medicine had no bad side effects on my daughter.  No side effects such as drowsiness_ negative emotional behaviour_ seizures or any other effects.  I believe the overall drug changed as soon as it went over the counter thus it no longer works.  ,Overall zyrtec has been a wonderful medicine but no longer effective once it went over the counter.

Then_ after about 2 wks_ his demeanor changed from happy to depressive and he whined and complained constantly. His behavior became increasingly hyperactive_ aggressive and violent. We were puzzled_ since he is normally a very happy_ gentle_ sweet and loving child. Our concerns grew stronger when his violent outbusts became more frequent_ often leading to us having to physically restrain him in order to prevent his hitting and kicking us.

Allergy doc said there were A LOT of neural side-effects in some people.  I am an insane zombie with major anger issues on this drug but I only vaguely realize how I'm behaving.  Getting off is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.  The itching starts in hands/feet if I miss a dose (I take it at night_ itching by the next morning).  I did not have this symptom before zyrtec.  I've never made it more than 3 days before because it is unbearable.  But now I think I may be allergic to Zyrtec.  Took it this morning after being off for 3 da,May be fine for some people but definitely not good for others!  There are a lot of reports on this and other sites about the side-effects of this drug (even in adults) and the HORRIBLE WITHDRAWAL.  If you have mental symptoms and confusion while taking Zyrtec_ it is hard to realize that you are having problems.  I needed major coffee to stay awake while on this drug but still wasn't functioning well.  This product can be addictive...I've had 2 doctors tell me that my symptoms were zytec withdrawal.  Functioning at work has been severly impaired...hopefully not to the point to wreck me career but I've been on it for 8 years so I'm worried.  I didn't realize all the problems it was causing until I started to get off it.  Still wasn't back to normal but noticed the dramatic and sudden change an hour after taking the last dose (which will be my last dose).  Will have to try to get through the ITCH (feels like ants walking around under my skin).  I hear that it lasts 16 days to several mon,F,34,8  years,5/1/2008,Zyrtec
1011, 1, allergies - indoor and out,severe anxiety and panic attacks,Initially_ I felt like this was a miracle drug.  I am an RN_ and remembered that when my daughter took this drug as a child she became very mean_ and irritable.  I did not think it would affect me this way.  I have a history of sinus problems and have had sinus surgery.  I was taking Claritin D 24 hour with a lot of success in the past_ but lately found that I was having more sinus infections.  I thought that the Claritin D 24 hr was causing too much dryness_ and led to increased mucous collecting in my sinus cavities.  So_ I thought I would try Zyrtec D 12 hour to see if it helped keep my sinuses draining better_ and thus help prevent infections.  I knew it had recently become available OTC_ and my physician had recommended it in the past.  However_ I never took it because of the experience I had with my youngest daughter when she had taken it as a child.  At first I thought I had found the wonder drug of all drugs for allergies.

I have had unusual anger issues to the point that my husband didn't know me_ depression_ highs and lows_ dry mouth_ not necessarily suicidal but I didn't care if I lived or died. But the worst is stomach pain! I am going to stop taking this stuff to verify that this pain is truly coming from Zyrtec. I have had on and off stomach acid for several days_ but after being up last night till 3am with unbearable stomach pain I decided to research symptoms and side effects of this drug. I take it with food so I dont think the pain is from taking it on an empty stomach. I have never experienced stomach acid problems. It's as though I have swallowed a red hot poker.

With this very strong feeling i felt terribly depressed and even feeling a little suicidal_ dizzy_ mentally strained and an overall ""zombie-like"" high feeling. I could also not focus one bit on my school work and felt psychologically lost all day long. however it did work pretty well for my allergies_ but i really would not want to spend another day on Zyrtec. terrible drug_ how the hell is this over-the-counter? take this crap off the shelves.",M,18,1  days,4/22/2008,Zyrtec

1020, 1, seasonal and food allergies,My 5-year-old son was experiencing seasonal allergies and also hives_ we think from berries_ and the doctor prescribed him with Zyrtec.  We didn't notice any major behavioral issues but he did begin periodically to have what we thought were night terrors - wide-eyed_ screaming nightmares so vivid that it was increasingly difficult to wake him.  We stopped the Zyrtec when the hives and summer sniffles went away_ and the nightmares stopped_ too.  We still didn't put it together until last week_ when spring allergies started and we resumed the Zyrtec_ and the night terrors began again.,"We call this drug ""Nightmares in a Bottle_"" at least for our child.

1022, 1, to reduce fluid in ear,My once pleasant and polite 6 year old daughter turned into a she-devil.  She began having attacks that were almost panic-like.  She absolutely could not control herself.  We did not immediately make the connection to the medication as she had been taking it for approximately 6 weeks prior to these symptoms.  We started with behavior modifications and nothing worked then something clicked and I looked into drug side effects and was relieved to see that maybe it really wasn't something that she could control.  She has extreme night terrors and completely freaks out.  She cannot be controlled at these times.  She also has been very mean to her younger sister and cousin.  You cannot talk sense into her.  She has been off the medication for 4 days now and last night was the first night in 2 weeks that she did not freak out when she woke up in her bed.  She did wake up but only once with no behavior problems.  I am hopeful that as the medication leaves her system our daughter will return!,,F,6,6  weeks,4/20/2008Email,Zyrtec

It worked great on her allergy symptomms_ however her behavior changed and I couldn't tell why until weeks later a friend of mine told me about her daughter's experience with Zyrtec. My normally happy and sociable daughter was cranky all the time_ and would have meltdowns similar to those of a 2-year-old. She was crying non-stop on some days_ and just seemed overall miserable and depressed. I have stopped giving her Zyrtec 2 days ago and am hoping to see improvement soon.

1024, 5, Multiple allergies,Extreme itching if went 36 hours without a dose,I have been taking allergy medications for 40 years and went through several cycles of immunotherapy.  Zyrtec was very effective (about 95%) in treating allergy symptoms and preventing recurring sinus and ear infections.   In fact_ I told anyone that I talked to with allergies that Zyrtec was the best thing since sliced bread.  However_ I was very concerned about the withdrawal effect (extreme itching) and felt the drug might somehow be affecting my immune system. I originally only used the Zyrtec seasonally_ but for the past 2 or 3 years have used it year-round because of the itching I experienced when I stopped using it.   I have developed some arthritis_ dermatographia and gained 35 pounds since I have been on Zyrtec.  All I know for sure is that I can attribute the withdrawal itching to Zyrtec. Since Zyrtec has gone otc it is an added incentive to get off of it.  I tried going cold-turkey but went nuts with the itching.  I am using Claritin which causes me headaches and drowsiness,M,49,7  years,4/19/2008,Zyrtec

We tried giving it to him_ under doctors advice at the 18 hour point which did help. This bothered me_ giving a child so much medicine each day.  We tryed zyrtec this week.  Today markes day 3 and I will not be giving it to him again.  Yesterdy I noticed he was very irritable_ unable to focus on his homework and cranky.  Today he has had several temper tantrums and can not play with his friens.  I am so glad I found this site and realized that Zytec may be the cause.  I see that some have had trouble coming off the medication so before I give it to my child again I will stop now and go back to Claritin.,F,44,3  days,4/19/2008,Zyrtec

1027, 5, year-round allergies,None,I've been throught every other prescription allery medication and they all stopped working eventually. I was on Claritin for for some years (when it was still on prescription)_ and it gradually stopped working. Now it's like popping a sugar pill. Zyrtec works very well for me. I take it at night so that I get a benefit from any potential drowsiness_ though it doesn't seem to be a major factor. I've been on it so long that I've lost track_ but probably 10 years. If I stop_ I can go about 36 hours before the allery symptoms come back. And I agree with the comment about Zyrtec-D. I think it's pseudoephedrine that added to the zyrtec_ and that completely spaces me out. I guess you have to figure out what works for the individual.,F,55,10  years,4/18/2008,Zyrtec
1028, 4, Allergies and related asthma,Withdrawal causes terrible itching.  The drug works great for me.  It stops allegic symptoms and does not cause me side effects.  However_ if I miss a morning pill_ the itching begins by early evening.  It starts on my palms and feet_ and then spreads up my legs.  If I scratch_ it gets all red and itches worse.  I went to an allergist who was skeptical that it could be withdrawal.  She said that the drug might be surpressing underlying hives that return when the drug stops.  But I have never had hives and it happens every time like clockwork.  So_ I am just staying on the drug for now.,,M,44,7  years,4/18/2008,Zyrtec
1029, 2, sinus/allergies,At first_ the drug was a godsend. I could only take it at bedtime_ and I learned that the normal dosage for me was only 1/2 of a pill. If I took a whole pill at bed time_ the next morning I could barely stay awake to drive to work. After taking the drug_ seasonally_ for about 3-4 years_ I began developing new allergies. I once had an allergic reaction to two mosquito bites on the same leg. My blood pressure shot sky-high_ but a dose of Zyrtec brought everything under control. I got so I could not sleep without it. Highly addictive for me in this regard. It took me four months to kick it. I spent many long nights awake. I finally weaned myself by taking half a pill on alternate days_ then dropped to a quarter of a pill_ then a quarter of a pill on alternate days. Finally_ I am off the drug---Thank God! I am sleeping better than I have in years_ and my allergies are much better.,Was paying $80. for 30 pills_ then they made it an over-the-counter drug_ wouldn't you know it_ just as I was getting off the drug.,F,60,5  years,4/18/2008,Zyrtec

However_ I began to feel that I was becoming very sad. It started so slow that I didn't realize it at first. I had achy bones_ and was tired all the time. I thought I had a aerious illness. But worse than that was that over the three months I became more and more weepy and sad. Then I heard that Zyrtec can make you sleepy_ so I stopped taking it. By the next day_ I suddently realized I was happy again_ I was my old self. Now looking back_ I see how I was sinking into a deeper and deeper sadness_ but didn't realize it. When on this drug_ as the days went on_ I went from being sad_ having no energy_ to crying over every little thing. For me_ it was a slow progression into deep sadness. Looking back_ i now see how bad off I was. So I will put up with coughing. I'm so glad I stopped it when I did. There is not telling how far down I would have gone.

I have never experienced depression before_ so I didn't even know what was happening to me. I thought I was stressed out or eating bad or tired or something_ but then my wife said I may be having depression from the zyrtec.

So the doctor switched me to something else which represses my immune system so it will stop fighting the pennicillin which has already left my body days ago?? I also suddenly craved snacks and food_ I ate two tubs of Ben&Jerry's in three days_ I usually never eat that. The night after I stopped taking Zyrtec the hives I alreay had from the allergic reaction had become far itchier than they had ever been and I couldn't sleep all night. I took another pill just before stubmbling upon this site because I thought it might help the itch. I'm regretting that_ but the itch is still not gone hours after taking the Zyrtec eventhough I hear others speak of immediate itch-relief.,After reading all of these comments I am quitting zyrtec immediately_ I will take benedryl against the itch and just tough this thing out. Hopefully_ since I have only taken zyrtec for a few days I will not experience the weeks of itching others talk about. in teh past I have taken zyrtec twice over a few weeks with no problems_ although the allergy_ just as it does now_ took a ridiculously long time to disappear.

However since starting Zyrtec about 2 months ago_ I have been needing 9-10 hours of sleep_ and still have a hard time getting out of bed.

I wonder how many of you were/are suspect of medication to begin with_ as many of these symptoms sound psychosomatic. And kids? Kids are_ by virtue of being learning machines_ always changing_ and are thus frequently unruly_ unpredictable_ or difficult. That said_ they are also extra-sensitive to the mental (side-) effects of any drug (or food_ for that matter. Hippocrates himself said_ ""Let your medicine be your food_ and your food your medicine."") for related reasons - developing brains_ fast metabolisms_ and little organs. So... think hard before feeding your kids pills_ and don't expect a magically perfect cure devoid of any side-effects; modern Western medicine is still all about treating symptoms_ be they proximal or fundamental. (Until there are several more generations of advances in genetics_ treating causes is nigh impossible.)

1055, 3, Allergies,I have taken Zyrtec probably since about 1996. I noticed whenever I tried to stop taking it I would get itchy. If I take it then it stops. I always thought that was why I was taking it to stop the itching. Now after reading other people's ratings_ I am finding out that trying to stop it is what is causing the itching. I always take it at night_ because at first it did make my sleepy. If I don't take one at night by morning I am starting to itch_ palms of hands and feet_ head_ arms. I am going to see if I can get off of it and the itching goes away. Claritin just doesn't stop the itching.,I am shocked that what I might actually be experiencing is withdrawal from this medicine.

1100, 1, Chronic post-nasal drip/allergies,increased blood pressure_ heart palpitations_ anxiety,5 days ago my doctor prescribed Zyrtec to deal with chronic post-nasal drip due to allergies. After the first day of taking (at night)_ I woke up feeling anxious and my heart was fluttering/palpitating. Since these were not listed side effects on the insert_ I thought that perhaps I was just having an off day. Five days later and feeling the same_ I was having a check up with another doctor_ who informed me my blood pressure was 130/96 when it had been 120/70 just 5 days before--which is also strange because I am fit and otherwise healthy. I called my primary care doctor_ who said to discontinue the medicine because it can have cause increases in blood pressure and tachycardia.,F,26,5  days,2/5/2008,Zyrtec

He had then developed behavioral problems and has had them on and off since.  After being off zyrtec for a couple of months now his behavior has turned around.  Today he woke up stuffy and naturally I gave him zyrtec.  Horrible day at school.  Outbursts and aggressive.  I couldn't put my finger on what was different about today except the zyrtec and when I found this site and all I have read I am horrified.

1102, 1, allergy control for allergy asthma,I started taking the Zyrtec in December_ and within 60 days gained 20 pounds.  I was told I had simply reached 'that age'.  While taking the Zyrtec non-stop over the year - the weight continued to add on at about 1 pound per month after I was told that Zyrtec could increase appetite.  So - the increase continued even though I was re-doubling my efforts to change.  Prior to taking this medication_ I have NEVER had any problems with weight...EVER.  And since taking it_ even life-style changes in diet and exercise have had no impact.  I find that shocking for someone who NEVER exercised to be able to get nothing out of it at all.  It's counter intuitive_ to say the least.  I also experienced other side effects_ which may also have resulted from the weight gain - I sweat ALL the time.  I never used to sweat very much at all.,It was only partially effective in keeping my sinuses drained.  I took it religiously as sinus infection preventative_ and I still ended up with an infection at my usual time of year - the following winter.  The infection cleared up more readily without antibiotic and it kept things flowing and prevented the facial pain.  But_ overall_ especially with the side effects_ I wouldn't consider this any better than any OTC sinus drainage drug that could be started AFTER the sinus infection sets in.,F,38,460  days,1/29/2008,Zyrtec

1104, 2, Allergies,My son had been taking the Zyrtec 10 mg chewable for about 2 years.  We recently switched to the liquid about three months ago.  We have noticed some severe behavioral problems.  He is extremely disagreeable_ very moody_ has outbursts daily and often seems very angry. He almost seems depressed.  Often just minutes after an episode he will have a very calm and apologetic attitude.  He has always been recognized by his teachers and other adults for his good behavior in the past.  He has not been sleeping through the night.  He's extremely tired in the morning and talks of very vivid dreams or even nightmares.  He's also having great difficulty focusing both at home and at school. I was in the process of having him tested for ADD before learning that many children on Zyrtec are experiencing the same symptoms.  It seemed to worsen these past few months when we switched to the liquid formula.  Not sure if there is a connection.  We have immediately removed him from the drug.,,M,8,2  days,1/21/2008,Zyrtec

Immediately began the uncontrolled eating_ weight gain (20 pounds and its only December 31_ 2007) and lethargy. I have been taking an antidepressant for about 20 years with up and down results and thought I was in another down episode and/or some hormonal change.  My doctor thought I needed something to help with concentration and prescribed metadate.  I took it for about a month.  The lethargy went away but not the excessive eating.  So I stopped taking the metadate. I saw my doctor again and he suggested using a mantra at night to help with the obsessive thoughts.  Sorry_ no dice. I stopped taking vitamins the other day in hopes that would help with the excessive eating.  I also decided to stop the zyrtec.  Today is day 2.

I trust(ed) his pediatrician. I didn't notice any immediate change in his behavior and can't directly put my finger on when I got seriously concerned about it since initially he was given it intermittently.  However_ his allergies got so that it was almost constantly that he would have the sniffles and a runny nose_ so I finally started nightly doses.  I attributed his behavior initally just to a ""phase"".  This ""phase"" continued while I kept waiting for him to grow out of it.  My sister even suggested oppositional defiant disorder.  i was upset enough to ask his pediatrician about his behavior and after interacting with him early last month at his well-check she assured me he was fine while writing out a new Zyrtec prescription.  His behavior is much the same as other parents have reported:  instant a","So what happened??  I ran out about a month ago and had switched pharmacy plans and hadn't gotten around to taking care of the 3 mos. mail order supply.

Everyday since has been the same and I've been waiting on pins and needles for my ""old"" angry son to reappear.  A tiny light in my brain a couple of days ago asked if it could be a Zyrtec side effect and I finally googled tonight and here I am.

1169, 1, itching would cause bumps,After having contact dermatitis itching for a year_ I was amazed how it completely got rid of the skin irritation from my scalp to my feet. BUT_ the trade off was not worth it. I had trouble with any complex tasks. I had trouble doing routine things I do with no problem. I couldn't recall basic things that I should've been able. I slept all day_ seriously drowsey. I would rate it a 9 on a one to ten scale on how drowsey it made me. I soon began to ask why I was so unmotivated_ lazy_ sleepy_ completely introverted_ and with absolutely no energy. My co-workers were really taken and worried about my personality change. My competitors were overjoyed that I lost my motivation. I realized soon_ very soon_ that I would have to make a tough decision; stay on this stuff and turn into a mentally dumbed-down potato or go back to the itching and deal with it another way. I decided to go with the itching and get my life back. In my job_ not being creative_ energetic_ and sharp (money market broker),I have learned it's true what people say; that all-body itching can be a stress reaction. Just go ride a bike_ play an instrument_ talk to people. You'd be surprised how it helps. I think it's terrible how a zombie drug like this can go on the market. This drug will make you seriously dead to the world. All you want to do is sleep_ all day_ every day. You wouldn't believe how much I just slept through my days. How can a government allow it's citizens to become so zombie-like? I know several people that have the same thing I had_ they both say the increased histamine response is from stress. It's stress_ and should should be dealt with in a more healthy way_ not just by taking yet another pill that takes all your fun away. Keep your life_ ditch this drug.

She is now off the medication.  Yikes!",Now that I've read some entries on this site_ I see that she may have had other symptoms as well.

1178, 1, sinus/allergies,My seven year old daughter began taking Zyrtec daily in July.  She has suffered from sleeplessness_ extreme temper tantrums_ ODD like behavior (very defiant)_ crying over everything_ extreme hunger (even after eating).

I have experienced dry mouth and sleepiness_ but no less than I ever have with Benadryl.  The dry mouth can be pretty wicked at times_ I generally take it before bed because it does make me sleepy_ but I've actually found it to regulate my sleeping; I can now sleep a full 8 hours instead of my old 4-5 hours a night.

The regimen is singulair and rhinocort in the morning_ and zyrtec at night.  This has helped his allergies tremendously. Then he started waking up for no reason after going to bed_ feeling hot for little reason (once I thought it was from too much sun)_ and on numerous occasions_ crying for no reason.  Tonight I asked if he felt sad_ and he said_ ""Yes_ but I don't know why.""  Tomorrow_ we will go without Zyrtec. (He had taken Singulair on and off for over a year so the mood change is not from that.)  If he needs a nighttime antihistamine_ I will give him what I have taken for 44 years:  chlor pheniramine maleate_ aka Chlor Trimeton.  The only side-effect I've ever had is drowsiness.  BTW_ I attribute the biggest improvement in my own allergies (shots since age 5) to nasal spray (Rhinocort).  None of the new antihistamines do as well as the classic old ones (Benedryl and Chlor Trimeton) but most of the new ones don't make one drowsy.",M,8,3  weeks,8/16/2007,Zyrtec

At night_ the stinging itch gets so bad that I feel like there are bugs crawling all over me; I truly start to go crazy. The itch was so bad_ I kept going back on the Zyrtec. Under the direction of a concerned allergist (who had never heard of this type of withdrawal before)I have been trying to wean myself off of it by lengthening the days between taking Zyrtec_ and using over-the-counter Benedryl to curb some of the itching.

(The first day of half a dose was rather unpleasant for my sinuses_ but the rest of the week was fine.)  So the next week_ I quit Zyrtec altogether.  The first day was again unpleasant for my sinuses_ but by the second day my sinuses were fine.  (I was doing the Neti Pot 3 times a dayat this point_ planning on weaning myself to 2 times a day once my body was used to not taking Zyrtec.)  But the next day_ I broke out in hives.

He talked about hearing voices in his head telling him to do bad things.  He talked about having dreams during class.  And the nightmares were very vivid. My son always has been such a happy go lucky kid_ his sudden dark mood swings and aggressive behavior were really out of character.  If he were older I would have been looking for some sort of substance abuse issue.

I went to www.drmagaziner.com and they were able to find the cause and the cure so I didn't need Zyrtec.

While I have not experienced a tolerance to the med_ I have_ over all of these years_ been treated for almost ALL of the side effects listed in this forum (significant weight gain despite high activity_ depression_ sedation_ etc.). Until recently_ I was on 2 antidepressants simultaneously (Wellbutrin XL and Lexapro).The thing that is freaking me out is that on 2 occasions that I have stopped taking it_ I experienced WITHDRAWAL SYPTOMS like I would expect from going off of a narcotic (abdominal cramping_ diarrhea_ fatigue). This is my final attempt and I am weaning myself off of it (Zyrtec every 3rd day and taking Claritin on the off days). Pharmacists assured me there was no such thing as withdrawal from Zyrtec.

It would take me a good half hour to be able to open my eyes and just get out of bed_ then I'd spend the whole day feeling groggy. I thought that it could be the medication_ so I stopped taking it for a week. Within 3 days off of it_ I started returning to completely normal. I thought that a great way to see if it truly was the zyrtec or not would be to try it one more time. All it took was one dose and my stomach is killing me and I could not wake up this morning for anything. It is 1:30pm and I am just starting to feel awake_ however I'm still disoriented.,When I called my doctor's office to explain what I've been experiencing_ they fluffed me off telling me that the side effects I complain about are not side effects of this medicine.

Allegra_ Claritin_ Sudafed_ Nasacort by themselves all did not work.  After reading an article and the comments on this board on Zyrtec and weight gain_ I am VERY suspicious that Zyrtec caused me to gain about 2 lbs per month_ over 20+ lbs in 3 years.  Most of the weight gain is in the stomach and_ to a lesser extent_ in the face_ upper back_ and thighs.  I am normally skinny-to-average in size.  Recently_ I noticed that when I went off Zyrtec for 3 weeks_ I lost 5-6 lbs.  When I went back on Zyrtec_ I gained 8 lbs in 5 months.  I admit I sometimes eat over my caloric count to lose weight of 1_200 calories a day.  But I exercise 2-6 times a week for about 45 minutes each.  So the 20-lb weight gain seems too severe.

Anyway - Zyrtec is the only drug I've found that allows me to be symptom free during the height of spring and fall allergy seasons.

1258, 2, year round allergies,My 7 year old has been on Zyrtec for 4 months. What I had started to think of as behavioral problems might very well be attributed to this drug....He has become angry_ depressed_ out of control_ incredibly aggressive and argumentative.  I did not know people were having these kinds of side effects so I would never have suspected his behavior and nightmares could be caused by this so called miracle drug. Also_ these behaviors did not appear immediately upon starting Zyrtec_ it has been more of a steady increase and intensity of symptoms. I read parts of this site last night and decided not to give him his dose. He used Claritin instead--it actually dried up his eyes_ something zyrtec had failed to do.,"I was not 100% satisfied with zyrtec even before I found out about all of these other unexpected possible side effects.

1259, 1, Allergies,My 8 yr old son was on zyrtec for about a week for allergies but when the allergies eased up i stopped the zyrtec because i figure why take meds when you dont need them. Anyways his allergies are acting up again and so are his sisters so the doc told me yesterday to give her the zyrtec now also. For some reason I had a hunch to look it up on the internet and I came across this site..OH MY GOODNESS I am so thankful I found this page. Needless to say the Zyrtec went bye-byes and they both had benadryl before they went to bed last night. I will NOT give my kids zyrtec if the side effects are that bad. I had no clue because my son had only taken it for a week before i took him off it the first time. I wouldnt have noticed any side effects in that short amount of time.. THANK you to everyone on here for sharing your horrible stories. Now my kids wont have to go through hell!,,F,33,7  days,4/26/2007Email,Zyrtec
1260, 3, Seasonal Allergies,My 6yr old daughter had problems last spring with vaginal irritation and discomfort when urinating.  We took her to the pediatrician 3 x's and a Gyn and they came up with nothing.  This spring_ same problem - went online and found this site stating some females had similar problems w/Claritan.  I called Pfizer this morning and they told me that skin irritation is side effect of med(which they included her problem as part of that side effect).  Incidentally_ 4 yr old son had strange rash on face after starting Zyrtec_ maybe is related to med as well?,"My daughter has terrible allergies_ don't know what to do to relieve suffering - she missed several days of school last year due to vaginal irritation - not to mention Dr's asking her if anyone ""touched"" her.

I also have a corneal disease and so was wondering that something had changed with my corneas.  I am relieved to learn that this possibly just due to the antihistamine.  I am going to try going off it now to see if that helps_ although it does seem to help with the allergies.

I was also put on Nasonex twice a day. I stopped the Zyrtec 2 days ago until I read these blogs and realized what the issue was. I had to wean myself off of it and did not due to the BAD headache and frustration.

About a year and a half ago we took him to an allergist and he was tested and prescribed Zyrtec to treat his symptoms. He has been on and off of this since.About a 2 weeks ago he began to have allergy symptoms. So I administered the Zyrtec.  About a week or so after that I noticed that he began to move his neck_ clear his throat often_ blink plenty and shrug his shoulders involuntarily.  When I took him to his pediatrician she freaked me out by likening his symptom to a child with Tourettes said that they were repetitive tics and referred us to a neurologist. I lost my mind_ but it wasn't until I began to read these ratings and came across one that talked about the involuntary tics that I made the connection and did some more research on the medication.,"Do not let your pediatrician diagnose your child with a trumped up biased observation and call it ""tourettes"" when in actuality it may only be the medicine. This scared my husband and I to death.",M,4,8  times,4/18/2007,Zyrtec

My Dr. put me on Zyrtec and told me to see an allergist. The allergist said I didn't need to be on it every day_ just the days I break out (which has been once every 4-5 mo.) I am now off Zyrtec (for one week) and am itching like crazy. My scalp itches_ if I sit on my leg or put pressure on my arms they get hot itchy spots. I called the pharm. and she said it is not a withdrawal from zyrtec that the medicine must have been hiding some other illness. (Which from reading these posts I don't believe) I have called the first Dr. and his secretary told me the same as the pharm.  I am now waiting on a call back from my allergist. I just wondered if anyone knows how long this itchiness spell will last. I assume since the zyrtec has been blocking all histamines for the last three months that my body is not used to them now.

1277, 2, seasonal allergies,To all parents of young children--my 6 year old experienced the SAME behavior problems on Zyrtec.  I contacted his allergist today_ and he said Zyrtec crosses the blood-brain barrier (as do most anithistimines)_ and therefore could defintely cause behavioral changes.  His allergist prescribed Allegra for children (which is NEW spring 2007)_ and Allegra DOES NOT CROSS THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER!!!  Will start this in a few days with my son...hopefully will work!

She said that if she didn't know him from the previous 7 months in her class (when he wasn't on Zyrtec)_ that she would have thought that was just the way he was.  I did not make the connection_ and so the poor kid spent 3 months screaming at school.  The end of summer came_ and I took him off his allergy meds.

We recently started up again (been about 2-3 weeks now).  She has been completely irrational and out of control emotionally.  Extreme meltdowns at the least bit of disappointment.  As many parents before me have mentioned_ my child acted as if possessed.  We too had started checking into psych coucil thinking that something had to be going on with her.  She experienced extreme rage that was scary to us.  If we would start to ask her to do something like put her bike away etc she would start screaming I know I know I am a bad girl and you hate me and on and on and on.  There was no consoling her.  She also developed what has appeared to be an involuntary tic with what started as rapid blinking of her eyes.  Now she appears to be winking rotating from eye to eye.  I just today found that numerous studies have shown that a rare side effect is orofacial dyskenesia which is invol,Has not adequately been proven safe for children.

1280, 1, Allergies,I can't believe that I am not the only one who has experienced this.  This is both reassuring and disconcerting at the same time.  I actually got very emotional when I started to read all of the comments_ especially_ those parents with 4-5 year olds taking these meds.  My 4-year-old daughter has been taking Zyrtec for the past four months.  A wonderfully sweet child transformed into this terribly-aggressive and noncompliant pre-schooler.  Further_ she became extremely emotional_ aggressive towards me_ my wife_ and her brother_ and catatonic at times.  She started tantrums_ talking to herself_ destroying her toys and her room.  In fact_ she started a new daycare two weeks ago because she was dismissed from her previous pre-school because of uncontrollability.  We immediately dismissed the notion that our daughter should be tested for ADHD.  I feel so bad for our daughter because we also have taken so much from our daughter in attempts to correct her behavior -- toys_ early bed_ no snack,I agree with others that this information needs to be more readily available.  My wife and I have had many sleepless nights worrying about our daughter.  We really have to find a way to get this information out to others!!!,F,4,4  months,4/9/2007Email,Zyrtec
1281, 1, allergies,My daughter has allergies and was prescribed zyrtec to replace claritin after having pneumonia twice in two months. I was told to give her the Zyrtec at night because it can cause drowsiness. I usually did that but occasionally when someone else would keep her overnight_ they'd forget and give it to her in the morning. Her behavior was terrible -- aggressive and unpredictable and she's usually very sweet. I couldn't rule out the fact that she was with someone else when this happened. For the last two weeks_ I ended up giving her the Zyrtec in the morning because we forgot one night and just got off track. My daughter's behavior has been awful -- to the point where her teacher even asked if she was taking something that might make her behave so differently. I decided to see if I could find some link between aggression/irritability in young children and zyrtec. I am so grateful to have found this site.

Frankly I have to stop because I need to breathe.Antihistamines in general seem to make people pack on pounds. I know very few habitual hayfever sufferers.Threshold itchiness - it can feel like you're about to get hives all the time_ but you never do. It feels like electricity to some people I've talked to.Lethargy - While I don't feel tired_ I notice that my day ends considerably sooner than it did before I started taking Zyrtec. My already considerably short attention span is even shorter_ and I find that my attention to detail is easily side tracked_ and end up doing stupid things of little use or consequence.Ironically_ I fall asleep as soon as I take Zyrtec at night_ but find myself staring at the ceiling with my mind racing,I started taking this because everything I ate was causing me to break out in hives and fall asleep. Zyrtec stopped that enough so that I could function during the day_ but the beneficial effects are wearing off now. I'm tired again after I eat and am beginning to get itchier.After ceasing Zyrtec for a few days_ I've noticed that I feel pretty itchy all the time_ so I try not to scratch. I am wondering if this particular antihistamine might have been blocking some itchiness it would have been better to be aware of. In fooling the body into not reacting for some things_ it may fool the body into not reacting for important things - like yeast infections. This is not good.Frankly_ I don't think this should be given to children. It seems to make me not care about some important things.

AGGHHH!!!!,For its intended purpose_ this is the BEST antihistimine I have ever taken_ started on Clartin_ progressed to Allegra180_ and now Zyrtec 5-10mg/day.  It wipes out the itch in my eyes_ post nasal drip I thought I would drown in_ sinus pain and pressure and_ also got rid of a 'big ball of fur' type of feeling in the back of my throat (probably irritation from Post nasal drip..).   The weight gain is horrible_ after losing 135 pounds and keeping it off for 5 years (before starting Zyrtec)_ to gain this much weight is VERY troubling to me_ I have tried to get off of Zyrtec and wind up with horrible sinus headaches_ so maybe some day I can wean slowly off of it.....!!  Some day SOON,F,37,1  years,3/17/2007,Zyrtec
1298, 5, Recuring Hives - unknown allergy,Occasional drowsiness.,"1 pill/day 10mg taken in the morning.  I have been very pleased with Zyrtec's ability to keep the hives away.  I still get redness and hot patches (skin gets very hot to touch) where the ""itchy hives"" would have been. When the Zyrtec starts wearing off_ the ""itchy hives"" come back.  Occassionally_ the hives falre up badly and I have to take an extra Zyrtec and a few times had to dose way up on Benedryl. Benedryl seems to help far better during severe cases when I get a snout full of whatever my allergin is.  Zyrtec is not a cure.  It is a suppressant.",M,36,9  months,3/17/2007,Zyrtec
1299, 2, severe allergies/sinuses,Totally lethargic - I could not get through the day without having to take a two hour nap; decreased sex drive; increased irritability,Not worth all the added side effects- I'll stick with Claritin,F,24,2  months,3/16/2007,Zyrtec
1300, 2, Allergies,Significant weight gain.  Went from 145 when I started taking it to almost 170 when I stopped.  This was over a 1 1/2 span of taking the medication.,It worked great for my allergies.  I slept better and had increased energy.  But I could not lose the weight.  Went cold turkey in December 2006 and down 5 pounds since stopping.,M,28,1.5  years,3/12/2007,Zyrtec
1301, 3, itching,Forgetfullness_ tiredness_ brain fog_ headaches_ Weight gain,I have been taking zyrtec for over 2 years_ nearly everyday.  On several occasions I have tried to give this up_ but by the 3rd day my itching becomes so severe that I am almost in tears.  So back I go to Zyrtec.  I have put on over 30 pounds in the 2 years_ partly due to lifestyle but also_ I feel_ due to long term use of this drug.  It's as if my metabolism has completely slowed down.  I also walk about in a semi-daze for most of the day and find socialising is difficult as I am too tired to enjoy any event! Yes_ Zyrtec works better than any other drugs I have taken in the same class.  However_ doctors have told me there 'should' be no side affects from taking this drug long term_ but alas_ I truly believe there are!!  However_ to stop all together is equally as frightening as the itching seems to come back much more than before....,F,44,2  days,3/11/2007,Zyrtec
1302, 1, hives_ itching_ seasonal allergies,While I was on zrytec my appetite increased a lot. I gained over 20 pounds even though I exercised 5 days a week.  I had always been very athletic and skinny and I am careful with my diet.  Even on very healthy meals and with high levels of excercise I gained tremendous weight.  I looked swollen and bloated.  I also had high blood pressure and during doses I would get severe itching making me think I needed the zyrtec to stop the itching.  I did not think it could have been the zyrtec that was causing or exacerbating it.  I was always tired and sleepy.  My mind seemed foggy.  I thought these were symptoms of my allergies and that zyrtec was helping.  Quite the contrary_ zyrtec was in fact the culprit!,I came off zyrtec 7 months ago.  I told everyone that I would write back if coming off helped.  IT DID!  The severe itching went away_ my weight dropped off me almost immediately.  My high blood pressure returned to normal. Clarity came back.  Looking back on the experience_ I could not believe that zyrtec could cause so much damage.  No amount of exercise or diet would have prevented or reduced the tremendous weight gain.  The other side effects (itching_ feeling dreamy_ sleepy) were due to zyrtec.  As allergy sufferers we do not need these extra complications.  Those symptoms are so close to your allergy symptoms you may not even realize they are side effects of the medication you are taking.  Zyrtec is a dangerous drug.  Ask your doctor to switch to something else.  The relief from seasonal allergies is NOT WORTH the side effects of zyrtec. It should be taken off the market.  It is a dangerous drug.,F,31,8  months,3/11/2007,Zyrtec
1303, 5, Allergies/post nasal drip,Zyrtec makes me a little tired_ but I take it before bed and have no complaints.,I suffered from year round allergies which caused post nasal drip that lead to severe sore throats and swollen glands.  Since taking Zyrtec I rarely experience sore throats and feel that my immune system is stronger since I no longer have to constantly fight with my allergies.  I am also VERY sensitive to most meds and experience the full range of side effects_ but not from this drug.,F,27,2  years,3/7/2007,Zyrtec
1304, 1, Allergies,Irritability_ aggressive behavior_ loss of appetite. After a couple of days on the drug_ we had to take our son in for extreme drunk-like behavior. He walked around with a limp all day and was slurring his speech. At the time_ I was thinking the worst_ like a brain tumor or something. At the recommendation of his pediatrician_ we took him off it for two days then started him back on it at half the original dose. He was walking and talking better_ but we still definitely noticed increased irritability and moodiness_ as well as having problems getting along with his friends_ and he would cry at the drop of a hat. I felt like I was always disciplining him over his behavior_ when all along it was the effects of this drug. Then we took him off it completely for about 3 days_ and he got a rash all over his body_ but his temperment was back to normal--we got our sweet_ calm son back!,DO NOT PUT YOUR CHILDREN ON THIS DRUG!!!,M,3,1  days,3/5/2007,Zyrtec
1305, 4, Itching / hives,"Mild sleepiness and not safe to drive for at least about 4 hours after taking it.  While I may seem alert_ my brain can just ""malfunction"" and cause me to run off the road.",While Zyrtec can cause some sleepiness_ it is an angel compared to Ararax and Vistaril.  In fact_ 4 10mg pills a day (40 mg/day) of Zyrtec is MUCH less sedating than even 10-20 mg of Atarax_ and has not led to near as many mistakes and memory loss.  I found Zyrtec to be the most powerful drug that I've tried for hives_ that doesn't screw up my brain royally.  For my hives_ it is proven to be 24-25 times as powerful as Allegra_ milligram per milligram_ and about 2-3 times as powerful as Claritin.  If Zyrtec and Claritin together can't control my hives and itching_ even when coupled with Zantac_ an H2 blocker_ I'll probably have to go back to the old and HEAVILY SEDATING crap_ like Atarax.

1306, 3, allergies,Another story about the itching when you try to get off it: when I told my allergist I was experiencing itching_ he insisted it means I have exema and the zyrtec has been suppressing it (I have never had a sign of exema). Could he really not know it's a problem?,,F,43,3  years,2/26/2007,Zyrtec
1307, 1, ALLERGIES,reduced inching yes. Instigated ASTHMA attacks.  did not help cat allergy!i am allergic to dust mites_ oak_ pine_ ragweed_ and cats. but ESPECIALLY CATS!! (that is really the entire reason i need an antihistamine),I had been taking Allegra (and the generic) for about 9 years prior (claratin gave me dry mouth_ drowsiness_ and headaches).  Allegra is GREAT!!!Zyrtec gave me no relief from my cat allergies_ and actually induced an asthma attack. (I do not get asthma attacks often_ maybe once every year or two) And after taking this I noticed it but thought that it was silly to think a pill could give me one.  SO I took it two more times (in the presence of allergens of course) and sure enough both times I got an asthma attack that rapidly worsened - which is bad for someone with such rare asthma cause they don't carry an inhaler with them.,F,23,3  days,2/23/2007,Zyrtec
1308, 4, Nose and Eye allergies to pets,Iam tired if i take this medication in the morning.. So i take it at night. Sometimes i think its making me feel a little depressed or irritable.

1309, 1, Hives,Strong food cravings which caused weight gain_ digestive problems and fatigue.,I do not recommend Zyrtec. I got stomach cramps and diarrhea. I had strong food cravings and therefore gained a lot of weight within only two weeks. I was also really tired during the day and had to take hour-long naps. I started taking Zyrtec together with Prednisone. After I stopped the Prednisone the side effects did not stop and acually got worse_ plus the hives came back. After I stopped taking Zyrtec the sympoms dissappeared_ but the hives were better than before I started taking any medication. My experience was that the hives were stress related and it has gotten a lot better since I accepted having the hives and do not have so much stress anymore.,F,19,2  weeks,2/13/2007,Zyrtec
1310, 1, seasonal allergies,incredible fatigue_ inability to wake up in the morning_ immediate weight gain,seems to work well for allergies_ but side effects are dramatic. I was given 2 weeks of samples before getting a prescription filled. was finally able to sleep well at night (was on Allegra-D for 6 months prior and had difficulty sleeping more than 3 hrs at a time). However now i'm sleeping 10-12 hours and groggy and yawning all day long. Physically exhausted_ not interested in exercise. In 2 weeks have gained enough weight so my pants no longer fit. I'd hate to see how much I would gain if I stayed on it.,M,39,15  days,2/9/2007,Zyrtec
1311, 1, Sinus Headaches,Heart beat is too strong and fast. Tired and Sleepy. I have been hungry all day. Just two days on this medicine and I already know I can't take it. Ringing in my ears. High pitch noises make me cringe.,Not worth taking it. There has got to be a better way to get rid of these sinus headaches!,F,46,2  days,2/7/2007,Zyrtec
1312, 5, Chronic allergies,The itching!!! As with others reported here_ about 2-3 days without Zyrtec the itching starts.  I thought I was nuts.  After several times of purposely going off the medication_ it was confirmed.  The itching started and was unbearable.,I do get tremendous allergy relief_ but I'm amazed nothing has been done to address the itching withdrawal condition.  I take no other medications.,F,41,2  years,2/6/2007,Zyrtec
1313, 2, Severe Allergies,Extreme tiredness. Inability to wake up in the morning regardless of amount of sleep the night before. Horrible withdrawal like symptoms whenever I attempt to stop taking the pills. Weight gain due to never feeling full.,I have been taking Zyrtec off and on for 5 years(only in the winter)_ but I've gotten the end of the road. I have fought the constant tiredness_ inability to wake up_ and irritability_ but can't anymore. I have been on every allergy drug out there_ Claritin_ alevert_ allegra_ Hismanal_ tavist_ flomax_ cingular_ rhinocort_ etc... and Rhinocort and Zyrtec are the only ones that really work for me. During the winter_ Rhinocort Aqua dries out my nasal passages too much giving me horrible nose bleeds_ forcing me to use the Zyrtec. But I can't take the side affects anymore. Inability to wake up regardless of how much sleep I've gotten is the worst. I am a morning person three quarters of the year_ until I take Zyrtec... Then I can't get out of bed. I am right now dealing with the nausea and headaches from the withdrawal I deal with every year when I discontinue use. To be honest the 4 to 5 day withdrawal going cold turkey is so bad that I generally wean myself off the drug. One every other d,M,26,5  years,2/6/2007Email,Zyrtec

When took him off of Zyrtec noticed a significant difference in his behavior.  Switched allergy/pulmonolgist drs and he said not to give it to him.  His behavior over all has improved drastically.

It's done wonders for me.  I got hives and was prescribed it and it took them away.  I'm weaning myself to taking it once a day_ at supper_ every 3 days.

He can't sit still_ he can't focus on the classwork. His teacher suggested me to talk to the doctor because his behavior just like ADD_ I made a research and found this website_I was so shock that Zyrtec will affect the child's behavior so much. I decided to reduce the  medicine week by week_ now my kid was very good in the school_ he remember everything_ He completed every sigle classwork/homework.I really think all of the doctors should give the parents warming  before the children starts taking ZYRTEC.

That was the least of our problems.  Our son was aggressive_ moody_ tired_ I could go on forever!!!  Jake was in preschool and having a difficult time focusing_ getting along with others_ and the teacher started to get concerned as well.  I am a teacher and was going to ask the peds. for a full scale evalution_ due to his behavior.  To make a long story short_ we had to find a new allergy dr_ and he had us stop giving Jake the meds for his upcoming allergy tests.  Within a few days we got our son back.  He doesn't have the outbursts and other behaviors_ Jake is  that happy child he once was.  We are grateful to have our son back_ however_ we feel cheated out of 2 years of his childhood.

Mondo-Headache-Zilla!,I'm concerned that after 4 months I think I'm totally addicted to this drug because I go thru serious withdrawal if I miss a dose just for one day & I don't know if I really want to take this for the rest of my life. It does make me feel better_ I get the best sleep of my life because it knocks me out_ but it's so hard to get going in the morning. I find I need at least nine hours of sleep when I take it.

My sweet girl became a moody_ argumentative_ mean girl.  It was scary.,I stopped the zyrtec immediately after reading about similar side effects on this web site - thank you for making the connection for me.

I have alway been in good health otherwise and take allergy shots for 1+ year as well. I tried the reflux otc drugs for my stomach with minimal improvement.  I have been to the doctor about these problems with no answers yet. I now wonder if this may be a growing side effect from my years of zyrtec use. I take 10mg before bed. It works like a sleeping pill for me and I am use to the lower energy level. After reading many of the posts here. I believe it's time to get off this drug for several weeks and see what happens. I will post again with any results of my test.     ,This drug really does help stop post nasal drip problems better than any of the drugs that I have tried over the years. But it can dry you out to much and cause an accute sinus sensitivity and if compounded with a flonese spray can become what appears as a very painful sinus infection without any real virus involved. Doctors give you antibotics which have no effect. I learned that nitetime room humidity at(50%+) and nasal washes finally stopped this problem.,M,54,10  years,1/9/2007,Zyrtec

1337, 5, Pollens_ Cats_ Dogs_ Molds_ etc...,After reading through some of the responses I wonder if my side effects are greater than I had originally thought. I take a 10mg in the morning_ usually with my coffee. I can be quite irratable during the day_ but not always. At night if I sit down after work it's all I can do to stay awake. I have had significant weight gain. I think I might also be suffering from seriously dry sinuses. When I blow my nose it can be kind of bloody.,Despite these side effects I have nothing but praise for this drug. It is my miracle cure. My allergies and asthma are pretty severe throughout most of the year. Now taking Zyrtec and Advair. With the combination of these two I am virtually symptom free. I still sneeze occasionally but nothing like I used to. I also haven't missed any more work because of an allergy/asthma attack. Now as long as this drug doesn't lose it's potency I'll be happy!,M,33,1  years,12/30/2006,Zyrtec

1340, 1, Allergies,"My daughter was given this for her allergies and congestion. Her behavior was ""off the charts"" crazy. I became so afraid of the way she was acting last night that I almost called the after hours emergency line. She was very jittery and thirsty but mostly just very strange_ agressive_ angry behavior. She was throwing stuff_ yelling_ screaming_ mumbling strange things to herself. It was like she suddenly became another child. It was very scary. I couldn't get her to go to sleep despite the fact that she had skipped her nap and she was exhausted. She is still in bed this morning after finally falling asleep around midnight. Hoping she will be back to herself when she gets up... we will certainly not be using this again for her allergies. That was horrifying.",I personally take Zyrtec for my allergies and it works great for me. Little or no side effects and really drys up my congestion. I cannot believe the difference in side effects for children taking this medication. I have two other friends who also give this to their children regulary (and have done so for years) and do not experience these same effects. So I personally think that it can vary quite a bit from child to child. I personally will not give it to my daughter again.,F,3,1  days,12/21/2006,Zyrtec
1341, 1, Allergies,At first_ extreme increase in hunger; could only think about food!  Later_ abject depression_ total loss of self-worth_ crying spells_ loss of motivation.  When I stopped taking it_ I developed a hypersensitivity to any antihistamine that caused extreme anxiety.,This drug literally ruined_ and is still ruining_ months of my life.  I am now on Clonazepam and Abilify and still severely depressed; I can't seem to enjoy any of the things I used to and all I want to do is lie in bed.  My sense of self-worth is still gone and everything seems hopeless.  I used to be a very cheerful_ positive_ roll-with-the-punches sort of person_ and now she has been replaced by a humorless wreck.  I'm amazed that an antihistamine could do this_ and that given the number of similar stories here_ that the drug company denies that it could cause these problems.  Obviously_ it does_ and more warning should be given to patients about the potential disaster this drug can make of your life.  I so wish I could go back in time and never put this horrible substance into my system.,F,29,2  months,12/20/2006,Zyrtec

1343, 2, Allergies,Aggressive behavior_ disorganized thinking_ increased anxiety.  When my son stopped taking it he developed hive like spots all over his back_ which lasted for about 10 days.,Our son is diagnosed with a mood disorder_ so at first we did not recognize that he was having a negative reaction to zyrtec. In retrospect we now realize that completely destabilized while taking this drug.  Fortunately_ the damage was not permanent though it took him about about two weeks without zyrtec to return to his prior state.  The manufacturer appears to be aware that this type of reaction can occur.  If you look at page 11 of the 14 page document issued by the manufacturer Pfizer you will see a list of psychiatric symptoms associated with this drug.  The company states that zyrtec is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier and affect mental functions.  This may be true but it appears to me that the drug affects the body's biochemistry in some other way that does extend to the brain.  Bottom Line: NO ONE WITH A MOOD DISORDER SHOULD TAKE THIS DRUG.  It may destabilize a person to such an extent that serious harm could occur.,M,7,4  months,12/16/2006Email,Zyrtec

After six weeks I was so fatigued that I could barely work_ and at that point I started my own research online.  I found a few accounts similar to my own_ and I took myself off the Zyrtec.

1378, 2, Sinus and throat allergies,TERRIBLE WITHDRAWAL - If I ever missed a dose (36+ hours)_ I experienced terrible itching.  My solution was always to take another dose.  Before long I was not taking the Zyrtec for my allergies_ but rather to prevent the itching.  I was told by a counselor friend of mine that it sounded like I was experiencing withdrawal.  I researched_ found this site_ and have read that others have experienced similar withdrawal symptoms.  I quit taking Zyrtec cold turkey and am experiencing frequent fits of INTENSE itching all over my body.  I'm told that this should last about two weeks.  So far it's one of the worst things I've ever experienced.  A typical itching episode lasts from 45 minutes to 2 hours (of nonstop scratching)!  I then usually get 30 minutes to an hour of no itching before it starts back up.,I gave a rating of 2 because I'm not satisfied with the withdrawal symptoms.  However_ when I first began taking Zyrtec_ it relieved my sinus and throat allergies wonderfully.  But all the allergy relief in the world is not worth what I'm going through.  I would stay far_ far away from Zyrtec.,M,30,3  years,9/3/2006Email,Zyrtec

Significantly greater effects with the normal 10 mg dose.,I only use Zyrtec on an as needed basis about once per week most of the year and two to four times per week during the spring pollen season. A 5 mg dose works great for controlling my allergy symptoms.

I even changed everything in my house that I was using to see maybe I developed an allergy to something. no immune problems either. I tried a couple of different meds and nothing worked. my hives were severe. They would start around my joints move to my hands and feet and wrist_ then move to the rest of my body_ even in my throat_ my face and me eyes would itch.

1389, 1, Suspected allergies,My almost-2 year old daughter started taking zyrtec because we thought that her coughing and sneezing was due to springtime allergies. Her personality totally changed on the zyrtec. She threw terrible tantrums_ was completely irrational and unhappy_ and became extremely moody. She would wake up at night screaming and crying and was very difficult to soothe. She became almost like a different person. Once I suspected the zyrtec was the root of the problem_ I took her off immediately (she was only on for about 4 days). Within 2 days_ she was back to her old self. I STRONGLY adivse parents who are prescribed zyrtec for their children to monitor them closely and look for behavioral changes. No one warned me about it and I am just so thankful that we realized it so quickly. My ped had no idea about the side effects (and I am not sure I was able to convince him of it).

1392, 1, Sinus Infection,I lost the ability to sweat during the summer of 2005.  It all started after I had a sinus infection. I was given a Z-Pack and Zyrtec-D_ which got rid of the sinus infection. However_ my feet began to itch shortly thereafter. I visited several doctors_  all of whom prescribed different antihistamines (Allegra_ Hydroxizine_ and Zyrtec) to treat the itching. After a while_ the itching spread_ and I eventually stopped sweating.   Instead of sweating_ my entire body was covered with a painful prickly sensation_ as if my skin were being pierced with thousands of pins.  The pain was most intense whenever I tried to exercise_ and I frequently broke out in hives.  Giving up all hope_ I stopped taking all antihistamines in October of 2005_ but the pain continued for several months thereafter.  At one point_ I was investigating the use of steroids to improve my condition.  After considering my options_ I decided to wait it out.  I am very,"I have done some research and discovered that in October 2005_ a medical journal published an article called ""Adverse Cutaneous Reactions of Systemic Antihistamines"" (Current Medicinal Chemistry - Anti-Inflammatory & Anti-Allergy Agents_ Volume 4_ Number 5_ October 2005_ pp. 521-529(9).  I would love to read this article. It seems the medical community is just beginning to realize that their prized antihistamines may be causing much of the trouble they are supposed to be curing. During the course of my affliction I consulted with three allergists_ and they all refused to consider that I was having an allergic reaction to a drug they so frequently prescribe (even when I suggested the possibility). I only wish one of them had advised me to stop taking everything_ rather than prescribing the alternative antihistamines which worsened my condition. It is my hope that my experience will assist those who have similar symptoms.",M,28,5  months,7/29/2006,Zyrtec

It has worked very well overall so far_ even controlling my allergies when the pollen is really bad. For about the first month and a half I was really exhausted_ but unlike Benadryl it doesn't make me totally out of it_ so I can deal with being somewhat exhausted now. But after gaining at least 15 pounds in the past three months (and I'm one of those people who can *never* gain weight)_ I decided to look it up online and discovered a lot of other people have been having the same problem.,F,21,3  months,7/18/2006Email,Zyrtec

I didn't suspect zyrtec because there was nothing...repeat NOTHING in the insert that said anything about weight gain...now I will see.  I will continue exercising and re-post if the weight has dropped.  Dry mouth_ high blood pressure_ feeling dreamy_ swollen and loss of concentration.,By the way_ I always felt I was in a dream.  AND my blood pressure was higher than usual.  I have stopped taking zyrtec now for only one day and my head feels clearer_ my body doesn't feel foreign and my dreamy state is evaporating.

After the second day I had small subdermal blisters similar to eczema on my feet and ankles that developed into hives. The itchiness was unbearable. I used cortizone cream and when I resumed the zyrtec the itchiness subsided. Recently I stopped taking the drug again and the itchiness returned. This time I did not use cortizone but restarted the zyrtec and again the itchiness subsided.,Great website! I'm glad to konw others have had this side effect.

He also started mother's day out at the same time_ would cry every day and continued this into the next year would not talk to the teachers or interact with the other children. He also was stuttering when he would talk with us at home. After talking with the school I found out how he was not responding to them at all. So I had him evaluated by a speech pathotoligst and the evaluation was to take 45 min. because he would not talk to them took 2 hrs. At this time he got a severe sinus infection and the Dr. put him on a antibodic for 14 days and took him off the zyrtec during this time he did not stutter and at the 2nd testing they did not pick up on the stuttering but did have him evaluated at the school and after watching his action in the class room suggested that I have him tested for selective mutism.

1428, 5, Severe Allergies,I have had a few of the symptoms but never connected the two.  Heart palpatations when under alot of stress_ some hair loss_ but since on multivitamins and DanActive has restored new hair growth_ some vision blurring on and off_ can not take at bedtime because I don't sleep well_ take in morning with my tea to prevent sleepiness - no other caffiene drinks during the day or night consumed_ only water_ milk and juices.,Been on zyrtec for about five years and during these past few years I have been able to eat foods I have been severely allergic to in strides.  I DO NOT recommend anyone doing this without the consult of your doctor_ my family says I am playing russian roulette here.  I am free of any allegy affects of all kinds.  I also exercise running_ jump on trampoline and swim.  I also use flonase nasil spray sometimes before I fly for my ears and when I think the zyrtec is not effective enough (very few days of this occurrance - three times a year average).  I am sure not everyone can have the pleasure of zyrtec working for them - but from what I read it seems to help the majority.  It could be possible the side effects are allegic reations to the medicine.  Not all allegies are hives_ eye & nose watery and ichy and shortness of breath_ it could be vomiting_ lethargy and bowel problems (IBS symptoms)as well.  I have experienced this from food allergies on many occassions.,F,45,5  years,5/9/2006,Zyrtec

Doctor recommends me to stop all herbs and zyrtec.,At first it did not work for me.  It took several months to really kick in_ weird I know.  I was taking 2 per day at first.  After a few years I found I could get by with 1 per day.  Now I have been off for 72 hours and so far so good.  I still have to give God the credit for healing me.,M,55,6  years,5/4/2006,Zyrtec

I don't like the idea of my child being on medication like this every day.  Anyway_ we started the Zyrtec and within a couple days_ our son turned into a nasty_ combative_ argumentative child.  My ordinarily calm husband and myself were at our wits' ends with him and were ready to consider therapy.  My husband wondered if it was the Zyrtec.  Then I remembered that when my son was little (and his older sister also)_ I could not give them cold medicine because it would turn them into little monsters.  I figured it was because they were sick. Anyway_ I stopped the Zyrtec several days ago and WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  Overnight_ he changed back into the son I know and love.

My doctor prescribed Zyrtec to me for allergies when I was 14_ and for years I've taken it daily without even stopping to consider whether it was worth it.

The youngest is a wonderful girl_ and she's generally cooperative and calm.

1473, 1, enviromental allergies,Mood swings_ aggressiveness_ tearful_ negative_ abdominal pain_ extreme loss of appetite,After 7 months of successful zyrtec use my 4 yr old began to exhibit changes in his mood/personality.  He was very negative_ at times aggressive and yet tearful_ emotionally unstable.  We thought it was a phase_ growing pains_ etc.  He began to complain of stomach pain and had no appetite.  He was on the verge of weight loss.  His grandmother questioned whether the Zyrtec was upsetting his stomach.  Prompted by her theory I searched the internet and found this site.  The comments here blew us away.  We stopped the Zyrtec immediately and the there was a dramatic change the following day.  We had our son back.  I have been told by our dr. that Zyrtec_ unlike Claritin_ crosses over to the CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM.  Please consult with your pediatrician about other options.  DO NOT ASSUME that your child is just going thru a phase.

I gained 75 lbs while taking Zyrtec_ fifty of them in the last 6 months. I suffered from severe intermittent urticaria (hives) for thirty years_ until my doctor put me on Zyrtec 10mg. every night before bedtime. When prescription runs out and it takes a couple of days to renew it_ hives return and are very severe. I suffer tingling in the hands and fingers_ and sometimes the wrists_ and dizziness_ with a buzzing sound I seem to hear in my head_ rather than as an outside auditory sound. It's like a bee buzzing quickly through my head. My feet swell without clinical rationale.,I became mildly depressed_ believing I was suffering some serious disease_ and perhaps actually at risk of dying. I asked my doctor if there were any side effects_ and he didn't suggest any. I didn't question the Zyrtec until I finally saw a commercial on television which listed drowsiness as a side effect. Bam! That was it. I hadn't realized it_ but the lethargy_ sleepiness_ drowsiness almost to the point of narcolepsy started about four months after beginning the regimen of Zyrtec. I was a nurse for thirty-seven years_ and didn't have the sense to even consider that Zyrtec might be the culprit_ since it worked so well against the Hives. When I began reading the comments of others here_ I began to cry uncontrollably. I may have found relief from Hives_ but Zyrtec has made my living Hell. I'm going off Zyrtec at once_ and will advise other users who have presented with similar possible side effects to stop taking Zyrtec_ and see their doctor at once.,M,61,1.5  years,2/14/2006Email,Zyrtec
1481, 1, Alergies,Our 7 year old son was having violent temper tantrums_ throwing things_ punching and hitting other family members. These tantrums would last up to an hour or more. He was unable to handle anything that didn't go his way. He was like a monster and we did not know what to do. I thought he was ADHD or ODD and we began threapy for him. THANK GOD I FOUND THIS WEBSITE! It never dawned us us it could be the Zyrtec. Neither his doctor or his therapist knew anything about the pschological side effects that Zyrtec can cause. After further research I found that the following pschological side effects were listed in Zyrtec's own studies *** ABNORMAL THINKING_ AGITATION_ AMNESIA_ ANXIETY_ LOWERED LIBITO_ DEPERSONALIZATION_ DEPRESSION_ EMOTIONAL LABILITY_ EUPHORIA_ IMPAIRED CONCENTRATION_ INSOMNIA_ NERVOUSNESS_ PARANOIA_ SLEEP DISORDERS *** Amazingly_ the doctor perscribed the medication and never warned us of this! Everyone should be aware of this and I can attest that children should not be taking,Needless to say we took our son off the Zyrtec as soon as I read the information on this website. It has been about three weeks and we have seen much improvement. I pray that there are no long term effects on our son. Any other parents' comments are welcome. Feel free to e-mail me.

He's back to being well behavied_ much more impulse control - I could go on and on.

1493, 1, Allergy,Our daughter started taking Zyrtec at 2.5 years of age.  We thought her terrible two's had kicked in_ and so we waited and waited as our little girl went from sweetness to an utter nightmare.  She would fly into violent rages at the slightest disappointment_ most disturbingly_ slamming her head into the floor/wall/anything as part of her tantrum.  She is severely speach delayed_ her speech was normal until about two then she stopped developing.  She rarely to never slept through the night_ we even resorted to putting her on Trazadone because we couldn't handle her staying up forever and then waking all night long.  It worked for a bit_ then she was back to her old pattern.  We got her into a therapist who said she had never seen anything so violent or strange.  She also would wake in the night and have tantrums and act as though she didn't know where she was.  She would go from normal to pyschotic in an instant and back again.,Reading the comments on this website about the pediatric effects of this drug and the apparent lack of information given to parents makes me want to vomit.  If this drug is responsible for the 2.5 years of hell we've had to go through as parents I am interested in bringing a lawsuit against the manufacturers.  Anyone else?

Go to WWW.FDA.GOV then down to LET US HEAR FROM YOU then to REPORT A PROBLEM WITH A PRODUCT.  It's very easy to complete and will only take a few minutes of your time.  It's important to let the FDA know what's going on.  MAYBE we can get something done.  Thank you!,,,, ,11/3/2005,Zyrtec

I took Claritin for a long time_ which changed my life. After awhile it stopped working as well_ and I've taken Allegra and then Zyrtec. Zyrtec works better than anything I've tried and I don't notice any side effects. However_ recently two doctors have told me I have to get off of Zyrtec and I'm wondering why. Maybe it's because the HMO doesn't like to pay for it.,,F,44,1  days,10/23/2005Email,Zyrtec

The first two days I was giddy with happiness because my sneezy_ itchy snotty_ miserable son had started waking up bright eyed and bushy-tailed.  Then I realized how much his behavior was changing.  His teacher started saying that he couldn't seem to control himself in class.  Couldn't make a decision during choice time...on and on.  She said it ""wasn't like him""  and wanted to know what was going on different.  He also started crying more often for no reason and having strange dreams.  And last_ but not least_ he started chasing and scaring our cat who he used to be so gentle and kind with.  When I asked the doctor about the side effects_ she was very blasse' about it.  After reading the other comments about Zyrtec and kids on this site...I will never give it to him again.  DO NOT GIVE YOUR CHILDREN ZYRTEC.  IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!!!",M,5,2  weeks,10/18/2005,Zyrtec

I thought it was the coffee.  Then I started getting very 'sad'.  I just cried all the time until one day I had a total emotional breakdown and couldn't even go into the gorcery store because I couldn't stop crying.  It dawned on me that I needed to research Zyrtec and I found this site.  I think it quite literally may have saved my life.

We took him off for 2 months over the summer_ we noticed how much more in control he was.  We just attributed this to that fact that we was a year older and more mature.  6 days ago we started him back on the Zyrtec and within 24 hours we saw a total deterioration of his mood and behavior.

Stopped taking Zyrtec for 1 day found that my Allergies were Severe after the last dose wore off. The sleepiness wore off though.....  Took 1 dose of Zyrtec and did not take singular was very sleepy_ allergies were not as severe when going off of singular since Zyrtec was in system but found that the combined use was the best and most effective for my Severe Allergies.,was tired of being tired.....Then I had an idea and tried.... eatting something_ taking dose of Zyrtec then going to bed.  When I woke up the next morning_ I was actually not sleepy like I was use to being after taking Zyrtec/Singular.  My nature is normally one where it takes a litte bit to wake up_ but now_ after a cup of coffe (strong when asthma is really bad) I function wonderfully through out the day.    I've been doing this nightly ritual of eatting a little something before bed_ take Zyrtech/Singular for at least 3.5 months and I've become a highly productive individual.  At work_ I'm actually now doing the work of 2 people and am able to keep my head on straight with no sleepiness so that I can work on complex things and multitask at the same time. I'm so excited that I can actually do my normal duties and then some_ while not being bothered with my servere allergy complicaitons.  I feel like I'm a normal person for once.

1534, 5, Enviromental & pet allergies,I was drowsy the first few weeks I took Zyrtec but that went away once my body adjusted to the medication.,I have suffered from year-round allergies & asthma most of my life. As I have gotten older_ my symptoms have worsened to include skin rashes and chronic sinus infections in addition to itchy eyes_ congestion_ and a sore throat. After allergy testing_ my Doctor recomended Zyrtec because it is better for pet allergies & skin reactions then other allergy meds. I take Zyrtec twice a day_ every day. I also take Singular every night for my asthma but it has a great side-effect of also helping with the allergies. During the spring and summer months_ I subliment the Zyrtec with Flonase which is working out great because it really helps my eyes and nose from going crazy when seasonal allergies are high. Although taking all these meds may sound expenisive_ I am probably saving money since I don't get sick as often and need to see the doctor or take time off of work.,F,25,3  years,8/20/2005,Zyrtec
1535, 1, allergies/congestion/ itching/rashe,Our 5 year old son has been on zyrtec off and on since 1 y/o.  His dose was increased to 10mg/day for worsening symptoms in the spring of 2005.  He started becoming increasingly angry_ irritable and anxious.  It got to the point that he wanted to hurt himself_ run away_ hurt us and he became a totally different person.  He would cry so hard and ask us why he was so angry.  Physicians told us that children with allergies tend to have behavior disorders.  He started counsiling_ we kept food diaries_ sleep diaries_ looked at everything he did to find a cause for his behavior.  Finally we found this web site and found all of the other children who are reacting the same way to zyrtec.  We took him off of his zyrtec and singulair immediately.  Within 3 days he was a different child.  You could see happiness in his eyes. He laughs again_ he can concentrate - before he couldn't sit still to play with cars or do a dot to dot.  Now he can.  The transformation is amazing.  Not one physician ever told us to watch for this potential side effect.  He lost almost a year of his life and maybe more because of this drug.  After two weeks he is back to his old self.  The little things that would set him off into a violent tantrum are now no big deal.  My goal now is to let as many people as possible to know about this side effect so that parents don't have to search like we did.  We have no doubt that he would have ended up in special ed or labled as the child with the behavior disorder.  I would be happy to talk to any concerned parent about what we went through.

I thought i was the only one who had extreme itching when off antihistamines.  i can't go off. I really think going off zyrtec is worse than the others.  i went off Allegra yrs ago for allergy testing and it was bad but bearable.  a yr ago after i had just started zyrtec_ i had to go off for 10 days to complete allergy testing_ well_ it was so bad i would cry everytime i had to take a shower or wash my hair_ it was bad.  and it didn't get better.  i do think your body changes after being on the antihistamine.  i rated it a 3 because i'm not sure about the side effects_ but it does help my allergies.,F,48,1  years,8/8/2005Email,Zyrtec

Outbursts of anger.I first took this drug when i was 15_ it worked well for awhile and i don't recall having fatigue as a side effect.  I do recall a lot of anger and depression to the point where the doctor wanted to treat me for it but i didn't want to take any more pills.  I thought i was depressed because of a broken ankle_ not my allergy pills_ maybe i was wrong.  At one point after returning from a doctors visit finding my ankle was still getting worse i threw my crutch like a javilin at the wall in my house making a large hole.  I never had those type of outbursts before Zyrtec. I got off zyrtec the following winter when i kept gettign sinus infections_ my depression problems vanished and i was normal again.  My ankle was healing and we attributed it to that.,Three weeks ago i had a bad sinus infection and i was leaving to Germany and the doctor gave me augmentin and i asked for a strong allergy medicine because my pollen and grass allergies can get bad in Bavaria.  I recieved Zyrtec the first couple of days i felt fine.  When i arrived in Germany (4 days after starting Zyrtec) i felt REALLY jet-lagged.  It never got better.

1548, 3, 9 month old taking for allergies,Drowsiness at first_ but now seems to make her irritable/agitated.,My daughter has been on Zyrtec since she was 7 months old for allergies. Nothing else would work. Benadryl caused her to break out in hives and made her wired_ she's also allergic to pseudoephedrine_ and Palgic doesn't seem to do anything at all.  At first_ it knocked her out at bedtime. She slept soundly through the night for the first few days. But since then_ she goes to bed and sleeps for about an hour_ and then she's up and down constantly. She also rolls and tumbles while she's sleeping. She seems so irritable and agitated.

It showed me fully congested in all sinuses(all areas gray).  I am now on strong antibiotic with saline nasal washes with afrin(5 days of afrin) and 14 days on Augmentum 1000 mg two at am and two at pm. Now I have decided to stay off of zyrtec and I have been itchy all over my body.  This happened to me another time I decided to stop for two days I was itchy all over all day long. After restarting I was ok.,I am not sure what happened since I've been on zyrtec for 3 years thinking it was helping me.  This itchiness has never been mentioned as a side effect for stopping the zyrtec. Are there many others experiencing this.  All I know is that I will never resume with zyrtec again_ knowing that I will be itchy if I stop.  It's not worth it.  I have to find something else???,F,54,3  days,6/13/2005Email,Zyrtec

I couldn't believe that my toddler was acting like this. That this medicine could actually change his behavior in such a way the it scared the crap out of me.

He is a gifted child and has never had any behavioral problems until being on zyrtec.

SCARY irregular hartbeats_ laziness_ cough_,I was given the perscription about 2 months ago for trial because of severy allergies at the start of pollen season. It worked great at first and still does. I just started to notice Im not myself all the time. I turned into evil kenivel on the highway and no logical sense while doing it. I go through mood swings that dip real low to the point of why not just end it now. I have never been or have i ever experienced such crazy thoughts. I keep gaining weight although I have no appetite.I don't even eat that much yet can't loose a pound. 175lbs. for reference. Was usually 165-170.

1567, 1, seasonal allergies,severe fatigue_ drowsiness_ dissociation or dream-like state_ flat effect,I took Claritin before but had no relief_ so I began Zyrtec a few years ago on and off. It'd work_ but my allergies weren't bad enough to be bothered. This year they're terrible_ and noticing Zyrtec is making me almost completely incapacitated. I take it before bed because it leaves me so tired_ but I wind up sleeping 10 hours and extremely tired the next day_ with a strange disconnected feeling. I've been told I seem to not know what's going on around me and have no emotional reactions like I normally do. It however_ does make my allergy symptoms go away_ but I'd advise anyone to stay far away from this especially if they find out of body/confusion experiences scary. (p.s.

I basically slept all weekend and was so exhausted that I was incapable of caring for my three young children.  I feel like I am in a fog.  I have also have zero patience with my husband or children for the past several days.  Then_ the itching on my face started!  It was only when I read this site that I realized my extreme overtiredness and irratibility may be caused by this medication as well.

After one dose_ I discontinued its use and called my doctor to ask for a different Rx. Now_ just one night later_ I'm still awake at 4:00AM because I've been itching. I didn't connect the itching to the Zyrtec until I crawled out of bed and read all the comments about itching and hives. Also I developed a bad cough that doesn't seem to have any cause. I didn't see that effect on anyone else's comments.,After just one day on this medication I can't even say that it helped my symptoms all that much.

At first I was very happy; I have no noticeable behavioral side effects - no fatigue_ dry mouth_ or any of the effects listed on the prescription bottle or here on this forum - my goodness_ this sounds like a bad drug for some people!  It is the only drug that has helped with my hives; Allegra-D gave me headaches_ and OTC medicines didn't work.  However_ I have been eating like a horse_ and have gained 5-7 lbs. in about a month.

1598, 1, sinusitis,My 8-year-old daughter was given zyrtec for 2 weeks to treat sinusitis first and then sinus infection. She became moody_ started displaying extreme anger and irritability. It culminated into a terrible_ violent temper tantrum on day 12_ in which she was screaming_ scratching her face and kicking everything around her. This is totally uncharacteristic for her. As a toddler she threw a few tantrums_ but never as violent as this. It didn't occur to me it was the medication until then. She's now off of it for 3 days. Lingering effects on her mood continue but to a lesser degree.,I had been reading on this site about similar effects on adults and children who took Claritin and other loratadine brands. She had taken Claritin for a week two months back_ for similar sinus-related complains. After the violent tantrum_ I checked for Zyrtec effects_ and was surprised to find the same. Our pediatrician never warned us of such side effects. All my research on the web didn't bring up anything like that_ until I FOUND THIS SITE. It's the only place where this information is available.

My doctors didn't believe me when I told them I'm worse trying to get off zyrtec then for the reason I went on it! Funny thing...my husband_ (on zyrtec for pet allergies)_ ran out of zyrtec when travelling for business and was up all night itching like crazy head to toe!He had to take Benedryl to stop it.Our dog & dander was not in his hotel room . I strongly believe there is some kind of addictive quality to this drug...it is like the histamines don't have anywhere to go once you try to stop taking it.You have to stay on it to stop the hives and itching it causes when you stop taking it! This is a nasty drug...I had to take Clariton(OTC) to get off Zyrtec.,F,43,3  years,2/11/2005,Zyrtec

1607, 1, Allergies (pet dander_ seasonal),Drowsiness_ depression_ mood swings,Seemed to work to control my allergies_ but changed my behavior and made me tired all the time.  Also_ if I missed a dose_ I would get a headache and feel nauseous until I took it again_ kind of like a migraine.  After I stopped taking it_ people commented that my behavior had changed to what it had been a few years ago when I was not taking Zyrtec.  I did get a free fleece blanket from Pfizer though_ so now when I go into Zyrtec withdrawl_ I'm not without comfort!  I really think that these side-effects/dangers should be given to you by your doctor or pharmacy before you start taking the medication.  The only way I was able to stop taking Zyrtec completely was to switch over to the CVS equivalent for a few months_ then start taking that every other day_ then eventually once every few days until I stopped getting headaches.  I still have to keep a bottle of Zyrtec around because every once in a while I'll get sick and nothing else will make it go away.  And also_ my doctors assure me that it's not the Zyrtec_ and perhaps I'm addicted to something else...whatever_ I wouldn't take this if I could go back_ Allegra would probably do the trick without the prolonged suffering.,M,15,3  years,11/26/2004,Zyrtec

1612, 1, Allergies / Hives,At first I didnt notice any neg. side effects and enjoyed not suffering from allergies.  But over the 3 months_ I became lethargic and became more aggressiveness.  Sounds conflicting_ but I went from doing stuff when I got home from work_ to just watching TV.  At work and with friends_ if someone annoyed me (which became easier over time)_ Id let them know in no uncertain terms they should stop.  Stopped using it 2 days ago and I am feeling a lot calmer.,Listen to your friends and family.  It took my roommate pointing it out for me to notice.  I remembered my brother-in-law saying something about stopping using Zyrtec because of mood side effects.  So I stopped and feel much better now.  I also found out my niece was almost expelled from school for disrptive behavior_ but settled down after taking her off it.

I feel sick like I've got a cold and my asthma has been very bad. Guess what I looked all zytec side effects on the internet and I have about 80% of them. I am going to stop taking it immediately.,People thinking about taking this drug should research it on the internet.

He said his heart felt funny and it was beating too fast and that his heartbeat was irregular. He's been very sorry that he took it this FIRST time.  This is a bad drug_ and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  I'm speaking from the point of view of someone who has watched her husband being scared all evening from taking it.  He won't be taking it again_ I can guarantee that.  I wish he hadn't taken it to begin with.

Almost like he had no control of his impulses and exaggerated temper.  This was not like him at all.  Stopped the medication and my nice son returned.  Sure he had a tantrum here and there but they were normal toddler ones...not scarry ones.,I was not aware until coming to this website that this can be a side effect.  His Dr. prescribed it for supplemental allergy fighter as he also takes Singulair and Pulmicort for his asthma.  I would rather him be congested and cough than have these fits.  I think we will stick to Claritin.,M,2.5,1  weeks,9/26/2004,Zyrtec
1620, 1, allergies,My 8 year old son took Zyrtec pretty regularly for 3 years_ taking breaks at times.  At first it seemed wondeful_ but then it built up in his system causing terrible side effects.

She says she just doesn't feel right_ her throat feels weird_ as does her stomach.  But the depression is what made me go on the computer tonight to find out more about this medication.
