0, 5, Jaw pain,Side effects for Opana (see comments) 10mg IR tablets: 1) elevated mood_ 2) decreased anxiety_ 3) suppressed appetite (enabling me to diet and lose 25 lbs_ which is a good thing!)_ 4) drowsiness_ 5) difficulty falling into a deep sleep for a couple of hours after taking it--basically I just doze (so I just avoid taking it immediately before bedtime). Overall_ the side effects for me are overwhelmingly positive_ actually!,"Opana is apparently essentially the same thing as Numorphan: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxymorphone (I contacted the askapatient.com site owners about adding the brand name ""Opana"" but received no response as of yet_ so I am posting my review on this page). I am taking Opana 10mg IR tablets. It has relieved my TMJ-related jaw pain significantly_ where none of the other pain meds I have tried (hydrocodone_ oxycodone_ tramadol) have.",F,30,6  months10mg OPANA 4X D,2/24/2010Email,Numorphan

2, 5, Lumbago-Sciatica-Disc Degeneration,The usual narcotic side effects_ but much less itching and redness in the face.,Most people get the 5 mg suppositories_ but the ampoules are the hydrogen bomb of pain-killers -- 20 mg up the main line (for me_ with my terrible narcotic tolerance) tackled the worst breakthrough pain I have ever had and allowed 100 per cent pain relief for the first time in more than seven years.  It would be good by mouth as well_ so I hope Endo succeeds in bringing back the tablets and marketing an oxymorphone analogue of Ms-Contin like they are trying to.,M,33,5  times,7/19/2005,Numorphan
