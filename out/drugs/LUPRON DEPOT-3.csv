My gut told me not to get it aND I did anyway in fear of what would happen if I didnt. I am supposed to get a second 3 month dose this month and I cancelled it.

4, 5, Endometriosis and ovarian cysts,After I was diagnosed with level 4 endometriosis_ my pain was so bad I could barley get out of bed most days I would just lay there and cry from the pain_ I had a laparoscopy to remove lesions_ I was told it would help me be pain free for years_ 8 weeks after my first surgery my pain was back and worse then ever_ my doctor recommended  hysterectomy and an oophorectomy (since I already had children and was unable to have anymore anyway) I was pain free for awhile after my surgery and when my pain came back I wasn't sure if I was imagining the pain or if I could still really have endometriosis... I had another surgery and still did that's when my doctor recommended me on this shot since it won't seem to go away. I was fairly skinny 105 lbs and in great shape_ after I took this shot I started packing on the pounds_ was extremely moody_ I had terrible hot flashes_ night sweats so bad I would have to shower in the middle of the night_ and I was either starving or could go days without eating. When I started my second round of lupron after another surgery my symptoms were a 100 times worse I started getting really bad insomnia and nightmares I maybe slept between 1 & 3 hours a night. This is the last time I will take this shot I would rather live with the debilitating pain then have the side effects from this shot.,,F,22,9  times3.75 mg,8/11/2014,Lupron depot-3

I do not reccomend trying to be in a relationship if he isn't ready for to deal with this cause I have been up and down with my emotions such as crying for no reason and getting irritated at the smallest of things. I sleep with my window open every night (and it's snowing outside) because i'll wake up dying of heat. All I want to do is lay in bed and eat food. I have struggled with being tired throughout the years but this is much worse. I go to work and put my head on my desk and fight to stay awake some days. I've gained about 10 lbs since I started the injection. And that is without changing my diet. Besides all the cons I would not stop taking it. I went from curled up in bed in so much pain to being able to work out for 45 minutes and walk up stairs without crying. So far the injection has been wonderful to help with the pain. I used to have cysts that would burst often and since I started the injection I have had none and have not felt any pain from them. If you can put up with the cons than you will feel much better. A few days ago I received my second injection.

I was off for only 1 month when I started getting my ovarian cysts back. They had to go in and do emergency surgery to remove a 10cm by10cm cyst from my right ovary when they went in they also found extreme endometriosis. My doctor told me that I had to go back on lupron for another 6 moths then on to birth control. Before I was on it I had extreme pain and bleeding_ after 3 months all my symptoms were gone. I had some side affects that were opposite of what most women experience. I was happy to go back on it again but also worried because i am coming up to the year mark here in a while and once that happens I have to come off it. I am not looking forward to that.

I've already had one ovary removed due to a lot of good sized cysts_ and have 2 beautiful children(and 2 miscarriages)_ and am soDone with dealing with this...I am feeling very lied to by the ob and would never wish this hell on anyone except maybe a serial killer or something.

20, 3, Endometriosis,I've taken the time to read over everyone else's experiences with this drug. You must understand going on this drug is by choice and for many different reasons. Many people have different side effects but here were mine; Headaches_ Weight gain(35 pounds to date)_ Tiredness_ Night sweats_ Hot Flashes_ Cold sweats_ The worst leg pain I've ever experienced_ loss of vision to an extent_feeling weak_ overall feeling like crap. ,I first got sick when I was 15. I've had 4 surgeries to date since then. Doctor One:First one at the age of 15 to remove polyps of the uturis and a D/C. No endo found at that point. Then tried many oral birth controls ended up at the first depo P. shot. Doctor Two: Second operation at the age of 17: I remember this quite well due to it was the week of xmas_ Found adhesions and cysts. No endo found at this time. Once again this second doctor said they had done what they could and put me back on b/c(birth-control) During these three years I had to drop out of public school and go to an online school_ I had my period at least 3 weeks out of a month. Pain was not tolerable. Finally at age 18 I went to see a specialist for endo in Hershey Pa. Doctor 3: First thing she said is I know you have endo we need to go to the operating table as soon as possible. By July 2010 I was on the table being cut open again. For the third time with the third doctor I had a D/C_ lap scope_ and four new incisions. When I was brought to I knew something wasn't right. Doctors all around me and my mom crying. They had finally found endo after my battle with doctors and pain for 4 years. What was suppose to be an hour operation turned into a 5 hour operation! The endo had moved onto my lungs_ appendix_ bowels_ bladder_ ovaries_ uturis_ ect. At my two week check up I was told how bad my endo was_ I was then told I needed to go on the lupron depot right away if I wanted any chance at one having kids and two,F,19,7  months 1X O,3/22/2011,Lupron depot-3
21, 5, Continuous bleeding and pain,Hot flashes_ painful injection site,I started the lupron injections four months ago after suffering continuous heavy bleeding and pain for about 18 months.  I was scared to try this therapy_ but my doctor made me feel more comfortable about it after talking with her.  I have had hot flashes and night sweats_ but the bleeding has stopped and the pain is more manageable.  My doctor said it's this therapy or a hysterectomy.  (This was my 4th opinion).  Since I have been unsuccessful in staying pregnant and do not have any children_ she recommended this therapy to give me a chance at having a child before a hysterectomy.  So far_ I do feel much better.  Sure_ there are are days where I feel horrible_ but it's so much better than it feeling bad everyday.  My doctor gave me a low dose of Lexapro to help with the hot flashes and night sweats and it has made a huge difference. I would recommend this to someone who may be in my situation.,F,26,4  months3.75 1X M,3/20/2011,Lupron depot-3

I experienced severe side-effects_ but the results were astounding I was able to get pregnant in 2007 and had a healthy_beautiful child. I had no pain or complications until getting pregnant in 2010 with my daughter. I developed a 12.6 cm endometrioma on my rt ovary and had to be monitored very closely during my pregnancy. I lost my daughter in my 3rd trimester to a cord accident and am now on my 2nd 6-month round of Lupron to attempt to avoid surgery and get pregnant again before I lose my reproductive organs for good. 2nd time_ milder symptoms_ but new and worsening memory and concentration issues are worrisome. I am also having muscle and joint pain and heart palpitations that I did not have last time that I attributed to age until reading this site. Lupron has been a miracle drug for me_aside from the side-effects_ and I hope this 2nd round passes quickly and does its job.

After a foot surgery in october 2010( dont know if its related) i started bleeding_ even though im on the pill_ and i bled for 4 months. I had a laprascopy in December 2010 and was diagnosed with moderate endometriosis. But after my surgery i could barly move for weeks_ i was in so much pain_ i had a pelvic infection and started intense antibiotics. After finishing them i was still bleeding_ not sleeping_ and in a ton of pain. I usually took something to knock me out so i wouldnt have to deal with the pain. Then i got the Lupron shot. at first it worked_ the bleeding and cramping stopped the first month. But this is my second month and i feel out of control. The hotflashes_ cravings_ dreams_headaches_ and backaches are killing me. I have to finish my dosage though_ so im hoping to not have to do this again.

I used to be hot all the time_ and now am more on the cold side and feel regulated. I am taking add-back therapy so that may be a helper.

26, 1, Pain_ endo?,Had an emergency hysterectomy after the birth of my son 19 years ago_ have had trouble ever since_ it's taken them this long to do anything!!! passing out with the pain_ only one ovary_ adhesions_ leg pain_ bowel problems,I was great at first_ even though the mood swings were awful and I was very very tired (I have narcolepsy and it seemed to make my symptoms there better too) but started getting chest pain within about 8 months and my blood pressure shot up!!..and stayed there! Massive weight gain_ my hair has thinned a great deal ( I have very very long hair so it has made a big impact) The hot flushes started to get unbearable_ I honestly felt that I would literally drop dead of heat exhaustion_ dramatic but true! Suicidal!!!Lost all my confidence_ have become a recluse..cannot lose weight no matter what I do_ I'm so tired. Developed a fistula so now a colostomy is on the cards_ the doctors can't tell me if it's connected or not.  I just feel like a lab rat frankly so I'm not having the shot anymore_ Totally fed up and have no life now. The oestrogen add back was the worst point. I was literally barking at the moon and I don't feel that I was monitored enough by the doctors.My life has ground to an abrupt halt completely and all the tiredness_ hair loss_ depression_ it's all been for nothing. I wish I'd never been put on it. I will never go back on this drug_ ever! I'm better of with nothing but my own oestrogen_ at least the symptoms were only monthly rather than all the time! I don't believe that the doctors know enough to prescribe this drug to women.

27, 1, Adenomyosis,I've suffered with adenomyosis_ probably for 35 years.  After years of being on various low-dose types of the Pill and Depo Provera_ nothing was very effective.  With Lupron Depot_ I had hot flashes_ cold chills_ and sweating all day.  I since decided to have a hysterectomy. I developed pain in my neck_ arm/leg joints_ and hips five months after my first (and last) injection. The joint pain has been getting progressively worse.,I did not have joint pain prior to taking this drug.  The 11.25 dosage is to be taken every three months.  Four months after the injection_ I had a hysterectomy (with my ovaries remaining).  I'm not in menapause and am still ovulating.  Prior to surgery_ I was in excellent health_ with no family history of arthitis.  I am very strong and was very mobile prior to surgery.  I'm taking it easy_ as it has only been five weeks since my surgery_ but I walk and move around and eat and sleep well.  But I'm surprised that the neck and joint pain started after the surgery (five months after the Lupron Depot injection).  The hot flashes and sweats have been greatly reduced since I started taking sage leaf extract a couple of times a day.  But I'm concerned that the drug has affected my immune system_ and I hope it hasn't triggered an auto-immune response in my body.,F,47,3  months11.25 1X O,12/17/2010Email,Lupron depot-3
28, 3, Endometriosis,Hot flashes and some restlessness at night,I just had my third shot of Lupron. So far I am having hot flashes a few days a week. I had surgery a couple months ago and had lots of endo removed. I am on Lupron in preparation for a second surgery on my bladder. Lupron will hopefully shrink the endo that is on my bladder. It is growing in a tricky area near the ureters and will be a risky surgery that could lead to more problems (bladder problems). Really hoping the Lupron shrinks what's there.

Directly following the second shot however_ the side effects got extreamly worse. I foolishly didnt do any research before accepting this shot_ I recomend that anyone being told that they should go on this_ DO RESEARCH! Endometreosis is a very common diagnosis among women_ almost 60% of women. I dont believe this drug has helped me at all. I believe it has made things worse. I have missed several day's of work because i couldnt function at all. The abdominal pain_ nausea_ hot flashes_ dizzy spells_ fainting_ back aches_ trouble sleeping...It felt like i had the flu for a month straight. ITS REDICULAS! i think all health care providers should definatly have an in depth conversation about the side effects with their patients they plan on giving this shot to. If the patient dosent mind having all these side effects on top of the endo-pain... go right ahead.. but personally I will never take this shot again!

The doctor couldn't remove it because he didn't want to damage my other organs.  So I did lupron once a month for 6 months. The first 5 months_ I was great on the shot with only acne and hot flashes as side effects. The 6th month however brought with it the rest of the side effects.  However_ the doc scheduled my surgery in October of 2005 after my last shot in August and was able to clean me out from the endo. In November I went on the shot for another 6 months due to the pelvic pain I was in while on the last month of the first 6 shots and wow_ did it ever get worse.  I thought it was the endo causing the pain but little did I know it was the shot.

33, 1, PROSTATE CANCER,In 2007 I had a radical prostatectomy. In 2009 my PSA went up. Dr recommended Lupron depot. Did not inform me of possible side effects. Now I have no muscle strength_ very poor endurance_ hot flashes_ very poor sleep_ memory loss_ very poor concentration_ irritability_ bouts of extreme depression_ vision changes_ and PAIN in legs.,When I went back to Dr he said my PSA was lower and would not need another injection. Stated I would never take another injection. This medicine has destroyed my life. I have been a paraplegic for 23 years. My life has gone from being independent to depending on others. I cannot make transfer into my car so now will have to buy van with lift. The pain in my legs seems to be bone pain mainly is in my left femur which has had no  feeling for 20+ years. Due to the muscle weakness I have fallen and fractured two bones in calf. Dislocated a finger and suffered a torn rotator cuff and head trauma. THIS MEDICINE SHOULD NEVER BE GIVEN TO A PARAPLEGIC WITHOUT AN EXPLANATION OF POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS!

34, 1, Ovarian Fibroid and Heavy Bleeding,Severe weight gain_ horrific hot flashes_ mood swings which effected my everyday life_ severe depression_ joint pain and frequent_ long lasting headaches.,I was happy with this medication on my first go around_ I used it for a little over a year and it did what it was suppose to do_ decreased pain_ stopped my bleeding.  After losing insurance coverage I had to go off this medication for about 2 years during which the pain and bleeding returned worse than before.  I was able to get back on the shot for about 1 1/2 years during which the side effects were awful.  I continued the shot because of the fear of the pain in my pelvic region returning and the uncontrollable bleeding.  I have been off the shot since Feb and all my old symptoms are returning.

Leg pain_ vertigo_ nausea_ vomiting_ fever_ chills_ sweats_ flu-like symptoms_ debilitation_ fatigue,I have known I've had fibroids for some 15 years now_ but they (one 15cm one_ plus other smaller ones) have become so problematic that my uterus was the size of a six-month pregnancy_ and was pressing on my leg veins (I've had a clot)_ and central veins (feeling dizzy if I lay on my back for too long).  I am of course a prime candidate for hysterectomy_ but do not want to have one for various reasons_ so was keen to try Prostap (UK name).  Was given the treatment (1-month depot injection) by the nurse who said that most women are fine_ without being told of the possible adverse side effects.  It was only after reading the leaflet later_ that I became concerned.  Felt OK in the first 2 weeks of treatment_ and it was like a miracle in terms of the notable uterine shrinkage.  My stomach became flat again_ and my legs stopped swelling up.  Great!  However_ I then developed the excrutiating leg pain (bone pain)_ that kept me awak at night.  Next was the vertigo attacks.  Usually on rising in the morning_ but so bad that I had to take time off work. Next was the worse nausea and vomiting I have experienced in my life_ to the point I had to go to A&E with dehydration from it.  Then came the flu-like symptoms and the hot flushes_ plus the affects on sleep.  As a business woman and fitness enthusiast_ the treatment has totally pollaxed me.

After a few days I started to experience obsessions with certain things_ and this developed into a mania over about 3 weeks.  Then I had what felt like an emotional crisis_ with insomnia_ anxiety_ extreme swings of mood (elation_ weeping) and over-reaction to any emotional event.  I felt I was deeply in love with one of my best friends!  (Never told her)  Also physical symptoms like palpitations and sweaty episodes_ but these were insignificant in comparison to the mind-bending effects.After 3 months the effects are wearing off_ thank god_ And I am much calmer.

I believe Tamoxifen does stimulate the endometrium because I got my period back after chemo_ 1 month after starting tamoxifen.  Therefore I used Lupron for ovarian suppression to hopefully keep my estrogen down and prevent reoccurance of my breast cancer.

49, 4, Endometriosis,"I took Lupron for 4 years off and on. I am 29 years old and was very concerned about infertility after having 2 lap's to remove adhesions and still experiencing pain. I happened to have a very good experience with Lupron but I do urge one to do tons of homework on this med and it's side effects prior to taking it. After 3 months on Lupron_ I had lost 10lbs_ was not experiencing as much pain_ felt much less moody and unpredictable_ and did not have a period through the whole course of my treatement. However_ I also experienced hot flashes that were out of this world_ occasional fatigue_ as well as osteopenia (or bone loss) in my hips and knees (Osteopenia has since improved with regular weight bearing exercise and calcium supplements) I stopped taking Lupron about 3 months ago and luckily all my symptoms went with it. My cycle is beginning to return but is in no way ""a regular monthly cycle.""",I am very sorry to hear about the awful effects this med has had on so many women. I have not read many positive ratings on this med and do feel very fortunate after reading all of yours. I_ like most of you_ did not do my homework and jumped on the Lupron wagon with my eyes wide shut. My 2 concerns were; 1. no more pain and unbearable periods but most importantly 2. Fertility protection. From what I have read these have been the concerns of most women contemplating Lupron therapy. We all must weigh out the risks and benefits of starting any new medication and it is always best to get more than one opinion especially if you do not fully trust your physician. Also_ there are many holistic therapies that have been effective in treating the pain associated with endo_ fibroids_ as well as other repoductive disorders. My recommendation to anyone considering Lupron therapy would be to seek out alternative therapies before putting this drug (or any drug) into your body.,F,29,4  years,11/10/2008,Lupron depot-3

Although my back pain subsided during the 6 mo. my other side effects were just as bad and the pain returned as soon as I stopped the Lupron.

My cousin and I used Lupron for endo ~6 years ago and now we have both been diagnosed with RA. We are only in our early 20's and have debilitating joint pain and she has had more health complications. I would not recomend Lupron to anyone.

I feel so out of control from this medicine sometimes that I don't even realize how I am acting. Just recently_ I have had vaginitis problems_ which I originally thought was yeast. My doctor actually had to give me an estrogen cream to use which has some wonderful side effects of its own. Not fun to say the least. I have also recently been experiencing depression and weight gain. It's no wonder my clothes don't fit! I am vegetarian_ exercise_ eat mostly organic foods and yet I still keep gaining weight.

The OB-GYN had tried every possible medication to help me_ and she finally suggested Lupron Depot-3.  At first. I was grateful for the cessation of my periods despite the night sweats and insomnia I experienced. With second shotcame the joint pain -- primarily in my fingers.

I had severe hot flahes in my first 2 months but now in my fourth they have gotten much better. I also feel tired a lot of the time. I made sure to start taking a multivitamin and calcium_ which I think helps. Although the two side-effects I described are bothersome...it is definitely worth it. I now realize that I didn't even know how much pain I was in until it was gone(after starting treatment.) I just always had pain and cramping so I thought it was normal.

83, 1, Endomitriosis andOvarian Cysts and,When I received the 1st shot my pelvic pain went away I had hot flashes but did not realize that I was having so mucm body pain by the end of the second shot I can barely move from the pain I lost 30 pounds feel like a truck ran over me and had to take so many meds for Insomnia depression anxiety voice change and joint muscleuar pain and a feeling of complete mood swings and missery. I feel apathy and can not concentrate also the shot gave me memmory loss. I will not get another injection ever in my life again.  Sure it took the pelvic pain away but I am afraid that I will suffer for a long time from the body pain.,I will never take it again.  The reason I took it is that the doctor needed to see how I would do with the shot to prove that I have endometriosis.  She was afraid to operate on me because I was on pain killers from the cyst and fibroids.  The doctors that I saw 5 in total all said that cysts do not cause pain the only doctor who said that that cysts cause pain was the Emergency room Doctor I had to go there several times and he said that many women have severe pain due to Cysts_ that I know for sure.  I have spoken to many women and they all said that they knew someone or they themselves had one and they had severe pain.  Now what? I wonder if anyone knows when will my body stop hurting?  I hope to spread awarenwss that ovarian cysts are very painfull and that you should have them removed because the shot is not worth it.  This is the worst I have ever felt in my entire life.

94, 1, Undiagnosed but possible Endo,After one week of my injection_ my pelvic pain became more severe than it ever has been_ and leg and joint pain worsened.  Research I have done since allowing my doctor to give me this injection tells me I should have never allowed it and won't be getting another one.,I was given another prescription for Norethindrone which is designed to help with the menopausal side effects of the injection.  Why this is helping to back of the pelvic pain_ I have no idea. (neither does my doctor) I have tried backing off on the dose since but the pain seems to come right back so I am staying on my dose of 10mg a day.  The leg pain seems to come and go but I have had a few bouts that are enough to make me cry_ and can't seem to find a way to help that.  I have been taking a pain medication every night before bed to try to help this_ but it is not something I can take during the day if I go to work.  I have appointments set up with two other doctors in the next few months to find some help with this.  Research suggests that the best way to resolve endo is to have laproscopic surgery to exise it and that is what I will be asking about with these new doctors.
