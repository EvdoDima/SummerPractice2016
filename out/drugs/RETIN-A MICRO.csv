2, 3, Acne,"Ok so I'm on Retin-A Micro .1% for a month and 1 day. I think yesterday I started the ""purging"" phase D: I am getting more pimples at one time than I have every before. The type of pimples if you touch them_ you can feel pain/soreness. It really sucks but I am going to stick through it and update you all for month 2.I believe my skin is sensitive because EVERY pimple I get_ it leaves a red mark afterwards :( it sucks cuz it looks like I still have pimples. I've been peeling a little and I've noticed little improvement in fading the marks. Hopefully the old marks and current marks will start to fade more.Also since I use foundation to cover up my pimples and marks_ I've been using neutrogen makeup remover and cleanser foam. I really love it so if you are using makeup also make sure you find a good makeup remover that works for you! Because not removing the makeup properly can be a huge reason for getting pimples.",,F,22,1  months 1X D,5/3/2015Email,Retin-a micro

16, 4, Acne,Brief dryness patches at first_ but suddenly around 4 weeks had horrible micro bumps then peeling of entire face (still occuring now).,I used retin a micro a few years ago when my acne first got bad (age 19.)  I went through bad initial break out ( I had moderate inflammed acne to begin with) but once it was over I had glowing white skin.  I used for 2 years_ but then stopped when I ran out of prescription and was too lazy to refill_ and because I was experiencing very clear skin.  4 months later I started to have hormonal breakouts again and just unreliable skin in general.  I have restarted using retin a 0.04% because I know it will work for me again.  Weeks 1-3 I had the same minor break outs I was having before starting_ and minor dry skin patches that I could slough off with wet rag.  However_ starting week 4_ I experienced an entire burning of the skin_ practically over night_ and have no idea why....I am very meticulous about how much I use and about waiting at least 30 minutes after washing face to use.  I usually take 1 night a week off as well to just readjust to the side effects.  This recent dryness has been unexpected and because of that it's hard to deal with mentally! But I know it'll work out--just takes some time.  Anyone going through this try not to fret!  It will give you glowing skin.  When I finally do have results_ I will be putting online a full log with pictures of almost every 2 days of my progress to help those going through first rough 3 months : )  Look forward to it!,F,22,5  weeks0.04 6X W,8/11/2011,Retin-a micro

18, 5, moderate acne_ acne scars,peeling_ redness_ dryness_ itchiness,I had moderate acne_ but dreadful post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and light acne scarring_ which plagued me for years before my parents finally sanctioned a visit to the dermo. I started Yaz about a month before_ and my doc started a course of doxycycline 100 mg 2x daily_ and retin-a micro 1x daily. My skin had a very light initial rxn to both the topical and oral treatments within the first week_ but nothing awful. Then my skin started flaking horribly_ and more sensitive skin areas become frightfully red and dry and peely_ as if I got a sunburn and it was healing. This cleared quickly_ leaving newer_ brighter skin in its wake_ but this still happens from time to time_ revealing nicer skin each time. I never had an awful initial breakout (at least_ not yet!)_ but I still get a pimple every couple of days that is gone by the next day_ with v. little PIH. My acne is now light_ my PIH and (light-to-begin-with) scars are starting to fade. I flake occasionally_ but nothing intolerable_ and my skin is SO smooth_ even the places to which I have not applied the retin-a micro. I hope it keeps getting better_ and doesn't come back once I stop_ because it's been very nice clearing the ghost-like PIH that's been haunting my otherwise porcelain skin for so long.,F,20,6  weeks 1X D,7/26/2011,Retin-a micro

It seemed to work really well now but now I haven't seen significant results and I am considering Accutane.   For the people who complain about their acne getting worse_ thats what its suppose to do.  It makes all the acne thats inside come to the surface.  No matter what you will eventually get the pimples_ Retin-A just makes them come out quicker and go away faster.  Most pimples you have_ have developed for about a month before its visible.

24, 5, Moderate Acne,Initial peeling_ Initial break out,Hello_ I have been dealing with acne problems since teenager. I had severe acne during my teenage. Later in my early 20's_ I spent lot of money on microderma_ facials and other acne control products. I did not visit any dermatologists as I had no faith in them. I think this was the biggest mistake I did. In my 20's_ I had moderate acne. I decided to visit derm for acne problem and she prescribed me a topical cream(antibiotic) in am and Retin A micro gel 0.04 in pm. And i switched to cereve cream and face wash since then. First week_ i had lot of peeling. 2nd week_ my skin felt very soft and was glowing. 3rd week onwards_ I got my worst ever break outs. These break outs were very different from the once i used to get_ they were bumpy_ reddish and took more time to fade. In my case the intial break out lasted exactly from 3rd week to 12th week. I got around 3 new acnes every week. The last set of acnes were in 12th week. After 3 months_ Initial break out stopped and my skin is more soft and smooth. Retin A also helped improve my complexion and removed all those ugly comedons. I am glad i stuck to the cream and I will always. I hope my review was helpful. My advise is to stick to this cream_ it will definitely work.,F,26,6  months 1X D,3/21/2011,Retin-a micro

Now about on the 6th week im starting to clear up :) ps.. used cetaphil face was first 2 weeks.,One. Your skin will be very dry_ dehydrated find a good moisturizer _ with me i couldnt use one but every few days_ or id break out worse but make sure ur staying hydrated! Drink lots of water_ take omega 3's _ and choose a good toner (aveda dry skin ) That can be used through out the day and helps hide the flakes.  Also never pull off the flakes gently exfoliate with ur fingers in the shower :).Two. After your face gets a lil used to retin A's peeling (2weeks) add in benzoyl peroxide wash 5% is good twice a day and possibly advance to a gel if still needed Remember these two will work together very well but dont rush it ! If needed an antibiotic might do you well try solodyn_ similar to doxycycline yet this drug allows sun sexposure :). Sun block is a must yet it breaks me out :/ Remeber this is one of the most important to remember if ur out but u a cute visor i know thats difficult!_ untill your face is ready to tolerate the spf's as well.  This is alot yes but hey how long did you have acne its not gonna go away in a day :( I say give it 2 months no change u may need something differnt.

44, 5, Acne,None so far.,Alright_ I just started yesterday and from reading the reviews before hand I got a hold of a couple things to ensure success. Most of the reviews I read of people taking it at least 3 months said they experienced much worse acne before it got better. Because of this I'm using the thinnest layer possible for the first two weeks so that maybe my skin can get acclimated without the break outs.  Many said they experience peeling as well. So_ I got Olay moisture_ 100 SPF sunblock_ and a gentle moisturizer/cleanser. I'll be updating my rating in 3 months time. Good luck everybody.,M,21,1  days1g 1X D,7/1/2010Email,Retin-a micro

My Derm. was not helpful during the process so we changed doctors. At my first appointment the new derm. told me that the gel should have worked by now(4 months) and put me on a new cream.

Now I still use it nightly along with Aczone during the day and Doryx pill once a day and my skin is basically clear for the most part. I still get the hormonal pimples but that lasts a week or two and never severe anymore. It just takes time_ but it's worth it when you stick it out.

I would get breakouts mainly on my chin and it would take months to go away and would leave heavy scarring. I was so fed up with breaking out so much that my sister recommended retin-a micro. She used that medication when she was going through her breakout phase. I used it and during the first two weeks_ my skin looked awful! I couldn't even go out in public because my skin was so red! I was really depressed and I was about to give up but then I decided to stick it out. It's been about 4 weeks now and my skin around my chin was improved by 50 percent.

So I don't know if that's a real improvement. Of course_ the doctor never warned me that (1) the drug takes a while_ (2) it causes break-outs early-on_ and (3) it's very hard on sensitive skin.

I am a pharmacy tech and was going to give a few tips for using this medication. First of all_ wait 30 minutes after washing face before applying. Use just enough to cover face avoiding mouth_ eyes_ and creases in nose. Leave on overnight and wash off in the morning. If you experience peeling that is normal because the medication works much like a chemical peel. If you experience burning decrease the frequency of use. The first time I was put on it_ I was told to use it every night which cause horrible burning. Wrong! If you start 3 times per week and increse slowly from there_ you will have far less side effects. Also_ I read of a patient also using benzoyl peroxide. The benzoyl peroxide works by killing bacteria on skin but it will increase dryness. The retin-a works by increasing skin cell turnover thus pushing all the pore clogging stuff out of your skin. The retin-a is a derivative of,M,23,8  months,10/24/2008Email,Retin-a micro

90, 3, acne,Ive been using it for about a year_and ive had redness_and alot of peeling.I would go to school and i would have skin peeling off my face.It was very embaresssing.,Dont go in the sun_while on it!.Even when i used a sunscreen of 45 on my face_the sun really agrevated it_and made my skin sting and prick and itch and stuff.Overall it cleared up some of my acne_but i still have alot of it.,F,16,1  years,7/26/2008Email,Retin-a micro
91, 2, steroid-induced acne,redness_ peeling,Supposedly this is less harsh on your skin than regular Retin-A. That wasn't my experience. My skin was actually redder using Retin-A Micro than regular Retin-A. Regular Retin-A also seemed to work better_ especially for scars_ which I have. (When I asked my regular doctor if he could prescribe something for the cystic acne the steroids were giving me_ he told me not to do anything and that it'd go away on its own--stupidly I believed him_ and not doing anything about cystic acne ended up leaving scars all over my face.),M,19,1  years,7/26/2008,Retin-a micro
92, 4, Moderate Acne,Well i've only been using it 2 days_ but my face is itching like crazy!!!...and it wont stop_ what does this mean???? anybody??? but it seems like its working_ im only on day 2 so i dont see any MAJOR improvements yet.,I use CeraVe moisturizing lotion that i get from my dermatologist. And also a benzoyl peroxide creamy wahs i have to wash my face with. Everything seems fine except the itching is driving me nuts!,F,19,2  days,7/23/2008Email,Retin-a micro

Not only has it improved the acne on my chin already_ its helping with my backne a HUGE AMOUNT! i can actually go out in a bikini now! i think that's because i started it on my back before i started on my face...Anyways_ for anyone with backne problems I recommend this!!!! and its working pretty well on my face too!",F,14,5  weeks,7/17/2008,Retin-a micro
94, 4, acne_ scaring,dry skin_ itchy skin_ peeling skin_ redness_ dryness in the corner of my mouth_ sensitive to touch and EXTREME BURNING!!,I've only been using Retin-A (0.1%) for a little over a week. I get a few occasional pimples_ but I wanted to be carefree and zit free so I started using this stuff. The first day I used it I noticed my skin felt really tight and dry. I used Aveeno moisterizer with SPF. The dermo said to keep the medication AWAY from sensitive spots such as around the eyes_ the crease of your nose and around the mouth/lips. I woke up the 2nd morning using it and the corners of my lips were SOO cracked_ it hurt to open my mouth or even smile. Well after using it for over a week_ Ive noticed my skin has broken out WAY worse than it ever has_ although its only around my jawline_ my cheeks and forehead are acne free. Im in the peeling and itching stage_ Im sticking it out_ Ive only seen a few negative feedbacks and ive had the same side effects as 98% of the posts ive read. Im gonna hang in there and hope for the best:-D Good luck everyone.,F,23,1  weeks,7/10/2008,Retin-a micro
95, 2, Controlling acne,Small acne bumps_ lots of blackheads where I previously didn't have them_ itching and burning when used without a good moisturizer_ peeling,I do not suggest Retin-A Micro_ by the time I started using it my acne was pretty much under control using Differin. My dermatologist decided to switch me to Retin-A_ and I began experiencing more breakouts than any time I was on Differin. My pores are now extremely visible_ my face is no longer smoothe_ and I have blackheads and bumps everywhere. I'm going in to get my medication switched next week.,F,18,2  months,7/8/2008,Retin-a micro
96, 5, ongoing acne,"i used this product twice_ once my junior/senior year in highschool...and that time i had EXTREAMLY dry skin because i used too much too often_ thinking it would make it work faster(WRONG!!!)..my acne went away and my freshmen year of college i stoped using it because i thought my acne was going to be fine.. i recently started using it again to clear up some acne problems that just wouldnt go away for months. ... a little dryness.. but NOTHING like the first time. USE LOTION!! if you wash gently_ and use lotion in the morning after showering_ and at night after washing... side effects are minimal.. the ""extreme dryness and redness"" is just because people use it incorrectly.. acne got worse but within the first week it was 100% better!!",this product worked well the first time i used it and i am now using it again.. just finished week one and my acne is cleared already. a few red marks but makeup covers it fine... the cream really helps get rid of darker pigments because of scarring as well. others say it didnt work for a few weeks-months..but for me it worked within the first week. JUST USE LOTION AND ONLY A PEA SIZE AMOUNT OF CREAM!!!!!!!!,F,19,1  days,6/11/2008,Retin-a micro
97, 3, adult acne,very dry_ itchy_ peeling_ blushing_ chapped skin,I didn't see  change the first 2 weeks but week 3 and 4 I was super exited and happy with the results because my skin was clear smooth and had a glow to it thanks to the cleanser and moisturizer recommended by my doctor cetaphil.  BUT on week 5 my face started to feel itchy_ peeling and has red tones again.  The dry feel all over my skin is really bothering me and when I wash or apply moisturizer my skin BURNS!  I am hoping the results will become positive again soon.,F,25,5  weeks,5/23/2008,Retin-a micro
98, 5, adult acne_ some scarring,dryness_ some burning_ acne gets worse before it gets better,I've taken everything you name it.  Out of all the stuff for acne_ I don't think there's anything much better than Retin-A micro (that I know of).  I've tried Accutane while I was a teenager and it had amazing results but the acne still came back so its not a permanent fix and the treatment is very rigorous on your skin (imagine Retin-A side effects and multiply that by 20).  If you do take Retin-A_ definitely recommend Cetaphil or Purpose cleanser - I use Cetaphil.  Also_ to be more aggressive with acne_ ask your doctor about taking an antibiotic as well.  Currently I do Retin-A every night_ and take an antibiotic called Bactrim (twice a day).  This is a great antibiotic that does not appear to have major side effects that I know of.  Here's a link http://www.acne.org/bactrim-septra-trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-reviews/268/page1.html,F,27,4  weeks,5/5/2008,Retin-a micro
99, 5, painful acne flareups,some peeling_ some dry patches_ NO redness_ NO pink tinge to my skin. MOISTURIZATION is the key.,I have been using  0.025% retin a cream. I was scared when i read reviews about retin a prior to using it. But_retin a is amazing and i have found 3 products that keep my skin from flaring up. One is Eucerin redness relief spf 15 moisturizer. It Does not irritate my skin_ and does a wonderful job of moisturizing (absorbs quickly). The 2nd product is Evian facial mist. This stuff works wonders if my skin starts to feel dry during the day. Cetaphil cleanser is great as well...not drying and very gentle. The combo of these 3 products have helped to keep my skin well hydrated. I am VERY happy with my results so far with retin a micro. My skin has a smoother texture_ i have less acne_ my skin tone is more even. I have a glow to my face_ and I do not require heavy makeup to try and make my skin look good. I do get some dry patches_ but it is not severe_ i just spray the evian face mist. I also do get some peeling_ but once again_ not severe_ and with moisturization it improves almost immedia,F,27,4  weeks,4/8/2008,Retin-a micro
100, 4, moderate adult acne_ blackheads,Usual side effects: some redness_ small swelling_ peeling_ some worsening (purging),I'm in the middle of week 3_ and things have been going similarly to what the website says to expect.  There definitely are tricks to the trade; I had 1-2 days of chin reaction (swelling_ itchy redness) and refrigerated Aloe Vera gel really helped the irritation & peeling!  I'm a working adult and have to go out_ so using different things like airbrush makeup (you can stipple it on_ as opposed to rubbing it on which encourages peeliness)_ and using calming products for red/reactive skin (Aveeno ultra-calm).  Even with the side effects_ and initial purging/breakout - my skin has a softer_ more even tone and I can see how it might look in a few more weeks when the purging stops.  The side effects are difficult_ but I'm going to keep going!  It isn't a quick solution_ so practice patience and give it some time.,F,31,3  weeks,4/5/2008,Retin-a micro
101, 4, Cystic Acne,Skin was red and peeled where applied_ dry lips_ dry skin around eyes,Seemed to work well_ though not 100%.  The red and peeling skin was easy to get rid of thanks to Aquaphor.  I still get a few acne cysts every few weeks_ but they go away within a few days (instead of weeks).  Also_ they are not as painful or noticeable as when I was not on Retin-A.  However_ I'm going to try Accutane next.,F,26,1  years,3/31/2008,Retin-a micro
102, 5, acne,For the first couple of weeks my face was red_ burning and peeling. I even broke out alot worse. After about a month my face stop breaking out the redness stopped as well as the peeling. I had very dark marks on both sides of my face including my forehead. They was marks I had for all the acne I had before using retin-a micro 0.04%. I really didn't think this stuff would work because I started breaking out even more. I was so scared I called my doctor but she told me that is what it was suppose to do. I also read about it online and the website side the same thing. After a month later I am so glad I continued using it. My skin is so smooth the complexion of my face is much better_ those very dark marks I had faded a lot. they are extremely light now but like I said its only been a month. Most importantly I don't break out anymore. I think you break out more when using it because the gel is doing its job. It is actually cleaning out your pores. So I'm glad it made me break out more caus,,F,27,30  days,3/30/2008,Retin-a micro

I've had pretty steady acne for about 10 years now and nothign has worked....I have tried accutane_ proactive_ bp_ jsut about everything....is this just another thing to get my hopes up....,M,23,8  days,3/6/2008,Retin-a micro
104, 3, Moderate acne,Peeling_ larger pores,I have been on Retin-A Micro 0.1% for 4 months.  Like others_ my skin got better for the first two weeks and then worse.  4 months in and my skin is still terrible...much worse than it has ever been.  The pores on my forehead seem to have actually gotten larger_ but I get blackheads which come out easily rather than cysts.  However_ fine lines have gotten better and my skin does feel generally smoother.  I will try to continue to be patient...perhaps that I have had moderate acne since I was 17 requires a lot of purging.,F,28,4  months,3/1/2008,Retin-a micro
105, 5, Acne - Blackheads_ Pustules,Peeling and redness_ and an increase in breakouts for the first two weeks_ then ACNE FREE!,I have had two or three enormous zits (in a field of blackheads) on my face pretty much constantly from age 13 to today (age 21). EIGHT YEARS OF HELL WITH NO END IN SIGHT!! It was ruining my life. I finally went to the Derm. and he perscribed Retin-A every other night and BenzaClin every morning. Important note to Retin-A users - I know at first it can be discouraging - your skin will look terrible for a little while - BUT IT IS SO WORTH IT! After two and a half months (10 weeks roughly) my skin looks amazing! There's still some light scarring_ but even the scars (which were horrible 8 weeks ago) have faded alot. Trust me - stick it out and rough it through the first adjustment phase_ and you will love the results.,M,21,2.5  months,2/24/2008,Retin-a micro
106, 5, terrible/prolonged forehead acne,No initial outbreak really_ just steady improvement all the way through; barely noticeable peeling_ no redness_ somewhat oily,My forehead exploded in November (to the point that I literally hid for two months - I've never seen acne that bad on anyone). I finally saw a doctor who put me on retin-a micro. I'm moving into my sixth week_ and absent a blackhead_ my forehead is completely clear. Of course there are several pink hyperpigmentations but retin-a is clearly helping with that and I suspect that those will be gone in about two weeks. This stuff is amazing and I have every intention of staying on it (word on the street is that it prevents wrinkles). Really I have nothing bad to say about this stuff - as shallow as it sounds_ it helped take me out of a very bad depression.,F,20,37  days,2/24/2008,Retin-a micro

That stuff is a joke. I even tried the off brand you can get at the store. I'm only on my 4th day using retin-a micro but I'm  not sure I can take the burning. I had to stick my face in the freezer last night!! I'm going to try my best to suck it up because I read all the reviews on this site and everyone says it works. I don't really care about breaking out really bad either because I've had to deal with it for years anyway. My face hasn't started to peel yet but I feel it starting to get really dry. I hope this stuff works.,F,19,4  days,1/30/2008,Retin-a micro
109, 3, Adult Acne,Peeling similiar to a moderate sunburn_ and some scaly spots.,I am into my third week. My doctor gave me antibiotics as well as a benzol-peroxide for the mornings. I read on the website that the two conteract eachother (!!???) - and as the combination was so drying_ I am sticking to Retin-A at night only for now. My doctor also said not to moisturize_ which seems to excacerbated the peeling. I have combination skin_ so dealing with peeling in the morning and oiliness during the afternoon is taking a toll...I am and have been seriously addicted to exfoilating and at-home micro peels_ etc. Giving those up have been hard. Does anyone know of a MILD exfoliant that can help with the peeling without irritating the skin? A wet wash cloth is as good as it gets for me - everything else stings like hell.,F,24,3  weeks,1/23/2008,Retin-a micro

This all happen in the matter of 4 months after I started using it. A good piece of advice stay away from salicsilic acid (sp?)and wash your face with Purpose_ and Use Aveeno Ultra Calming lotion with SPF on your face!,Five months later...I'm so glad I didn't quit Retin a micro. My skin has NEVER been this clear and the skin tone is..EVEN! I wash me face and don't feel a pimple! Don't quit using this product if after 5 months you don't notice a amazing difference ok quit.

111, 3, Oversized pores_ minor acne.,I started using Retin-A Micro because_ on accident_ I made several of the pores on my forehead gigantic from squeezing them so many times. Plus_ I had occasional minor acne. After a day or two_ my skin was amazing. Then_ I broke out. For the next few months_ each day I would get a new_ deeply irritated pore. They would go away_ but they were very bothersome. After about four months_ the acne did mostly subside. I don't have any severe acne anymore. The problem is: I never had bad acne to begin with. The worst part is that_ now_ my skin has small little cracks all over it_ even after using tons of moisturizer_ I have a scaly dry little patch on each side of my forehead_ and my face appears to be oily than ever before. It fixed the problem I had_ but now I have several new ones. Retin-A Micro will get rid of your acne eventually_ but I would recommend using Cetaphil as a moisturizer throughout the entire process.

112, 3, Acne,Peeling_ redness & worsened breakouts,I am now in my fourth week with Retin-A.  Also taking Tetracyclen & just started Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo two weeks ago.  Never used to break out this badly - once in my early twenties I started to have bad acne on my chin_ went on birth control and used Benzamycin and it took care of it. Now_ once again - at 27 it's back. I only break out on my chin - and the Retin-A seems to be bringing everything to the surface (which is what it's supposed to do).  Had really bad redness and peeling in the 2nd to third week_ and now have been breaking out pretty badly this week!  A little frustrating right now but I am willing to stick it out because I read that you're supposed to see full results after the sixth week.  I am keeping my fingers crossed!!

115, 4, Acne,Some drying after washing it away with a cleanser.,I used this product with minocycline when i was 17 and i saw results immediately. I think if you take an antibiotic with retin-a micro it is less likely to see bad break outs in the beggining. I have oily skin so i believe the excessive peeling was no issue for me. My skin felt really normal and great that i went off of it thinking i had grown out of acne. My Mistake. During the 2006 year i used 2.5 benzoyl peroxide which worked ok but i went back to my dermatologist and she made me try differin. I used differin for 4 weeks and it really gave me a bad initial breakout- i did not use antibiotics with differin. I told my doctor i wanted to go back to retin a micro since it cost the same as differin. So now i am using retin a micro with antibiotics and i see i am getting better again. My only problem is that i dont have health insurance and my Total cost for 2 months of prescription RETIN-A 45 grams and Minocycline 50 grams QTY. 60 pills runs $171.25,M,19,2  weeks,8/23/2007,Retin-a micro

My dark spots have subsided a lot and I have very few blimishes.  I know two more weeks will do wonders on my skin.  This stuff is well worth a try.  Proactive has nothing on this!
