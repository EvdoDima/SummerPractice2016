2, 3, Acne,"Ok so I'm on Retin-A Micro .1% for a month and 1 day. I think yesterday I started the ""purging"" phase D: I am getting more pimples at one time than I have every before. The type of pimples if you touch them_ you can feel pain/soreness. It really sucks but I am going to stick through it and update you all for month 2.I believe my skin is sensitive because EVERY pimple I get_ it leaves a red mark afterwards :( it sucks cuz it looks like I still have pimples. I've been peeling a little and I've noticed little improvement in fading the marks. Hopefully the old marks and current marks will start to fade more.Also since I use foundation to cover up my pimples and marks_ I've been using neutrogen makeup remover and cleanser foam. I really love it so if you are using makeup also make sure you find a good makeup remover that works for you! Because not removing the makeup properly can be a huge reason for getting pimples.",,F,22,1  months 1X D,5/3/2015Email,Retin-a micro

16, 4, Acne,Brief dryness patches at first_ but suddenly around 4 weeks had horrible micro bumps then peeling of entire face (still occuring now).,I used retin a micro a few years ago when my acne first got bad (age 19.)  I went through bad initial break out ( I had moderate inflammed acne to begin with) but once it was over I had glowing white skin.  I used for 2 years_ but then stopped when I ran out of prescription and was too lazy to refill_ and because I was experiencing very clear skin.  4 months later I started to have hormonal breakouts again and just unreliable skin in general.  I have restarted using retin a 0.04% because I know it will work for me again.  Weeks 1-3 I had the same minor break outs I was having before starting_ and minor dry skin patches that I could slough off with wet rag.  However_ starting week 4_ I experienced an entire burning of the skin_ practically over night_ and have no idea why....I am very meticulous about how much I use and about waiting at least 30 minutes after washing face to use.  I usually take 1 night a week off as well to just readjust to the side effects.  This recent dryness has been unexpected and because of that it's hard to deal with mentally! But I know it'll work out--just takes some time.  Anyone going through this try not to fret!  It will give you glowing skin.  When I finally do have results_ I will be putting online a full log with pictures of almost every 2 days of my progress to help those going through first rough 3 months : )  Look forward to it!,F,22,5  weeks0.04 6X W,8/11/2011,Retin-a micro

18, 5, moderate acne_ acne scars,peeling_ redness_ dryness_ itchiness,I had moderate acne_ but dreadful post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and light acne scarring_ which plagued me for years before my parents finally sanctioned a visit to the dermo. I started Yaz about a month before_ and my doc started a course of doxycycline 100 mg 2x daily_ and retin-a micro 1x daily. My skin had a very light initial rxn to both the topical and oral treatments within the first week_ but nothing awful. Then my skin started flaking horribly_ and more sensitive skin areas become frightfully red and dry and peely_ as if I got a sunburn and it was healing. This cleared quickly_ leaving newer_ brighter skin in its wake_ but this still happens from time to time_ revealing nicer skin each time. I never had an awful initial breakout (at least_ not yet!)_ but I still get a pimple every couple of days that is gone by the next day_ with v. little PIH. My acne is now light_ my PIH and (light-to-begin-with) scars are starting to fade. I flake occasionally_ but nothing intolerable_ and my skin is SO smooth_ even the places to which I have not applied the retin-a micro. I hope it keeps getting better_ and doesn't come back once I stop_ because it's been very nice clearing the ghost-like PIH that's been haunting my otherwise porcelain skin for so long.,F,20,6  weeks 1X D,7/26/2011,Retin-a micro

It seemed to work really well now but now I haven't seen significant results and I am considering Accutane.   For the people who complain about their acne getting worse_ thats what its suppose to do.  It makes all the acne thats inside come to the surface.  No matter what you will eventually get the pimples_ Retin-A just makes them come out quicker and go away faster.  Most pimples you have_ have developed for about a month before its visible.

24, 5, Moderate Acne,Initial peeling_ Initial break out,Hello_ I have been dealing with acne problems since teenager. I had severe acne during my teenage. Later in my early 20's_ I spent lot of money on microderma_ facials and other acne control products. I did not visit any dermatologists as I had no faith in them. I think this was the biggest mistake I did. In my 20's_ I had moderate acne. I decided to visit derm for acne problem and she prescribed me a topical cream(antibiotic) in am and Retin A micro gel 0.04 in pm. And i switched to cereve cream and face wash since then. First week_ i had lot of peeling. 2nd week_ my skin felt very soft and was glowing. 3rd week onwards_ I got my worst ever break outs. These break outs were very different from the once i used to get_ they were bumpy_ reddish and took more time to fade. In my case the intial break out lasted exactly from 3rd week to 12th week. I got around 3 new acnes every week. The last set of acnes were in 12th week. After 3 months_ Initial break out stopped and my skin is more soft and smooth. Retin A also helped improve my complexion and removed all those ugly comedons. I am glad i stuck to the cream and I will always. I hope my review was helpful. My advise is to stick to this cream_ it will definitely work.,F,26,6  months 1X D,3/21/2011,Retin-a micro

Now about on the 6th week im starting to clear up :) ps.. used cetaphil face was first 2 weeks.,One. Your skin will be very dry_ dehydrated find a good moisturizer _ with me i couldnt use one but every few days_ or id break out worse but make sure ur staying hydrated! Drink lots of water_ take omega 3's _ and choose a good toner (aveda dry skin ) That can be used through out the day and helps hide the flakes.  Also never pull off the flakes gently exfoliate with ur fingers in the shower :).Two. After your face gets a lil used to retin A's peeling (2weeks) add in benzoyl peroxide wash 5% is good twice a day and possibly advance to a gel if still needed Remember these two will work together very well but dont rush it ! If needed an antibiotic might do you well try solodyn_ similar to doxycycline yet this drug allows sun sexposure :). Sun block is a must yet it breaks me out :/ Remeber this is one of the most important to remember if ur out but u a cute visor i know thats difficult!_ untill your face is ready to tolerate the spf's as well.  This is alot yes but hey how long did you have acne its not gonna go away in a day :( I say give it 2 months no change u may need something differnt.

44, 5, Acne,None so far.,Alright_ I just started yesterday and from reading the reviews before hand I got a hold of a couple things to ensure success. Most of the reviews I read of people taking it at least 3 months said they experienced much worse acne before it got better. Because of this I'm using the thinnest layer possible for the first two weeks so that maybe my skin can get acclimated without the break outs.  Many said they experience peeling as well. So_ I got Olay moisture_ 100 SPF sunblock_ and a gentle moisturizer/cleanser. I'll be updating my rating in 3 months time. Good luck everybody.,M,21,1  days1g 1X D,7/1/2010Email,Retin-a micro
45, 1, Acne,Skin dry_ pealing_ bright red,I stayed on Retin a micro for over 3 months and it did not help at all. I had mild acne before using it and now i have moderate acne with terrible scars. My Derm. was not helpful during the process so we changed doctors. At my first appointment the new derm. told me that the gel should have worked by now(4 months) and put me on a new cream. Taking retin a micro was probably the worst decision of my life and i still regret it to this day.,F,16,3  months.1 % 1X D,6/15/2010,Retin-a micro

47, 5, mild acne,redness_ peeling_ burning upon application_ acne got worse for a couple weeks,I actually was on retin a micro when I was a sophomore in high school (about 5 years ago). My skin constantly peeled_ stayed red_ and acne got worse in the beginning weeks_ peeling and redness continued for 2 months but after the break out period my face completely cleared up and I stayed on the medication until I ran out. My face was clear for about a year without using anything. Then over the past 4 years it's worked itself back up to a mild case and I have decided to try it again_ hopefully the starting weeks won't be as bad as i remember!,F,21,8  months.04 1X D,4/21/2010,Retin-a micro

49, 5, mild acne,dryness_redness_ peeling_ flaking_irritation and sensitivity,"I love this product. It really works. First off_ be prepared for ""the uglies"" to come out. Within the first 2 weeks_ the worst pimples of my life started coming up along with severe dryness. By week 7_ the acne finally subsided and my skin under the flaking looked brand new! Now 4 months later_ I still use the gel at night along with a gentle cleanser and moisturizer day and night. AND I'm finally getting complimented on how pretty my skin is. It's important to stick to it_ even when everyone is telling you to stop---don't listen!",F,28,4  months 1X D,2/26/2010,Retin-a micro
50, 4, acne,PEELING PEELING AND MORE PEELING,"I started this topical treatment 1 week ago. I had a few acne bumps on each cheek. Within the first day those bumps were all gone. I still have bumps but i know they will clear up in a couple of moths. I am serious DREADING the ""big breakout"" but i'm gonna stick it out. I really recommend this product so far. I use cetaphil as a face was and i have a cetaphil sunsceen moisturizer that i use when i go out into the sun_ and i also have another normal cetaphil moisturizer for sensitive skin which works wonders.. They both have really helped with the peeling which kicked in on day 3. Wish me luck!!",F,15,1  weeks 1X D,2/22/2010,Retin-a micro
51, 4, Acne,Peeling for the first 2-3 months... learned to keep my face moisturized and always use gentle cleansers(I use Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing Bar and Creme) and I have no problems.,In the beginning_ my face peeled daily for the first 2-3 months and it was a bit annoying but I continued using it nightly along with Duac during the day. Now I still use it nightly along with Aczone during the day and Doryx pill once a day and my skin is basically clear for the most part. I still get the hormonal pimples but that lasts a week or two and never severe anymore. It just takes time_ but it's worth it when you stick it out. It's best to use a heavier moisturizer as well_ I use Cetaphil Creme twice a day and it's amazing... your skin will be uncomfortable if you put Retin-a-micro on it if it's dry_ so lotion up!,F,22,3  years,1/10/2010Email,Retin-a micro
52, 4, persistent_ moderate acne,redness_ peeling_ flaking_ skin sensitivity_ minor headaches_,i have had persistent_ mild-serious acne since i was 13 y/o.  my dermatologist put me on my first round of accutane back in april of 2008 for 6 months_ but i relapsed after 2 months and started another round in january of 2009 for 7 months.  after another 2 months i relapsed and decided to try topical retin-a micro.  it's true what they say...the side effects_ the flare ups_ the sensitivity and discomfort; HOWEVER_ after 2 months_ i am definitely beginning to see results when i thought it would never come.  you HAVE to stay persistent no matter how embarrassing or uncomfortable your skin gets (but if after 3 months you see NO results_ you should see your dermatologist again).  i'm not 100% clear just yet but i really think another month of retin-a micro applied all over my face at night will get me back to my good ol' accutane days when i didn't have a single bump on my face.  don't get discouraged when you break out even more.  just treat your skin gently_ moisturize_ stay away from the sun_ drink plenty of fluids (green/chamomile tea)_ DO NOT pick your skin AT ALL_ gently exfoliate the dead skin with your fingertips while in the shower_ and wait...the results will come and it's worth it.,M,23,2  months,1/10/2010,Retin-a micro
53, 4, mild acne_ enlarged pores,experienced the worst break outs of my entire life_ red_ flaky_ peeling (similar to the worst sunburn of your life).,I have been working on my skin for over 5 years and have been on everything_ this is the ONLY thing that has really helped. You have to be PATIENT and stick with it_ your acne will get so much worse before it gets better... first 3 months are the hardest I have seen AMAZING results but have a few mild scars.,F,19,4  months,1/7/2010,Retin-a micro
54, 4, hormonal chin acne,burning_ stinging_ alot of flaking and peeling_ redness,I never broke out before and this year_ I was faced with lots of hormonal breakouts. I would get breakouts mainly on my chin and it would take months to go away and would leave heavy scarring. I was so fed up with breaking out so much that my sister recommended retin-a micro. She used that medication when she was going through her breakout phase. I used it and during the first two weeks_ my skin looked awful! I couldn't even go out in public because my skin was so red! I was really depressed and I was about to give up but then I decided to stick it out. It's been about 4 weeks now and my skin around my chin was improved by 50 percent. My red marks are fading slowly and I can't wait to see how it looks like in the next couple of weeks and months. I still have red marks left but they are fading!,F,22,30  days,1/2/2010Email,Retin-a micro
55, 4, mild acne,Only day one! But unlike 99% of the comments on side effects_ I don't feel any burning_ itching_ nor redness. I'm worried I applied too little.. but everyone seems to be saying 'a little goes a long way' so I'm hoping it's just my skin not being too sensitive. I've heard lots of great things about this product and am hoping it'll help me as well (: But I am kind of worried.. why am I not having any side effects?!?!,,F,18,1  days,12/17/2009Email,Retin-a micro
56, 3, acne,redness_ dryness_ burning_ itching_ peeling,I just don't know about this drug... Two weeks into the treatment_ I had the worst break-out of my life. Although it has improved (somewhat)_ it's still not good. PLUS now I have redness and flaky skin. Someone at work came into my office yesterday and said_ 'What happened to your face? It's all red.' So I don't know if that's a real improvement. Of course_ the doctor never warned me that (1) the drug takes a while_ (2) it causes break-outs early-on_ and (3) it's very hard on sensitive skin. (I *have* started using a noncomedogenic moisturizer -- which helps.) I would have waited until AFTER the holidays if I'd known how bad it was going to make me look... I will definitely not feel good about seeing friends and relatives looking like this. So beware.,M,38,4  weeks,12/8/2009,Retin-a micro
