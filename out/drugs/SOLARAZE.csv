0, 4, dry patches on face,Side effects were minimal_ affected areas dryed up and fell off,,M,36,3  weeks,6/25/2007Email,Solaraze
1, 3, precancerous lesions,I can hardly believe that a topically applied gel is causing this stuff_ but it gets better when I quit using it and returns when I do use it....hard to breathe_ lungs feel heavy_ general feeling of sadness_ tiredness_ wanting to quit everything and give up  (SOOOOOO not my personality).  I was blaming my antibiotic for these side effects_ but now I see that they come and go with the use of the solaraze.  Scary.,LEt me be the first to say that I have extremely porous skin_ so I am probably absorbing a higher dose than was thought likely_ I have eczema and take other meds that exfoliate my skin_ so probably a whopping dose is going in.  I have found that I can use a q-tip and just put it on a few spots and then do not get the global bad effect_ so I may do it this way and just treat one arm at a time_ then one leg.,F,51,35  days,6/19/2007,Solaraze
2, 5, AK Therapy,Very little if any!,,M,56,90  days,8/2/2002,Solaraze
