7, 1, High Cholestol (high LDL),Update from first Rating of this Medicine dated:  9/30/2013.  I was taking Lovastatin which is same as Mevacor.  Would like to update readers for their own use:  1.  Stated on 9/30/2012 that I did not feel any relief after 5 days of stopping the medicine.  2.  On the 7th day I had more energy and was feeling better_ as in having my usual alertness and energy back_ not so tired.  3.

Right now_ I'm not taking any medicine and using diet - ground flax seed_ mediterranean diet_ orange juice_ broccoli_ fish_ skinless boneless chicken_ no fried foods_ whole wheat and whole grains_ no processed foods of any kind_ no doughnuts_ muffins_ etc._ to try and see if my LDL will be able to be manageable that way.  IÂ’m also looking into Bile Acid Resins and Fibrates and/or Beta-Sitosterol_ both seem to be a better option.  I have asked for an NMR LipoProfile Test (also known as a Particle Test) from my doctor.  Everyone should have this test done to see if you have small sticky LDL or big fluffy LDL (the big fluffy ones are what you want)_ see www.liposcience.com .

Have made the decision to go off them.  Cholesterol was 204. Dr said to go on them & it only dropped to 178.  Not worth it.  I am too young.  I have had so many blood tests_ MRI & Dr visits with every specialty imaginable_ trying to figure out what is wrong with me.  I recently went on vacation & didn't have them & the difference was stunning!  I felt normal.  I have also been supplementing with CoQ10_ 50 mg per day_ since I came across it 3 months ago.  Migraines are slightly less painful & less frequent only.  No other reduction in symptoms with CoQ10.,Maybe for those in advanced age to help extend or improve life.  However_ Drs are prescribing these things to people younger and younger and the 40 year effects of taking these things have NOT been ascertained_ nor have the effects on younger people been adequately ascertained.

After that assignment was completed_ I went back to my regular work routine of two or three hours per day and 8-9 hours of sleep_ however the symptoms did not abate and got progressively worse. After two weeks_ I knew something well out of the ordinary was happening to me and the only logical conclusion was that because I was not doing anything else differently_ it had to be the drug. I called a friend whom I knew was taking statins and asked him if he had experienced any side effects similar to mine.  He said that except for severe muscle damage that he experienced_ I could have been describing his symptoms.  His doctor told him it was undoubtedly the statin and took him off.

I've always had a sharp mind and was not taking any other medication so I knew it was the mevacor. I've since read that all statins have this side effect and that drug companies hid the side effect data when the FDA approved statins for human use. I was forgetting critical information at work and was scared that I was developing early dementia. The symptoms stopped within a week of stopping the mevacor. But my doctor still wants to try me on another statin. They say memory problems are rare-tell that to the executive who kept taking a statin for 2 years while his memory got so bad that he lost his job. The problem didn't reverse like mine after stopping the drug.

My father_ athletic_ healthy male who worked out daily at the gym_ went to the doctor for first time just for a physical when he turned 64 years of age. Doctor placed him on lovastatin. Within weeks he had weakness in legs_ problems with back_ would run into walls_ lose balance. After 6 months developed dry eye. When he visited doctor_ and explained doctor said it was from 'aging'. My father must have aged 30 years in 6 months. He is now (after three years_ 2 of those years on lovastatin) unable to leave the house on his own and can not drive. I had to move back with him to watch him. In the last two weeks I witnessed him take two very bad falls_ and he couldnt get up without my help. He has been taking coq10 in high doses due to what i've read on the internet. It seems to have seriously improved him but still he has the above symptoms. This drug changed our lives for good.

I must be careful and watch my liver function number because niacin as well as the red yeast rice puts a strain on the liver.

68, 3, Elevated Cholesterol,..A GUIDE TO LOWERING CHOLESTEROL FOR THOSE WITH BAD REACTIONS TO STATINS DRUGS SUCH AS MEVACOR AND LIPITOR_ etc.. ...Write me if you have questions.. I commented on this page before. I had great success with Red Yeast Rice (also known as Lovastatin brand name Mevacor)lowering my total cholesterol from 244 to 168 with my HDL 40. My orig numers were 244 w/HDL 62. But there were side effects and my HDL had dropped 22.,I stopped and tried beta sterols_ oatmeal_ loss 10 lbs_ kept up the exercise (best I could)_ fish oil 2 pills total EPA 530mg and 1000mg niacin extended release but my numbers were total 225 w/HDL 53. Thats a little progress but I need more. I have increased my niacin to 1200 mg (600 before bed and 600 in the morning) and started taking Red Yeast Rice again but half a pill therefor 5.2 monacolins but my neck has started to tighten up and crack with headaches. I'm taking one day off RYR and tom I take only 1/4 a pill for 2.6 monacolins. I mean Advicor is niacin extended relase and Lovastatin and it comes in quantities starting at 500mg extended release niacin and 20 mg lovastatin. I'm well within the lowest amount so what gives. I'm upping my fish oil to 5 to 6 pills for an EPA of 1100-1350 mg. I had been taking 6 pills fish oil before my first test (HDL 62) but had stopped before my second test (HDL 40).My goal is Total under 200_ HDL minimum 75 and LDL under 125 hopefully close to 100,M,49,7  days,11/6/2007Email,Mevacor

72, 4, Cholesterol,Neck stiffness_ neck pain_ neck muscles felt as thought they were going to freeze up and crack. Heaviness in chest. Lack of ambition. Seemed to be losing muscle mass. Struggled in my running.,I took Red Yeast Rice extended release with 10.2 mg monocolins (Lovastatin or brand name Mevacor). I had great success lowering my cholesterol from 245 to 165 but had bad side effects as I listed. I then started taking 100 mg CoQ10 daily and symptoms lessened. I then cut the pill in half (cut my dose in half) and all symptoms went away. I then started taking a beta sterol 15 minutes before each meal (total beta sterol a day between 3 and 4 grams). I started taking fish oil and cod liver oil also preceded by 1 beta sterol. Beta sterol is believed to compete with cholesterol within the digestive track for uptake. Lastly_ I take CLA (another fatty acid just as fish oil has fatty acids DHA and EPA). The CLA is helping me drop fat and hopefully gain muscle. I head to the Dr's next week to check my blood levels. If I keep below 200 total with HDL above 65 and LDL below 120 then I'll be happy - and of course my triglycerides too.,M,49,4  months,8/1/2007,Mevacor

77, 4, High Choles (244 - Red Yeast Rice),This works_ I guarantee. I make this entry on this site to educate. I'll be short. Mevacor is the brand name. Lovastatin is the generic name. Red Yeast Rice contains lovastatin - or known by monacolin-K when in Red Yeast Rice. Along with monacolin-k there are monacolin-1_2_3_4_5_6 and a beta sterostol. With RYR these work synergistically to lower cholesterol with an amount (mg) less than that used for same cholestrol lower effect as Mevacor. Therefor_ with 10 gm of RYR monacolin you get the effect of about 15 mg of Mevacor. It not only uses less but it spreads out the load rather than targeting a single receptor thus putting a far lesser load on the liver. I lowered my cholesterol from 244 to 195 and elevated HDL from 63 to 70. Now I'll mix in walnuts and oatmeal and continue working out.,People jump into statins - DON'T. Start with say 5 mg for 2 weeks and then 10 mg for 2 and then 15 mg. The rule will be that 10 mg will lower overall cholestrol by about 23%. Adding another 10 mg to 20 mg doesn't mean you'll lower it 46% - it will be more like 28%. By slowly starting off on it you will help avoid the problems. And_ I guarantee most the people here with problems are boozing it. Cut back to maybe 1 glass a wine on 3 day per week. I drank too much once and boy did I pay for it. And I tried taking it before and stopped due to problems. THis time I took it slowly and cut back on the booze and all is good. Initially I felt tired and a little heavy in the chest. but that is all gone. And rememeber to take 30 mg CoQ10 per day to replace what lovastatin removes.,M,48,2  months,6/4/2007Email,Mevacor

I stopped taking the statin on my own [Dr. was out of town] and had significant lessening of the pain after 2 days. The pain was completely gone after 10 days. I kept a daily log.,I often woke up with arm numbness that went away after a minute or so being awake. I attributed it to sleeping on my arm. The numbness has not happened since I stopped Lovastatin. The caution sheets given to patients call side effects very rare. I doubt that_ as a friend's Dr told him leg pains occur in 25% of patients.I lost some weight and saw a dietician since stopping Lovastatin. I'd rather lower LDL this way.

One liver enzyme was five TIMES normal after 1 year on lovastatin.,We didn't realize what was going on until he stopped taking it.  All of the symptoms_ I'm happy to report_ went away after being off the medication for one month.,M,70,1  years,11/7/2005,Mevacor
97, 3, cholesterol,After about one year on Mevacor_ experienced symmetrical pain in fingers and toes (each finger and each toe simultaneously)_ as well as elbows_ knees.  Wake up tired and sore; ready to go back to bed.  Upon awakening_ difficult to walk.  After a few hours_ easier to walk_ move hands_ but low level of joint pain persists 24/7.  Some,My doctor stopped the Rx just 3.5 days ago_ thinking it may be the cause of the athralgia and myalgia - fancy names for sore bones and joints! (smile) Waiting for improvement in aches and pains. Will keep you posted.,F,51,1  years,8/7/2005,Mevacor

Pain in sides and chest.,I am going to try policosanol instead; has anyone had success with that? also_ I've heard that sugar cane-derived is superior_ but I wonder if anyone else knows much about that distinction.(also_ I don't even know my numbers with Mevacor_ but it doesn't really matter to me---I can't tolerate these side effects anymore),F,47,4  months,8/7/2005,Mevacor

101, 1, hc,Pain began in hand and finger joints_ then moved to lower leg muscles and slowly traveled up legs to right hip.Unable to get into car without lifting second leg in. Unable to stand w/o pushing up from table. Unable to go on stairway w/o gripping rail. Went to physical therapist and told I was getting old. Told to exercise more to gain muscle strength although my job requires that I stand in a 1st grade classroom all day.Went off and within 5 days was able to walk_ climb stairs and get into a car. Told principal...she suffers same symptoms. She went off 4 days ago and now is able to walk where before she felt,Investigate when your symptoms occur. Don't take,F,52,18  months,5/25/2005,Mevacor
102, 1, High Cholesterol,Emense constant muscle tightness in both thighs_ biceps_ underarms_ and calfs. The tightness in my thighs are as big as a cantelope. Muscle weakness_ fatigue_ concentration level low. I feel tired all the time and have a hard time walking. This is not my normal routine. I stopped taking my mevacor  four days ago and have noticed the hardness in my thighs are decreasing. I can't wait to feel better. This drug is not for me.,I took Zocor for about 2 years and had muscle pain and cosmic pains in my thighs. I thought I had some weird degenerating disease. On Mevacor the muscle pain is worse for me. I stopped taking Zorcor for one year and I felt great. Of course_ my cholesterol level went back up to 286. I am now doing yoga and watching my diet_ this is a much better plan than taking these drugs. I can say that taking Zorcor for me the muscle pain was much less than Mevacor_ but my Kaiser Dr. would not give me Zocor_ she said it was too expensive and not on their business plan.
