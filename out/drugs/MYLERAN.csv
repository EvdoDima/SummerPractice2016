0, 3, high platelets_ myelofibrosis,Just started on Dec. 28. Was taking hydrea but had tongue bumps so was put on myleran to see if tongue bumps would go away and to see if the bumps would not go away that would show the bumps were part of my disease. The bumps are slightly smaller so hopefully they will go away and I can be put back on hydrea for awhile until the bumps start coming back. And probably go back & forth with both medications.  That is only my opinion and only time will tell.,myleran is more leukemic so I am a little bit concerned but I have no other choice at this time.,F,80,41  days,2/7/2005Email,Myleran
