0, 3, Period pain,I used to take this for severe period pain. It worked for the first few years but after a while it stopped working. I decided not to take it for period pains anymore_ and at first it felt awful having no pain killers_ but now I no longer have period cramps_ after 10 years of having severe cramps. So it will work...at first_ but then it just stopped having it's effectiveness. Quitting it made me no longer get pain for periods. The bad news is you have to quit for at least 8 months before the pain starts to go away but once it's gone_ it's gone.I don't reccommend taking this long term as it can cause stomach pain and ulcers. It also masks the real problem. Only take it if you literally have to like if you have a fever_ but try ice for pain_ otherwise advil will just stop working eventually. I used to take 800mg for 2 days for my period pain_ sometimes more_ and that is just way too much_ because it had barely any effect.,,F,,2  days400mg 2X D,7/3/2016Email,Advil

2, 4, Pain relief_ fever reducer,I used to take Advil all the time with no problems -- this issue began VERY suddenly and severely. Every time I take this drug now_ within the hour_ my nose will start POURING uncontrollably like water -- both in consistency and color_ which signals to me an allergic reaction. (The immune system will do whatever it feels necessary to flush an allergen.) It was to such excess that I could feel fluid pressing against my eardrums_ coming up into my eyes_ causing extreme amounts of pressure inside my head in all directions to the point where I honestly questioned if my sinuses were going to burst. I went through an entire new box of tissues from this in one sitting. This would all be bad enough_ but it additionally made my heart race to an insane degree...and I have heart issues to begin with. I count myself lucky that it didn't trigger a heart attack or anything. I assume my blood pressure was skyhigh as well_ as I could hear my pulse in my ears. All the excess fluid draining down the bac,I hate that I can't take Advil anymore -- I used to take it as my go-to drug for pain_ fevers_ you name it. And it was often the ONLY thing that adequately helped.,F,30,20  years 1X AN,6/11/2015Email,Advil

It progressed over the next few months so badly that I couldn't even leave my house because of the pain in my stomach and the blood was constantly coming out so I had to have a colonoscopy. They discovered I had developed ulcerative colitis. I never related that to the advil but then found myself have bad flare-ups everytime I took ibuprofen or advil_ so I had to stop taking it and just try to deal with my back pain and headaches when they occur.,F,27, 400mg 1X D,8/4/2011Email,Advil

30, 2, For muscle aches and pains,Advil is the very likely cause of my bowel obstruction_ which generated extreme pain and discomfort after I ate.  One of the episodes caused me to go to the emergency room and resulted in a three day hospitalization.  I have had laparoscopic surgery and will likely require further_ more extensive surgery to resolve the blockage.The first three GI docs said there was no known cause for abdominal blockages such as I had_ but my fourth GI doc said Advil and other ibuprofen anti-inflamatories can cause diaphragm blockages within the colon.,Other people I know_ including my wife_ take Advil without any problems or issues whatsoever.  I did not make the connection to my abdominal issue to the Advil because I took it a couple hours before dinner and before the severe pain / blockage occured.  I can not tell folks not to take Advil_ but I would be cautious since the side effects for people who are sensitive to it can require hospitalization and surgery.  And abdominal surgery takes a lot longer to recover from than I expected.,M,55,  1X D,11/22/2010,Advil

33, 1, For severe headache pressure I got,Developed stomach problems and difficult breathing the day I started to take it. I caught a cold the day before so I didn't think Advil was causing my trouble breathing. I was more focused on stopping my terrible headache. I notice my stomach rumbling and notice I couldn't finish half my meal(I usually eat a ton and could eat double that size meal before). The next day morning I took another advil and my stomach just wouldn't stop aching so then I finally looked at the advil bottle label.,My painful stomach aches lasted 48 hours after I stopped taking Advil. I also seemed to develop an allergic reaction to Advil which caused my difficult breathing which is labeled as the allergic symptom of asthma listed on the Advil label. I have never had asthma in my life as well but Advil caused it. I only took about 5-6 Advil pills in 1.5days and it messed me up bad. I will never take it again and will stick with Tylenol,M,22,1.5  days 4X D,5/11/2010,Advil

50, 5, recovering from sprained ankle,After an episode several years ago where I had a sudden on-set of a severe allergic reaction (asthma_ rash_ and stuffed nose) which my doctor attributed to a Advil_ I was told not to ever take Advil again.  Prior to that_ I had taken Advil regularly for sports related injuries.  Recently_ I sprained my ankle and a different doctor said that I could probably try Advil again so I began taking it again.  I was fine for several months of taking high dosages (800mg) of Advil at least once a day_ but then I started getting a stuffy nose a couple hours of taking the Advil_ which I attributed to my regular allergies.  Then finally_ I got to the point where I was having full on allergic reactions_ where my ears were stuffed_ my eyes were watering_ and my nose was completely stuffed.  When I finally suspected that it was the Advil causing this_ I tested my theory a few times and sure enough_ it was the Advil.
