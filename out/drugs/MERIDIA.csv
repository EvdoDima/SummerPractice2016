0, 2, Obesity,Meridia caused me to have new obsessive thoughts about food. I would fixate on a certain food and be unable to get it out of my mind until I ate it. I was also unable to reach sexual climax. It generally dulled all of my emotions. It slightly increased my already elevated blood pressure. It did not significantly reduce my appetite.,Taking Meridia was a worthless endeavor for me. My doctor recommended it to me because she felt it was safer than Phentermine which worked much better for me for appetite reduction.,F,27,6  months,7/2/2015,Meridia

3, 3, weight loss,Pupils dilated_ dizzy when walking_ confusion_ everything looked brighter_ anxious_ light headed.,After taking my first Meridia pill_ I felt fine for most of the day. It wasn't until about 10pm that I began feeling dizzy. When I sat up I felt extremely dizzy and I'm certain I blanked out for a while. When I sat back up_ after what I thought was just from being tired_ I went to get a glass of water and I fell straight to the ground. I was able to pick myself up but everything was spinning and everything looked a little brighter. I was a little worried_ I noticed my pupils when I went to wash my face before bed_ they were huge. For hours they stayed like this and I couldn't sleep. I still haven't slept and I'm not tired at all. At around 7am I noticed that my weight was less than before I took the pill_ even so_ I definitely won't be taking this pill again and I don't recommend it.,F,18,1  days15mg 1X D,1/2/2012,Meridia
4, 1, Weight loss,I took this medication several years ago when it first came out so I don't remember the dosage amount but I had to share my experience.  I was given the drug by my PCP with the hopes that it would reduce my weight.  It did.  However_  it also had HORRIBLE side effects.  The drug caused the entire bottom half of my body to go numb.  I couldn't walk and had to go to the ER.  I was immediately admitted because they completed several nerve tests on me and I failed all of them.  I was in the hospital for 5 days.  I had a cat scan_ 2 MRI's and was seen by 5 neurologists.They finally told me that they thought I had the begining stages of MS.  I freaked out.  I was 22 years old and couldn't believe what I was hearing.  I was discharged from the hospital after 5 days and my mom found another neuologist to review my case.  He did research and told me to stop taking the Meridia because he had a hunch that it was causing the problems.  Within 4 days of stopping the meds I was fine.  Beware of this,,F,31,90  days 1X D,10/16/2011Email,Meridia

I was taking a otc diet pill for 3 months until it was taken off the market by FDA for having ""significant amounts of sibutramine in it"". Totally illegal but it was the most effective diet pill/anti depressant i have ever used! I lost 15lbs within the first 2 months_ my BF% was 17!!

6, 5, To Lose Weight,Mild Shortness of Breathe at times_ increased heart rate_ mild constipation_ and insomnia,I love it. I have been on Meridia for a little over 2 months now. I lost 7 pounds during the first month and 5 pounds during the second month on 10mg daily of Meridia. I'm increasing my dosage to 15mg and hope to continue to watch the weight fall off simply by eating way less than before. No exercise at all.

7, 2, 50lb weight gain after hysterectomy,Horrible dry mouth_ racing heart_ very fast pulse_ jittery_ spacey and anxious.,I was at my wits end with a 50 lb weight gain following a hysterectomy.  Nothing I did helped me loose weight.  My Dr suggested meridia. I started with 10mg_ lost 5 pounds the first week and then 5 the next_ then I hit a plateau.  After a month my dr prescribed 15mg meridia.  I haven't lost any more weight in spite of a healthy diet and exercise. My side effects have worsened and I don't feel good daily.  I am weaning off the meridia and will not take it.  The way I feel is not worth it.,F,49,6  weeks15mg 1X D,9/1/2010Email,Meridia
8, 5, weight and cholesterol problems,I have had no side effects from Meridia,I asked my doctor to put me on this because I come from a family of heart disease and my weight and cholesterol numbers where out of control.  I'm not sure at this point what my total weight loss is but my old clothes are very big.  The plus side of this for me is that my cholesterol dropped over 100 points and the good and bad are back in balance.  That is a huge advantage for me.,F,47,3  months15 mg 1X D,8/21/2010,Meridia
9, 5, weight loss,Constipation,Been taking Meridia for 6 weeks now. Went to the Doctor to get weighed and surprisingly I lost 33 lbs. I was amazed. What Meridia has done for me was take away the necessity to over eat. I stop when I'm not hungry now as opposed to stopping when I'm full. The only time I weigh myself is when I go to the doctr who is monitoring me every 6 weeks. Meridia has been absolutely wonderful for me!,F,42,6  weeks10 1X D,7/26/2010,Meridia

No other side effects to speak of.,"I wasn't going to post until I had been taking this a while_ but the first 3-5 days seem to be when everyone is affected one way or another. First day_ felt a little wierd ""spacey""? No decrease in appetite. Second day_ still felt a little spacey with mild dry mouth. Day 3 felt great_ but had the dry mouth. No headaches to note. Day 3 woke up with ZERO appetite AND zero interest in smoking. Day 4 Feel great_ a little munchy in the evening_ but that is due to taking it so early in the AM.  Today_ day 5_ constipated_ but already had that problem prior to Meridia Rx due to thyroid problems. Hope this keeps up_ was very very worried about the side effects!

13, 5, weight loss,Meridia has changed my life!! I have lost about 35 pounds in a little over 3 months.  I changed my eating but I am not following a set plan.  I am just eating the right things and ONLY when I am hungry.  I am not deprieving myself of a once in a while treat.  If I want to have 1 of my kids cookies I have ONE.  I feel like I am eating like a normal person.  I also did not increase my activity level_ although I am pretty active already.  I plan to start back at the gym in the next week or 2 as my schedule frees up so that I can burn more calories.  The best part for me is that I AM NEVER EVER HUNGRY!! The only meal that I cannot miss is lunch. Otherwise I have to force myslef to eat dinner some nights. And late night snacks are almost a thing of the past.  I just called my Dr this week to tell her the news and get a refill and she was screaming for me on the phone! She said that the drug is safe and I should continue to take it.

16, 5, Weight loss,head-ache(aleve works for this)_ increased thirst_ decreased hunger,My doc started me out for the first 10 days with 5mg to make sure I didn't have any adverse effects_ I have been taking 10mg for the past 5 days.  I can definitely feel the difference with 10mg - and so far I feel good except for minor head-ache.  It is really helping me not to snack between meals and so far I am able to stick to a 1200-1400 calorie diet without hunger. Meridia definitely helps! One tip though; if you aren't on a structured diet program or keeping a food journal and exercising you're fooling yourself!,F,32,2  weeks10 mg 1X D,5/21/2010,Meridia
17, 5, Obesity; Get pregnant in a year,The first week: Jittery for first 3 days_ slight dry mouth_ thirsty_ minor joint pain for first 2 days_ a few headaches here and there (have since gone away)_ and slightly irritable first few days. Second week: None.,Meridia has been a miracle for me. I weighed 209 lbs on Day 1. A week later_ I got on the scale and to my surprise it said 204 lbs! What I did: The day I began Meridia_ I started a healthy diet - no more than 1200 calories a day & stopped the ice cream habit. I walk more now_ but I still have no real exercise routine. I no longer eat fatty and greasy foods. I love Meridia because I feel less hungry and eat much smaller meals. For example_ I can eat a Lean Cuisine at lunch and feel full. The only thing is_ I tend to get hungrier at night. So_ I started taking Meridia an hour later than usual and I've been less hungry at night. Personally_ it's harder for me to lose weight than the average person because I have hypothyroidism --  no thyroid to control my metabolism. (I take 225 mcg of Levothyroxine.) I have been struggling with my weight since I was 21_ when I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism.  My endocrinologist prescribed Meridia for me because I told her that I am unhappy with my weight_ fearful I will get gestational diabetes if I get pregnant again_ and don't want to risk the chance of becoming diabetic in the future. Ironically_ because I had gestational diabetes_ I was put on a diet (2_300 calories a day) during my pregnancy_ and did not gain a pound. As a result_ I lost 20 lbs after having my son. Now_ after almost a year and a half later_ Ive gained a total of 13 lbs_ slowly heading back up to my pre-pregnancy weight of 216 lbs.

18, 5, over weight,During the first two weeks_ a little dry mouth. Nothing severe. No real bad side effcts. The cost is $183 per month and for me_ since I was only 33lbs over_ it's x 6 months. Six months is what it will take for me to hit my BMI. You may be different-consult your doctor. If you have a desire to get back in shape_ go for it_ spend the money. If you don't have the money_ stay away from Meridia_ because all you'll do is complain it doesn't work. I'm living proof it does though. You have to excercise--don't expect the weight to fall off without some effort. Do you want to get back in shape? Follow the program_ excercise. I rode a bicycle 125 miles per week_ took meridia_ watched my food consumption_ and watched my body changed back to a normal physique. If you are looking for approx cost-Doctor visits_ physical_ blood work_ x 6 months =  APPROX $1800.00  If you add your excercise into it_ then that is your time-you'll have to price that.Total benefit-PRICELESS.,"On 3-3-10 I weighed 203 lbs. On 5-14-10 I weighed in at 179 lbs. I've lost 24 lbs so far. My correct BMI is 169 lbs. I've been on almost three months supply of 15mg capsules_ one each day. It helps control appetite and gives an appreciation for what you eat. The drug blocks sensors in the brain so you don't have the ""hungry"" feeling. I have 10 lbs to loose in the next 2 months_ stepping down to 10mg capsules and then finally to 5mg capsules. What accelerated my weight loss was 1000 miles of cycling since I started the drug. Excercise and the weight will drop. Cut caloric intake to 1000-1200 calories per day_ eat nothing fried_ and this pulls your health back to the teenage years. At age 50 now_ I've resumed control of my weight_ can fit in medium shirts_ and feel the best I've ever felt. No pot belly. Great feeling. Lost it. I do not have heartburn any longer. Began the program on March 3rd 2010 consuming 1 capsule each 15mg per day. Three months of this. The fourth upcoming month is 15 mg supply. The fifth month will be reduced to 10mg. The final month is a 5mg supply. Also-the heartburn is gone due to the weight dropping-I use to have to take one zantac per day-no more zantac!",M,50,90  days15mg 1X D,5/14/2010,Meridia

20, 5, for weightloss,I have been quite lucky not many side effects. I have noticed I drink a lot more which can only be a good thing and only this last week I have had trouble sleeping,It has only been a positive experience for me I could not have lost this amount of weight with out it . I have lost 32 lbs in 7 weeks with not much effort. I have nt excercised a lot . The drug will really work. I have found I dont have much appetite_ I dont snack_ I eat much smaller meals and feel full.There have been times when I get really hungry and its usually in the evening so I changed my diet after 3 days to not eat so much in the day_ and save my calories for the night and that has been nothing short of a miracle because now I dont get hungry in the day I just eat in the evening and its working for me. I have another 20lbs to go and its been the easiest 7 weeks of my life. I read someone say its not a miracle_ pill well i think it is if you adjust your lifestyle for it as I did . I would recomend anyone that is taking this drug that gets hungry at night as I did_ to just eat minimum in the day and save your calories for the night . I worried at first that I was eating to late and going to bed therefor_ I would not lose weight  well I am living proof_ 32lbs in 7 weeks is a huge amount to lose and I feel great and my doctor says im doing great .So good luck and I hope it works for you as it has for me,F,45,7  weeks15mg 1X D,3/26/2010,Meridia

22, 4, weight loss,irritable_ heart palpitations?_ seemed more thirsty_ insomnia_,"Noticed irritability after a few weeks of being on it. I needed to cut my anti-depressant in half_ due to serotonin syndrome.(extremely cold feeling_after taking anti-depressant_ since cutting the dose in half_ that ""cold feeling"" went away.) Noticed right away how ""not hungry"" I felt. And when I did eat_ I felt fuller faster with less food. Almost felt like stomach was upset the first couple of days of using Meridia. I reduced my calorie intake to take advantage of the not ""starved"" feeling you get with just dieting alone. I lost 22lbs. Very happy with that. I went off of it to give myself a break for about a week to see if irritablity improved. It seemed to. I have since resumed the Meridia_ and for some reason I don't feel so irritable. I do drink more water and that is a good thing for me. I especially notice I'm thirsty when I first get up and drink water. I take the Meridia in the morning. Other than the heart palpitations_ which I will keep an eye on_ I like how much easier it is to stick to a low cal diet and do low-key exercising (back problems) Energy level is better_ I think due in part to healthier eating and weight loss too.",F,48,45  days10 mg 1X D,3/19/2010Email,Meridia
23, 5, Weight Loss,The first week experienced dry mouth.  This was actually helpful for me as I needed to increase my water consumption.  I think the key to this drug working is really water consumption.  I tend to lose more pounds each week when I maintain at least 44 oz. of water daily than when I dont.  Haven't experienced any other side effects for the duration that I have been on this.,I have lost 53 pounds in the course of six months WITHOUT incorporating any exercise.  I have watched the type of foods that I eat and total caloric consumption under 1300 calories.  I would suggest this to anyone who is serious about losing weight and have been unsuccessful in the past.  I think the side effects depend on the individual person however I haven't had any issues at all.  I am very pleased with the results and will continue taking to drop the last 20 pounds to reach my goal.,F,34,6  months10 mg 1X D,3/9/2010Email,Meridia

I walk every day_ and can do up to 4km in 30 minutes on my lunch hour.  I would recommend this to help anyone in need of weight loss. One thing_ I do recommend_ do not take any other medication while on this drug. I think that is the key to making this drug work to its fullest potential.,F,41,9  months10mg-15mg 1X D,3/6/2010Email,Meridia

26, 4, weight loss,elevated blood pressure but not HIGH blood pressure_ insomnia the first few days but went away,This drug is helpful_ IF you are willing to exercise_ watch what you eat and ultimately change your patterns.  I have lost about 18 pounds in 7 weeks.  It is NOT the miracle pill...NOTHING is...I still get hungry.  But if you are conscious about WHAT YOU THINK and WHAT YOU FEEL while you are on this medication_ you might just change your life.  I have worked out and watched what I eat my whole life.  About a year and a half ago_ I was sidelined with a foot and knee injury which made working out consistently a real challenge_ and I gained about 20 pounds.  I was frustrated that diet and moderate exercise would not move the scale.  My DR prescribed Meridia_ knowing that it was a short term fix while I re-habbed my injuries. Losing weight quickly has taken pressure off my foot and knee injury_ allowing me to workout harder.  When I finish re-habbing my knee and foot_ I will most likely go off this medication and continue with the healthy eating habits I've solidified during the time I've been on the drug. I did have trouble sleeping the first few nights but it subsided after a couple of days.,M,42,7  weeks,1/24/2010,Meridia

30, 4, Obese,I take the pill (15mg) in the morning with 2-3 cups of water. I sometimes feel that my stomach is up in my throat; hence_ that is why I consume water with the pill to ease that sensation of feeling as if I am going to vomit. Sometimes I feel light headed and very thirsty throughout the day (a dry throat and mouth).,I find that I don't feel the need to snack between meals. I also do not find myself as hungry during the day. However_ at night I sometimes become hungry. (Maybe because the medicine is wearing off). I have a newborn baby_ and was suffering from symptoms of PPd and this has helped that subside. The reason I decided to take this medicine_ was to aid my over snacking issues_ to aid me with my diet and exercise plan of losing the extra weight I have gained. Something else to note is that I have chosen to not weigh myself until I have been on the drug for 1.5 months. I don't want to get caught up in numbers! I feel good at any rate.,F,26,3  weeks,11/28/2009Email,Meridia

I got it primarily for weight loss and to control my crazy eating.  I gained 60 pounds when I was pregnant and was only able to lose 45.  Nothing else was working.  I have been dealing with severe depression and surprisingly_ I feel more emotionally stable and in control when on this pill.

I am eating about half the amount of food I ate before going on meridia.  I follow canada food rules with a limit on the no. of carbs. I eat healthy_ lots of veggies and fruit_ and we hardly ever eat out because it is too tempting to cheat. I am taking some sleeping pills_ but they have their own set of side effects.

36, 5, To combat excessive hunger,Dry mouth_ insomnia for the first week_ racing pulse from time to time.,This drug started working 4 hours after I took it_ however the 10 mg lost effectiveness after 4 weeks and I switched to the 15 mg which is working fine with no decrease in effect so far. Although I am not obese_ I was close to 50 lbs overweight due to almost constant hunger. I have always had a huge appetite and routinely ate more than my husband who outweighs me by almost 100 lbs. I could not go more than 2 hours after eating without others being able to hear my stomach growling and I was totally preoccupied with what I was going to eat next. Meridia has put a stop to all that. I eat when I'm hungry_ making healthy choices when possible_ and stop when I'm full (I never in my life stopped when I was full). I also rarely eat after supper now_ rather than having 2 suppers at 6 and 10 p.m. I have lost 12 lbs in 7 weeks but 8 of those have been in the past 3 weeks on the 15 mg dosage.,F,35,7  weeks,9/26/2009,Meridia

I need to lose about 80lbs. Very sad when I used to be a size 5 in 1995! Already had high BP and Cholest. Dry mouth was pretty bad and after reading other posts I will now assume I have bad breath. Wonderful_now I'm fat and smelly. Had some pretty intense sweating like a linebacker. Usually try to walk two miles everyday but last two weeks my energy has been very low and I am again struggling. BUT-This medicine is amazing because food does not rule my life. Feel normal again. I get hungry. I eat. Then move on with my life. I don't know how this medicine works. Actually_ no food turns me on-not even my favorite. I get hungry but can't figure out what I am hungry for. Grocery shopping for myself and my daughter is a challenge because nothing appeals to me. It seems to work best when I take just after waking in the morning with a full glass of water.

As for appetite control_ I think it is working to a point_ however I do believe someone like myself who eats ""just to eat"" will have to convince themselves simply NOT to eat verses the pill turning you off food. In other words_ I eat most of the time without being ""hungry"" but taking the pill makes me think_ ""hey I'm taking this med_ I should not eat that right now...."" The side effects are mild at this time. I will continue the 10mg pill and see what happens. If the side effects continue or worsen I will likely stop taking it.

43, 2, weight loss,digestive issues_ dry mouth,"Although Meridia helped me to lose weight by making me feel full rather quickly_ I had terrible issues digestively.  It took about 3 weeks to notice a 'pressure' in my chest behind my sternum.  I thought at first it may be cardiac related_ but began having a ""peculiar noise"" at times upon swallowing accompanied with a slight sensation of my esophagus feeling smaller as I swallowed certain foods.  My internist sent me for a barium swallow and was diagnosed with a hiatal hernia (which many people my age have) but along with the hernia I had ""severe"" reflux.  That's what was causing the 'pressure' @ night.  I went off of Meridia for about 3 weeks to see if things cleared up.  It did to a point.  Upon continuing Meridia again_ the problem again returned_ even worse.  I know digestive problems aren't experienced by most who use Meridia_.....but I am one of the few who did.

Here is all that I would like to say: We are overweight and would like to LOSE weight.  If we LOSE enough weight_ our clothes may become too large and feel LOOSE.  We do not ""loose"" weight (with any luck).  We attempt to LOSE WEIGHT and make our fat clothes too LOOSE.

48, 3, Weight Loss,No side effects. New to the drug.,A competitive gymnast_ I never had a weight issue until gaining during two pregnancies. I've tried everything to naturally lose the weight: Atkins_ calorie counting (800-1000 cals.)_ a personal trainer 2HRS/5 days/week...nothing worked; I stuck to every program at least 6 months. Overweight now for 9 years despite a mostly organic_ vegetarian_ very low cal. diet_ daily exercise & an active life. I weigh 178lbs. at 5 feet tall_ am a size 12/14. Hormones and chemicals tested and normal; history of anemia; possibly have Fibromyalgia related to sleep disorders; in the last two years I've had symptoms thought to be related to gallbladder but tests were normal. Today_ before beginning Meridia_ my resting heart rate was 68; blood pressure 115/65. I've been concerned since Meridia's primary affect is appetite supression; weighing that against possible long term side affects_ since appetite is not an issue for me. After reading_ I'm willing to give it a shot. I should not weight more than 100-120 lbs.; meaning I should lose about 55-70 lbs. stopping when I've reached a healthy comfortable weight.

49, 3, weight loss,Waking up easily_ dry mouth_ constipation_ increased energy,When I started I was 155lbs and I wanted to weigh 120.  My doctor started me on a 5mg dose as a test.  She warned me about all the dangerous side effects so I was nervous to start taking it because 30lbs wasn't worth any heart problems.  Rather than taking 2 pills every day I started taking one pill every other day and I believe it helped me limit my portions and choose the right foods.  In the beginning though_ even if I was taking the pill_ if I really wanted something (a piece of pie)_ I would eat it and eat it all.  Also_ if I was drinking then I would just eat a little bit of everything which adds up. I didn't want to risk going through such drastic measures like taking a pill and STILL fail so I started calorie counting and writing down everything.  I started walking my dog 2x/day and jogging on my treadmill about 4x/week.  I think the pill helped me make better decisions and I no longer minded having an egg white omelet instead of a regular omlette with a muffin and orange juice. I stopped snacking at my desk - I chew gum instead.  I stopped going out to eat and told my husband that until I lose weight he can eat what I eat or he's on his own for dinner.  When it got to the point that there was a noticeable difference_ I stopped taking the pill.  I'm already in the habit of knowing what I should eat_ how much to eat and when to eat.  It's easy for me to refuse food that would otherwise be tempting since I now know first hand that just eating less works and that piece o,F,27,30  days,7/2/2009,Meridia

So far I've lost about 4 lbs.  I have noticed that it definately curbs me from eating huge portions.  I have noticed a little of the insomnia - not a problem going to sleep_ but problem going back to sleep if I get woken up.  I don't feel jittery or spacey - if anything I think it's actually calmed a little of my anxiety/nervousness that I feel when I get stressed.  Things just don't seem to get me overly worked up like they used to - but I don't feel like I'm sedated/numb either.  So far I like it and really hope to see some results in the next few weeks or at least by the time summer is here.

82, 4, Weight Loss,Constipation_ Headache_ Moodiness (erratic moods)_ Insomnia,First_ I really want to make something clear for everyone: Meridia is NOT an appetite suppressant! It really scares me to think people are taking drugs that they have not researched--you have to be careful with your body and what you put into it.  Meridia works on the part of your brain that makes you feel satisfied_ not the part that makes you hungry or not.You will still be hungry however for most people the craving for junk food and excessive thoughts about eating are lessened. Plus_ you feel full and satisfied faster and for a longer span of time.I was on Meridia last year for a few months and had amazing results_ however I realized that I wasn't eating nearly enough (600-700 calories plus working out for 2 hours a day). Anorexia is not a healthy or long term weight loss strategy!  I had already lost about 80 lbs on my own (you gotta eat healthy and move move move!) and was using Meridia only after hitting a major plateau (with about 40 lbs left to lose).  Meridia makes it too ea,F,32,10  months,10/15/2008Email,Meridia

It's a hard drug to take because you feel a little weird all the time.  I have always exercised  every day and just eat much smaller portions.  Heartbeat is about ten beats higher than normal while exercising. Need  to take sleep aids. It's worth it.,F,55,11  days,10/14/2008,Meridia
84, 5, weight Loss,Dry mouth_ joint pain_ rapid heart beat and a bit of insomina.,Well I do have dry mouth but seems I did before anyway. As for the joint pains they arent that bad. The rapid heart beats are only when I dont eat much or when I take a dose on an empty stomach. As for sleep I find that if I take my pill early in the morning. I get a great night tsleep and wake up early well reasted at like 5 or 6 am. So it is a win win for me. So far I have lost 25 lbs. Almost a pound per day. Definatly worth the tempoary side affects.,M,41,30  days,10/13/2008Email,Meridia
85, 2, weight loss,very fast heartbeat and elevated blood pressure to scary levels --- always had low bp but has been at hypertension levels in the 2 months I've taken this,This has not helped my appetite at all_ and I have not lost any weight in the 2 months I've been on it.  I'm quitting today after yet another night of waking up in the middle of the night with pulse of 90 that won't stop.  I was determined to give it the 3 months my doctor said it would take to really see if it would work_ but am increasingly afraid of a heart attack or stroke.  I'm 51 by the way.  When I didn't have any appetite suppresant affects_ I looked it up online and my understanding was that it did not necessarily suppress appetite but it makes you feel full sooner.  I can confirm that I have noticed that_ however I was eating 1200 calories before this and it has not helped me eat less_ so for me it was a big failure.,F,51,57  days,10/12/2008,Meridia
86, 5, weight loss,dry mouth,I started taking Meridia 5 days ago and have already lost 7lbs!! I exercise for about 1 hour everyday and eat healthy small meals. I'm hardly hungry and sometimes have to force myself to eat. Meridia instantly worked to supress my appetite the first day I took it. So far the only side effect I've had was a dry mouth. Hopefully it continues to work like this with no other side effects. I am very pleased with my results so far.,F,,7  days,10/11/2008,Meridia

I have noticed a negative impact on my sexual appetite which is a big bummer :(  Other than that_ the only side effect I have noticed in feeling a little jittery when I haven't eaten in a while.  A small snack takes care of that.  I highly recommend Meridia_ regardless of the large price tag.  It's worth it.  I have another 70 to lose and I'm hoping to do it by this time next year.

90, 4, weight loss,I initially took this last year for a week and it did not supress my appetite so I stopped.  I had very low serotonin levels at the time so perhaps that was the cause of it not working? Anyway_ have gained 20lbs since last year and figured I should try it again. The first day I experienced a little tightness/pain right at my diaphragm_ (perhaps it was gastrointestinal pain) but it was a little painful to breathe deeply.  Today_ my second day_ I am not feeling that pain and I have noticed that I am not constantly hungry or obsessing about food or searching for food when I am bored.,"Have never used any Rx for weight loss except phentermine.

I am eating less that half of what I used to_ not b/c I know I shouldn't eat so much_ but b/c I simply can't eat it.  I have also started karate 2 times a week for 2 hours.  I love the karate and I love the weight loss.  I had been trying for the last 1 1/2 years to lose weight and just couldn't.  I know that my personality requires results_ and after working out and eating right after a month and no results_ I go back to the old ways again.

95, 4, Loose weight,Anxiety_ nervousness_ insomnia_ elevated blood pressure_ dry mouth_ occasional light headaches.,I started taking meridia several months ago_ but wasn't very focused with the dieting part_ and it is important to note that Meridia won't stop you from eating.  However_ I have been diligently taking Meridia while on weight watchers and have noticed a significant difference.  Dry mouth was my first side effect_ which was noticable by the second day_ then it took about a week to realize that I wasn't hungry.  It's important to pay attention to your body and stop eating if you not hungry or don't eat just because it's time to eat.  It still comes down to changing behaviors.  Having been on it for a few weeks the side effects have increased_ to include insomnia_ and anxiety---Not a good thing_ but effective none the less.  I've lost 15 lbs.,F,35,7  weeks,8/28/2008,Meridia

I gained 5lbs. in two days. I've never gained weight that fast before. I'm not sure how long this medication is going to start taking an effect on me. My doctor said that there are excellent results with this medication_ but I have to start off with 10mg first for 4 weeks then increase it to 15mg. I was previously exercising doing Pilates and Taebo along with cutting back with what I eat. I am following my same pattern. I hope this medication starts to take effect soon because it is not cheap. I don't want to feel like I have wasted my $114.00 for 30 pills. I am going to continue with the medicationand hope to see results soon_ if not maybe the 15mg will be better for me.,F,29,7  days,8/28/2008,Meridia

132, 5, to lose 60 pounds,Not too much that I notice so far except I woke up a few times during the night_ but I fell back to sleep right away.,So far so good.  I've only been on Meridia for 2 days and I already notice a dramatic decrease in my appetite.  I no longer have cravings and feel the need to eat because I am bored.  Today I think I'll eat only one meal and a small meal at that.  I am also walking about 2 miles per day to get some exercise.,F,30,2  days,12/31/2007,Meridia

Can have F A T A L effects if you take it with certian anti-depressants or MAOI inhibitors. It's called serotonin syndrome. Anti Depressants work much the same way Meridia does. Guess it's just too much serotonin. I read that on the manufacturer's website.,I lost 60 lbs. in 5 months. This drug works!!! It took about 7 days to see the full effects. Stops ALL cravings in it's tracks. You have to remind yourself to eat. Makes you feel full quickly. The kind of full where you ate waaaaaaaay too much. It does lose it's effectiveness after a few months. Have to go on/off it which was actually good for me so I could learn how to maintain.IT'S WORTH IT!!! Insurance paid 20 % of it. Long time Dr. said it's ok for long term use too. No serious long term effects known now. Getting ready to start up again and lose another 40 to get to goal. Will write again and let you know.,F,50,1  years,12/19/2007,Meridia

I really liked it at first and lost about 30 lbs with it the first 6 months.  However_ I felt the side effects were scary and it lost effectiveness for me after approximately 6 months although I did continue to take it.  I am normally a very calm_ rational person and this drug caused me to get angry really easily.  My patience went to zero.  It totally changed my personality.  I also had difficulty sleeping and remembering things.  After I finally stopped using it_ I gained all the weight back and then some.  I have subsequently lost about 25 lbs. with Weight Watchers and good ol' exercise.,F,42,2  years,10/15/2007,Meridia

Have been taking the medication for 2 months now. I am down 30 pounds at the moment. My food cravings have been greatly reduced... I have even caught myself a few days not eating for more than 12 hours straight while awake. I MUST STRESS that is is important to watch what you eat and exercise a bit too. The pill alone won't likely help you get results... but it certainly will take away your cravings and dull your appetite. I would recommend this to anyone who has serious weight to loss like myself :),M,28,2  months,8/28/2007,Meridia
150, 5, I need to lose 30-40 pounds.,Minor headaches only!,I just gave birth to my first born and had gained 50 lbs during pregnancy.  It's been 4 mths after the birth and I still have the baby fat on. I used this a couple of years ago for 3 mths and had lost 30 lbs with 90 days supply that I had.  After that I stopped and try to exercise and eat well.  Now I'm on it again because of the babyfat.  I have always been very satisfied with this drugs.  I never have major side effects - the only thing I have right now is minor headaches_ but then again it could have been caffeine withdraw_ since it stopped once I drink caffeinated beverages.  I've been on it for 8-9 days now and have lost 8-9 lbs!!!  Amazing!  I think I'm only eating about 500 calories a day now.  Sometimes I get tempted to eat more if I see or smell food that I really like_ but at the same time_ being on meridia_ it's easy to resist that temptation.  Cause you don't feel hungry and if you do_ a little bit of food can satisfy that hunger.  Good luck!,F,33,9  days,8/15/2007,Meridia

I am working on changing my eating habits_ more fruit and veggies_ less fried foods and crap (although I am a sugar-holic!) I used to raid the frige when I got home from work_ but those urges are gone_ so are the cravings.  Before I eat anything_ I check to see if I'm hungry (stomach growling) or just bored. If I'm hungry_ I find a low-fat snack or fruit or something and don't eat until I want to burst anymore.  I don't know if I've lost any weight yet as I don't own a scale.  I see the doctor in 3 weeks and I'll find out then.  It's up to me to change my life_ not the pill.

When i started Meridia I weighed 168 lbs and wore a US size 18 jeans.  I went with my Dr.s recommendation to take Meridia and start a 1200 calorie diet to be eaten in 6 meals per day instead of 3_ and 40% of calories had to be from protien_ 30% carbs_ 30% fats.  Within 6 months_ I was 125lbs and wearing a US size 5 jeans!  I had energy again_ felt young again and was so happy.  Upon taking Meridia_ my social anxeity and depression were also finally under control.  I've taken other SRI drugs for the social anexity and depression but they either didn't work or had side effects that were worse...but with Meridia_ I finally felt like I had my life back.  I felt awake for the first time in years.  I was only allowed to stay on it for 2 years according to my Dr.  So I have been off of it for 4 years now....and I am right back up to 164 lbs and a size 16.

The dry mouth problem disappeared after week 6 so I now have ZERO side effects!  My BMI was 36 when I started and is now at 32.  I am so thrilled!

I've noticed just a slight increase in both_ but they have stayed within normal range.  I am very happy with this drug. I'm almost back to the weight I was before having my three kids.

238, 5, Need to lost about 60 lbs,Very mild dry mouth which seems to have subsided.  Might be good though since drinking more water is always a good thing. :-),I've lost 10 lbs in 1 month.  More exercise will increase that.  I am really satisfied with it.  It has made me recognize that most of my eating is boredom and habit related.

It's hard to describe_ but my eating before was all-consuming and hard to control and now I feel so much more focused.,F,35,1  months,3/10/2006Email,Meridia
