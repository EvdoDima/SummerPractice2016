0, 5, Type 2 Diabetes,Upon starting TRULICITY_  I spent two days with some strange gastric disturbance;  constant flatulence and frequent belching up a nasty sulfuric_ rancid taste in my mouth.  Then it subsided_  and I have had no further undesirable side-effects since.,The BIG thing:   my appetite has been all-but-negated!  As in_ no hunger for anything_  anytime_  24hrs a day.   But I'm thrilled with this!   I am about 50lbs too heavy_  and I need to lose weight. My other meds gave me a ferocious_  truly out-of-control sweet tooth_ and of course my insulin played all kinds of games with my sugars and appetite.  For the first time in 15 years_  I am not overeating.  It's a blessing.   I sincerely hope TRULICITY will allow me to take off my extra pounds.  If a patient on the drug were already very thin_   this loss of appetite might be worrying_   but in my case--  bring it on!,M,53,1  weeks1.5 units 1X W,7/3/2016Email,Trulicity
