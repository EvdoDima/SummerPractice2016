1, 5, asthma,I don't remember any_ but that was years ago.,I had uncontrolled asthma throughout elementary school.  This product became available to me around 1955 and was a godsend for allowing me to go to school regularly with limited sick days.  I carried it with me until albuterol became available and my doctor prescribed it instead.  I was about 15 when I started taking it.,M,66,20  years,4/16/2007,Medihaler-iso
