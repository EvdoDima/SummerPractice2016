The estolate is considered most reliable_ providing the least incidence of relapse.... Ilosone_ the liquid form of erythromycin given to children_ is an estolate. The succinate variety is generally considered least effective."" p. 35    ""...a 14-day course of treatment is considered essential to avoid relapse...."" p. 34    ""The nature of the disease process makes treatment of pertussis difficult. While the bacteria_ Bordetella pertussis_ is actually very responsive to erythromycin_ the bacteria produces an endotoxin that is not responsive. The erythromycin will usually eradicate the bacteria within the first five days of treatment (although a 14-day course of treatment is considere",F,2,14  days,9/15/2005,Ilosone

A diagnosis at this stage is nearly impossible without a culture_ and culturing often appears unnecessary. In addition_ the cultures are difficult to  read and culturing too early can produce false-negative results...."" p. 34 (I believe I have learned somewhere--don't now know where--that culturing after the ""whooping"" stage begins almost frequently results in a false negative culture...I may have found where!...see under ""re testing..."")Regarding testing for pertussis (timing is important_ as noted above and below).

Researchers armed with this special test found that 34 of them had undiagnosed infection with B. pertussis.)
