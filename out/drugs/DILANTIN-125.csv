6, 5, Epilepsy,Son born with methemoglobinemia. He's was fine after a few years.  No side effects until recently so it's difficult to distinguish if it's the Dilantin or menopause.

22, 4, Grand Mal Seizures,This drug has been a life-saver for me.  34 years ago I was in an accident that caused seizures to begin.  The only time I have seizures is if I go off Dilantin.  I take 100 mg in the am and 200 mg in the PM.  Until recently_ I have always been able to maintain strong focus and memory.  I have been noticing some short term memory problems lately-(may be related to perimenopause) and some problems maintaining focus.  Again_ not sure totally of the cause.  I DEFINITELY advise ALL of you to have your Vitamin D levels checked as well as regular Bone Mass Density testing.  Dilantin interferes with Vitamin D absorption and unless you are outside a tremendous amount_ you may need a supplement in addition to your calcium supplements. Please consult your doctor before you start any supplements.   Also_ it is important to NOT take your mineral supplements at the same time you take your dilantin.  Separate them by at least a couple of hours.  My Vitamin D level was 12-- normal is 35-100?  Do some,,F,47,34  years,4/9/2007,Dilantin-125

Didn't know these were possible side-effects of dilantin until I went on site for acne treatment and they mentioned dilantin may cause acne. Started investigating more and asking more questions. No dr. I have had has mentioned these side-effects which is really annoying because I thought I have been losing my mind. I can't remember things quickly. It is like my brain is in slow motion.

36, 3, Epilepsy (from brain tumour),Initially worked well_ no grand-mals but I quickly started tolerating it & focal seizures returned.
