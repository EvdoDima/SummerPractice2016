2, 4, Trigeminal Neuralgia,"Spacey_ ""out of it"" feeling. Losing my train of thought.  Possibly lethargic (or busy life !) Not feeling like myself.",It took a few days to kick in_ and then I was 100 pain-free. For 4 months_ now at 5 months_ has lost its effectiveness. I am having to add a dose on alternating nights. The next day seems better_ less intense pain. But I will be adjusting dose and/or medication soon.,F,37,5  months200 mg 3X D,1/21/2011,Carbatrol
3, 5, Epilepsy,I've taken anti-seizure meds for 25 years_ so I don't remember what I'm like without them. Things that I think are probably side effects: I need at least 8 hours of sleep a night to function_ I think I had mood swings when I first started taking Carbatrol (at age 10)_ and I definitely have a foggy/dazed feeling sometimes. I've also had ongoing balance problems/dizziness/vertigo and trouble remembering words or recalling information.,Despite the side effects_ I love this medication because it has helped me live a normal life. Carbatrol (and before that_ Tegretol) completely controls the seizures--I'm on a relatively low dosage (400 mg/day) but it works well for me. I took Dilantin as a child_ which had much worse side effects and which I later found out isn't recommended for children. Carbatrol is much better.,F,29,19  years,1/9/2010,Carbatrol
4, 4, grand mal seizures,dramatically increased migraine frequency,While the frequent migraines are quite awful_ I had experienced migraines when I was younger_ so I don't fully blame the Carbatrol. On the positive side_ it did stop my once-a-month grand mal seizures cold_ so it's worth it.,M,24,3  years,11/5/2009,Carbatrol
5, 2, Bipolar 2 manic depression suicidal,Fatigue_ balance problems_ dizziness when standing_Extremely tired when I wake up. I take 200mg at bed. My mouth is so dry when I wake that i have toi scoop the caked saliva out of my mouth so I can brush my teeth.,I hate taking all this crap.. just because I am the type of person that will tell you that you are stupid_ if you are doing something stupid. The youth nowadays .. have no respect and I say and do  attempt to straighten there veiws on life.,M,45,5  years,9/7/2009,Carbatrol
6, 3, trigeminal neuralgia,Tired feeling_ Leg Cramps,Relieved pain associated with problem within 48 hours and almost completely eliminated all pain within 7-10 days. Took 200 mg twice a day for approx 4 months before it stopped working almost overnight. Pain returned twice as bad as original within 48 hours of secondary attack. Increased medication to 200mg three times a day along with secondary medication in order to control problem again,M,50,6  months,2/25/2009,Carbatrol
7, 3, nerve pain,spacey_ very out of it feeling. extremely nauseous the first week. after that subsided just tiredness on 400 mg.,have had some pain relief_ but not enough. have also tried neuronton & lyrica but couldn't handle the side effects.,F,33,6  months,1/6/2009,Carbatrol
8, 5, trigeminal neuralgia,I have been taking 300 mg carbatrol slow release since 1999.  Initially_ I would still get breakthrough pain and would increase the carbatrol up to 1200 mg of carbatrol a day.  In the beginning of my regimen I was tired and would come home from work and go to bed.  Never experienced dizziness from carbatrol_ but do feel that it has affected my short term memory.  Eventually my body adjusted.  To this day_ I take 300 mg of carbatrol a day and no longer have any side effects or am so used to them_ they do not bother me.  I have been pain free since 2003.,,F,65,9  days,7/3/2008,Carbatrol
9, 4, Complex Partial Seizures,Fatigue_ balance problems_ dizziness when standing_ slight weight gain_ acne,Carbatrol works. I haven't had a seizure since I started taking it_ so I can't really complain. Side effects aren't great_ but I've gotten used to them (they persist). I need 8 hours of sleep or else I'm non-functional. I feel faint a lot_ so that's a pain.,F,22,1.5  years,1/11/2008,Carbatrol
10, 4, Trigeminal Neuralgia,The first two weeks of taking Carbatrol I was so incredibly nauseous and thought it would never go away.  Despite that_ Carbatrol has been the only thing that has made my pain subside.,Seldomly I have breakthrough pain that is treated with Vicodin.  I've had to stop taking Carbatrol cold turkey because I found out that I'm pregnant.  This has caused withdrawls_ similar to how sick I was when I first started taking it.  I've lost the weight I gained in 4 days since stopping (only 6 pounds).  Despite how nauseous I've been Carbatrol has controlled my pain in a way that Neurontin couldn't.,F,30,2.5  months,5/26/2004,Carbatrol
