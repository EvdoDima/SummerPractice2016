0, 4, adult ADD,dry mouth_ trouble sleeping_ headaches - that went away,I think that some people's extremely bad reactions to this drug are largely from taking far too high of a dose. There is no one size fits all - start at the absolute lowest possible dose and you an always go up. Don't let a dr tell you low doses do not work - no dr. will know which dose is best for you_ and the lowest amount of medication is always the safest_ and has the fewest side fx.,F,51,6  months5 mg 1X D,7/9/2016,Dexedrine

All I want to do is get warm and go to sleep. I have no drive at all. My fingers sometimes hurt too. This is not making me worse not better.

3, 1, ADHD,This drug steals your soul. It makes you an efficient yet emotionless drone. Love ceases to matter. You become arrogant. You become increasingly suspicious and aggressive. It has been repeatedly proven that dexedrine (speed) destroys your dopamine neurons.Once you stop taking it_ you become withdrawn_ depressed and apathetic. This doesnt go away for many people and they are left with varying degrees of neurotoxicity (brain damage) for life. For any user of this poison_ I urge you to stop taking the drug for two weeks so you can really see what this drug has done to your brain.,The sad thing is that most users will not consider that the amphetamine has change their personality or is negatively effecting them in any way even though family members and friends notice the personality change,M,20,2  months30mg 1X D,12/28/2015,Dexedrine
4, 1, Adult ADHD,I was taking dexedrine spans u Les 15mg twice a day (30 a day total) and even when I just took it once a day it was awful. Insomnia_ didn't sleep for days_ irritability_ extreme mood swings_ anger outbursts and sudden crying_ uncontrollable rage_ apathy_ desire to hurt others and myself_ paranoia_ thought my bosses wanted to try to come up with reasons to fire me_ irrational thinking_ anhedonia. Symptoms sneak up on you too. I didn't have the weird anxiety that I had with adderall ir but I was basically in a bipolar meltdown and I didn't even realize how bad it was until my boss and friends kept telling me something was wrong. When I went off of it I could tell that my behavior the past couple months was bizarre and irrational. I would never take medication again before I take this garbage.,,F,26,2  months30 mg,10/9/2015Email,Dexedrine

I can lay in bed and produce website content_ research or read but I am useless once I put my feet on the ground. It feels like I have sensory overload. Too loud_ too bright_ too hot or cold. I feel weird around people like this. Side effects this severe should have worn off by now. Too bad though because I can focus on producing material a lot better. Tinnitus gets very distracting at times though. The problem with my eyes is a complete deal breaker. It's nasty.

9, 2, ADHD,Palpitations,Compared to when I was taking adderall for two years_dexedrine does not do a damn thing for my ADHD and the palpitations are real bad. Especially hours after dose wore off.

Dry mouth is gross_ weird fixation with teeth...my teeth sometimes felt like they wanted to pop out of my mouth snd my tongue would constantly be massaging them sometimes. I took as break on weekends to decrease tolerance and only took 10mg (IR) as needed. Increased heart rate if drinking caffeine wasnt fun and sweating and heat intolerance sometimes sucked. Overall I prefer this to Modafinil because although Modafinil helped with concentration and increasing my analytical skills it also decreased my ""awake time"" and Modafinil also decreased my productivity due to my increased hyper-analyzing and obsessing over things I wouldn't normally obsess over. I guess if my goal was to stay home and paint or be a recluse in office and analyze data all day Modafinil would be okay...but I prefer to interact with business clients & professionals in business & social settings and my career goals require a more extroverted lifestyle.",,F,39,2  years15mg ER,5/28/2014Email,Dexedrine

13, 3, ADD,Loss of appetite. Weight loss.,"I found that dexedrine helped me to stay on task more. Down side that I found was that if I were to have caffeine during my day (equivalent to a coffee or more) I would often not sleep that night for anymore than an hour (if that).Worst side effect that came along with dexedrine: When I started taking dexedrine I weighed in at 170lbs (I'm 6""1'). I found that within the first week of using dexedrine_ my appetite declined dramatically. I began to skip breakfast and lunch daily. I would usually only eat dinner and when I did eat dinner I didn't eat very much even if it was one of my favorite meals. Food just lost its attraction for me. When I finished my second month of dexedrine and had to go back to the doctor for another prescription_ my doctor was worried about my weight and weighed me in at 127lbs. and took me off of dexedrine immediately. I haven't used meds for my so called ""ADD"" since and had trouble gaining weight again after (approx. a year after ending I weighed in at 150lbs.) and now 3 years later I weigh in at 210lbs (still 6""1')",M,17,2  months30MG 1X D,12/17/2013Email,Dexedrine

15, 5, inattentive ADHD,overlapping dosages increases heart rate to an uncomfortable state_ so it is very important to follow dosage directions closely. If you take a full prescription half way through the day you will not sleep_ so only take half a dosage if you find yourself in that predicament. this medication was the first one I was completely satisfied with_ no side effects mentally_ just hard on body physically.

I most likely will get the new Wilshire soon... there are differences but they are great meds... I grew up on this and when I had it how it worked the best... 20 mg TID... I did great.  I could eat when I had breaks and vitamins B_ magnesium_ chlorella and spirulina_ coq10... i hated it in school... I was in ap classes but I finished really early and would leave or drive the class nuts... i had to fail everything to get the tabs again even after years... but she agreed_ called me in the old dose and I could keep a train of thought and i like having times when it wore off and I could eat (a little)... because the breaks change priorities and I dont overdo it.,,M,31,10  years60 mg,5/3/2013Email,Dexedrine
17, 4, ADHD/Idiopathic Hypersomnia/SleepAp,Inability to fall asleep (until 12 hrs after last dose)_ clenching of the jaw_ and lack of appetite (until medication wears off).,However_ although I have some improved focus_ I have not experienced the improvement in short-term working memory that I experienced when I was briefly on a higher dose of Ritalin (90mg).  At that point I could hold on to my thoughts longs enough to let someone else talk_ and not panic that I was going to forget what I was thinking.  I could also think a couple steps ahead in chess without losing my place.  This medicine_ however_ appears to be a middle-of-the-road for me (between Ritalin and Adderall).  After two months on this medicine_ I still lack both the short-term memory benefits of a higher Ritalin dosage_ as well as a sizable improvement in energy_ as experienced on Adderall.  Im still hoping for some sizable improvements in these areas_ but as of yet_ they havent come in any markable quantities.Originally_ the side-effects were the following: Inability to fall asleep (until 12 hrs after last dose)_ clenching of the jaw_ and lack of appetite (until medication wears off).  Two months on the medication and the inability to sleep has dropped to around 7-8 hrs_ I don't clench my jaw as much_ and my appetite is returning.  Originally_ the benefits included the following:  Dramatic reduction in mental fatigue_ I quit (mostly) interrupting others_ increased ability to tune out other stimuli when performing an activity_ and a noticeable improvement of will power (when it came to sugary foods).

18, 4, (See my comments below.),"Because my condition is very unique and fairly complicated_ it would be inaccurate for me to characterize anything I have experienced as a side effect.  However_ I will say this.  For the better part of the last 18 years I've taken either  ""mixed salt"" amphetamine tablets (Adderall: dextro & levo) or  ""dextro only"" amphetamine tablets (Dexedrine tablets: dextro only).   For the last 9 years I've only taken Dexedrine (Generic Brand: Dextrostat).  I will always be indebted to the person who posted a ""Addreall vs Dexedrine"" type of comment on one of the many sites I was using to try and identify individuals with a similar experience to my own.  This one comment would have a significant impact on my life in the years that followed.  This was the gist of the posted comment I read.  ...Most of the negative side effects experienced by people taking Addreall are believed to come from the ""levo"" side of the mixture (the left-handed amphetamine molecul","So here is my suggestion for anyone out there who has been taking Adderall for any length of time; and maybe you feel like you couldn't function without Adderall now_ because it absolutely enables you to ""do"" what you couldn't ""do"" without it.  If you feel like there is a lot of other ""crap"" (for lack of a better word) you've had to manage_ or tolerate_ because you have just accepted that to get the good effects you have to put up with the bad effects_ if this rings true for you_ then I would encourage you to try just the dextro-amphetamine and see if you can't do even better than you're doing now.  (If you've ever heard of someone doing better on Focalin than they did on Ritalin_ what I've written about here is exactly the same thing.  One notable difference is the fact that Dexedrine came out 40 years BEFORE Adderall_ whereas Focalin was introduced roughly 40 years AFTER Ritalin.)  Now my last word_ will be to say that I found I needed the same amount of Dexedrine as I did of Adderall.  This is contrary to what the chemists/mathematicians believe.  They say that 20mg of dextroamphetamine sulfate is more active than 20mg of dextro- and levo-amphetamine. (Think of the Adderall as being a little diluted.)  But according to MY BODY_ ""less"" was not ""more""_ ""less"" was just ""less"".

36, 4, ADD,Generic Barr Dexedrine feels very weak. If you take a lot of it_ it feels stronger (duh lol)_ reason I mention it is because Adderall will cause more side effects_ this will cause less of them. It is better in higher dosages_ at least for me since I take the XR version. Taking L-Tyrosine as well for the comedowns. It is a very smooth feeling_ so its almost unnoticeable. Side effects are minimal_ but the effects are also not very strong. Great for mood lift_ motivation goes away quickly for me_ does not motivate anymore.,Adderall XR is better for me. Write a list of things to do for the day_ it will drastically improve your life more than this drug will_ but this drug can help that list! This is a very weak medication_ it is like Eastern Medicine_ except the side effects are more severe since you take them daily. What side effects? Insomnia can be one_ but it isn't paradoxically low doses cause me to fall asleep. Appetite loss_ but that goes away after a while_ I don't lose my appetite anymore. OCD as well_ but I am too lazy for that to be a problem. Procrastination occurs for me_ I am supposed to be doing something else_ but here I am_ but that is a habit_ not the drug's fault. Do something else besides take the drug_ its like giving yourself a black box with no instructions_ and the black box controls (overstatement_ it modifies) your every thought and action. Everyday use will disable you when you stop_ you will be tired_ unmotivated and very depressed. Namenda/Memantine will help you if you grow too tolerant_ as well DXM_ the cough syrup.

I am sleepy all the time. I pretty much stopped living my life because of it. I couldn't go to the theater for a movie after 8PM. Stopped hanging out at friends because I would fall asleep on the couch. Stayed away from lazy boys and comfy couches and sat on bar stools. Sex? I would fall asleep_ wake up in the middle of the night for sex and fall right to sleep afterwards. Once the sun goes down_ so do I. Driving was more of an autopilot response. Sometimes I'd get to my destination without really realizing it or I would miss my exit for work. BAD! So_ after my MSLT revealed a sleep latency of 3 minutes after almost perfect sleep_ stimulants were added to my regime. I take 5mg in the morning and another 5mg as needed. I only take the 2nd dose if I actually have plans. If not_ what's the point of being awake?! :). 5mg is low_ but it works MOST of the time (which is why i rated a 4). If I wake up excessively excessively tired_ I'll take 10mg. But 10mg means a harder crash and a feeling of hopelessness which is why I don't want to increase my dosage (but I've been thinking about adding a 3 pill a day to help the crash). 5mg opens my eyes.

40, 2, ADHD,Common Side-Effects: Diminished appetite_ minor  insomnia_ chronic fatigue_ minor OCD-like compulsions_ withdrawal fatigue & irritability_ increased anxiety_ completely lethargic & useless without it.Serious effect_ but rare: Severe Depression_ hopelessness_ feeling out of body_ feelings that I do not know when I last truely lived in the moment_ feeling like like a ghost_ Suicidal ideation (this issue lasted for about two month_ but I have been good for 2 years)_ lethargy_ Complete loss of appetite when resuming dosage_ increased sexual drive_ sexual compulsion and short lived but severe addiction. ,I have been prescribed Dexedrine for nine years. Prior to that I was on Ritalin but I was taken off after experiencing auditory hallucinations_ anxiety & paranoia. Late high school I became extremely addicted_ the less sleep I got the more I took and the more I took... vicious cycle. By the end of grade 11 I was only sleeping 45 minutes to 3 hours a night_ I would usually need to take a double or triple dose to remain functional. At the worst when I was sleep on an hour or two a night I would dose before sleeping so I would wake up when I needed to.  After High-school and university (did not complete)_ I attempted to get off it_ I was off for two years but then I started working in an office environment where I realized I could not function. I resumed my prescription. I have been much more responsible for my dosing_ this resulted in less severe side effects. Since I have resumed though temporary OCD like compulsion occasionally develop and I have overcome most of the social life I lost after resuming I have noticed that I am getting less and less of an effect from it though_ but I do not with to increase my dose although my professional and home life is suffering. I would like to say that while I would like nothing more than to get off this drug. For all the things I hate about it_ without it I could not function. I would jump at the opportunity to try a drug-free alternative. But I do not know where to start.I feel like a zombie_ but I feel like I trapped.,M,25,9  years30 mg 1X D,8/28/2010Email,Dexedrine

Effects are increased depending on how much food I've had_ and there's a strange combination with caffeine which makes me sleepy.,For me_ this was basically a miracle cure.  I went through much of my life without an ability to concentrate_ but I also mostly didn't need to concentrate either.  I don't get hyper_ so I picked jobs which didn't require much out of me.  I was uncomfortable and bored most of the time but didn't know what to do.  I then started university and found I actually had to be able to concentrate_ and after 4 years of unsuccessfully trying to write a thesis I decided to seek help.  I was initially prescribed Ritalin but its effects were not controlled (some days I got anxiety_ other days I felt like I had no effect) so I switched to Dexedrine. After doing so_ I wrote a 120 page thesis in 3 weeks_ and have since achieved so many goals_ and have really succeeded in my life and career.

Prefer name brand but without insurance now can only afford generic. I did notice a drop off in efficacy. Found medication to be MORE than a night and day difference.

46, 5, Adult ADD,Before starting Dexedrine_ I would fall asleep in movies_ operas_ driving!_ while walking. Dexedrine keeps me alert. I put this as a side effect because it was prescribed for A ADD. I still have no trouble falling asleep_ but I can stay awake even during boring meetings. For the last 3 years I've been waking up several times a night_ but that is getting better now. I lost some weight when I started_ but I was still enjoying food. No other side effects. I'm not hyper or agitated_ I just feel normal. No withdrawal when I stop taking it either. The lack of withdrawal is actually a problem when I forget my dosage. I'll discover that I've accomplished absolutely nothing at the end of the day.,Dex_ along with Welbutrin_ some coaching I had_ and a much better understanding of ADD and coping methods_ have made a huge difference since my diagnosis 7 years ago.I still procrastinate somewhat_ so occasionally I abuse Dex by continuing to take 15mg/4 hours to allow me to stay up all night and meet a deadline. I can only do that very infrequently without getting messed up.I know this drug isn't for all ADD sufferers_ but it's great for me and my daughter too. I found that Ritalin had no effect on me.

I forgot to take my afternoon meds and had a complete meltdown over a hard drive quiting mid movie.  It took my fiance 30 minutes to talk me down.   Later I gave some clear instructions to a friend regarding a task i needed him to do for me...he could not complete it_ so i sent a super nasty text message.

Aside from that no problems at all.,I was first on Adderall_ then Adderall XR (60 mg/day)_ both helped but Dexedrine has been better with fewer side effects.

49, 4, Adult ADHD,Insomnia which sometimes can be helpful_ slight hallucinations (minor twitches in peripheral vision_ etc) but I had that with adderall too_ it is rare I guess. The side effects are much more mild than those of adderall even when you convert the doses. Best part is that I didn't lose my appetite_ since I'm trying to gain weight.,I guess I have ADHD pretty badly_ I somehow got by in school without medication. In my experience dexedrine keeps me mentally awake but still doesn't help my ability to focus after taking even 45mg a day. It hasn't helped my reading rate as much as I had hoped_ I still average 5-10 pages in a textbook an hour which sucks because I'm in good shape to get accepted to medical school where there will be a lot more reading. A friend of mine ran out of her adderall during Midterms week so I let her borrow some of my dexedrine_ she had 20mg of Adderall XR which is about 30mg of dexedrine. After taking two of my dexedrine she had said that she felt it was too powerful so my dose just may not be high enough.,M,20,4  months,11/17/2009,Dexedrine

53, 5, ADD,Loss of appetite_ allergic reaction_ minor problems sleeping_ slight headache,I was on this medication for about a week.  I had switched over from Concerta_ because the price was way less_ and seeing as I don't have real insurance_ it was a life saver.  The first time I took it_ I became very talkative_ but after that first day the side effects mostly wore off (except for the suppressed appetite_ which was a bit hard to fight against).  What it did for my concentration and attitude was AMAZING.  I felt wonderful_ was able to focus on my school work_ able to get things done_ and all the associated symptoms of ADD that are so hard to control for me (such as impulse control) were just...fixed.  But after a few days_ I wound up getting a fever_ rash_ and wheezing_ and it turned out that I was allergic to it.  They use a certain dye in the making of it that I have a bad reaction to_ and I wish I could find this medication without that dye.  This worked a million times better than Concerta_ was super inexpensive_ and I wish that I could have continued to take it!  It improved my mood_ my behavior_ my concentration - just all around_ it was great.  Maybe the effects wouldn't have been as nice had I been on it longer_ but this is definitely something I wish I could have stuck with.,F,22,1  weeks,10/4/2009,Dexedrine

I tried 30mg today and seems to be a good dose. Will see what happens when I don't take it tomorrow. Hope I don't have to go higher.

Began taking this medicaton in 2002_ was grateful because other medications had not worked for me. Increased my alertness & energy levels & I was able to maintain my focus and attention. I was on 60 mg of dexedrine a day_ slow release. The benefits far out weighed the side affects until 2007 when the side affects became too difficult to manage. I was weened off the medication for a few months but my fatique without the medication was debilitating so I went back on 15 mg a day. I have been able to function at this dosage for almost 2 years but am now stuggling with severe fatigue even on the medication.  I want to increase my dosage to address the fatigue but the side affects are no longer managable even at 15 mg especially with this recent development with my teeth. I developed additional health issues as well. It appears that although I strictly adhere to my dosage_ this medication still has an addictive affect on my body and is causng some additional health issues.,F,42,7  years,5/26/2009,Dexedrine

I finished college and began a career with the help of this medication. Recently_ with a new Dr. I was switched to Vyvanse. He said it was smoother when taking effect and wearing off. Honestly_ I am sure that it helped for the past 7 months that I took it_ but it is SOOOO expensive and I feel that I did better on dexedrine.

Dexedrine has been much better to me. The effects are much more level and sustained than Ritalin. Only have to take one spansule a day. Never have experienced withdrawal when I've missed doses. I am able to express myself appropriately and control my impulses. Without it I am scattered and frustrated person as ADD makes it hard focus your attention and organize thoughts.

I think my sense of humor suffers a bit also.-Thankfully I have NOT suffered any sexual side effects. Being young and newly married_ I was quite apprehensive about this!,"Overall I'm pleased with the results. Getting some sort of prescription was a must for me_ as I literally had a 15 minute attention span. In a lecture_ for example_ I was physically unable to take reliable notes beyond about 20 minutes in. Dexedrine allows me to focus for as long as I need to.If you actually have ADD (and I do)_ forget about using this drug as a stimulant. It doesn't seem to have that effect on me_ or others I know who are taking it. I can take two and go to sleep if the mood strikes me.I don't take Dexedrine on the the weekends_ as I have no need for the extra focussing power then_ and I don't get bad withdrawl symptoms.If you have Tourette's-like tics_ Dexedrine will make them worse and you will be unhappy.

When medication is stopped I become ravenously hungry_ lethargic to the point of being unable to move_ and sleep all day.,This drug is a double edged sword.  I think it just comes down to one question_ is it worth it?  The side effects can be managed although I find the only way I am able to fall asleep (and wake up in the morning)is by smoking small amounts of marijuana before bed.  I also resort to marijuana when I get intense hunger pains yet am unable to eat.  Dexedrine affects my appetite by making all food unappealing to me_ I find myself trying to eat but just holding food in my mouth_ never able to actually swallow it.  On the plus side_ because of Dexedrine I completed a University degree_ got an amazing job_ and am a far better mother than I was when I was not on it.  I'm sure that my life would fall apart without it...so I cope with the side effects.

I have gone all the way up to 60mg twice a day(4hour pills) with no motivation still.

77, 4, fibromyalgia fatigue,The first few months were marked by the need to gradually increase the dose from 5 mg to 30 mg/day. Over the last 5 years_ the 30 mg has been good most days_ BUT the last 4 months I've been terribly tired. (I ALSO QUIT SMOKING THEN. CONNECTION???),Please contact me if you have any suggestions about doseage changes_ changing from one day to the next according to daily needs_ ANY RELATIONSHIP TO SMOKING_ or any other helpful comments. Thank you kindly in advance.,M,51,5  years,8/22/2007Email,Dexedrine
78, 5, ADD,dissorted thinkingdepression and drowsiness when not taking itbeing too excited over little things,helps me focus but makes me feel very sad an anti-social when i dont take it. i like the apitite supressent but days i dont take it i binge eat. i didnt take it today and thats why i didnt want to hang out with my friends and am sad and feel like the world hates me. but its great and i get everything done and can keep a job while on it. ive been on them since 4rth or 5th grade,F,17,10  years,8/7/2007,Dexedrine
79, 4, ADD,Extreme anxiety_ sleep loss_ initially had extreme loss of appetite (weight loss can seem good at first_ but trust me- make yourself eat or you'll get sick)_ skin seems to turn purple occassionally (with lack of sleep)_ cotton mouth_ nicotine cravings_ EXTREME WITHDRAWAL (VERY IRRITABLE_ DEPRESSED when not on it),While this drug has changed my life for the better_ it definitely is something i now cannot imagine not taking... when i'm not taking it i feel helpless and extremely irritable.  the worst side effect may be my craving of cigarettes_ i smoke about 10 cigs a day and can only smoke when i am on my medication (no desire when i'm not on it).  so if you are on the medication_ DO NOT START SMOKING_ YOU'LL NEVER STOP.  it does cut back on my creativeness and i am not as outgoing- the drug definitely makes me anxious when i'm on it. but again_ for school work or a job_ i would highly recommend (just be ready for the dependency). p.s. i take 30 mg long-term capsules each morning_ supplemented with 10 mg tablets only as needed,M,24,8  years,8/1/2007,Dexedrine

BUT I find the shortness of breath and detached_ disconnected feeling very scary and I can't handle the recommended dose (10mg x 3 every day). Instead I take 2.5 mg twice a day and take breaks on weekends. Dex can really make a difference but it's worth being careful with dosage.,F,38,3  weeks,7/19/2007Email,Dexedrine

I say bipolar because it only happened as the drug was wearing off.  I would be just fine all day but as it wore off I found myself sinking into a deep_ hopeless depression.

99, 4, long term amphetamine abuse,dry mouth_ dark orange urine_ temporary migraine type blind spots_ shrunken penis (honestly it does),been prescribed dexedrine for 14 years_ my gp forgot about me and kept on writing the prescriptions_ i often take whole months supply now in 1 week and this_ although it's a nice buzz_ makes you feel shitty for another week. I find they are a great motivator and the lack of sleep helps to get things done. brilliant for concentration and focusing on particular tasks / jobs. It really is important to back up the lack of sleeptime with food as the energy required to keep up with the effects of this drug is substantial. I'm 38 now and after a lifetime of amphetamine usage (started at age 14) I can't see a future without dexedrine. Although I abuse mine I would strongly recommend that people dont go down the same road as i have_ and use them as prescribed. The up and down effects take a lifetime to get used to. They taste awful if chewed and clammy sweaty skin is almost as awful to deal with as that taste. I just hope I havent knocked too many years off my life by taking them.,M,38,14  years,4/7/2005Email,Dexedrine
