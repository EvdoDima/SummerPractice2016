0, 2, Heart palpitations and hbp,Horrible medication_ am now getting off it_ I hope the damage is not irreversible. Am on 4 medications for sudden onset labile high blood pressure_ tribezor and aldactone_ last 4 years. Developed heart palpitations after the death of my mother in May_ with adrenaline rushes and bp of 220/105. Doctor said I was going to have a stroke. Wanted to put me on Coreg but had tried that 2 years ago and had horrible side effects_ pounding heart_ shaking and tinnitus. Doctor insisted I needed to go on Bystolic_ initially resisted but gave in after two weeks. I shouldn't have! After about 3 days_ developed numbness in hand_ muscle pain in arm_ (feels sore like I had a flu shot)_ such severe pain in leg and hip I have a hard time getting up in the morning. After 1 week_ called PA and she cut in half to 5 mg. pain didn't go away_ couldn't get heart rate up during exercise. After another 2 weeks_ I cut it in half again_ but symptoms didn't go away. Hand numb all the time_ arm and leg ache_ having cramps in calves_ and 2 nights ago_ developed very severe itching and broke out in hives! Called PA today_ she wanted to switch me to Toprel_ (I had bad tinnitus with that one 4 years ago)_ I said NO. Beta blockers are the drugs from hell. She's doing blood work_ but told me to take 2.5 mg every other day for a week - but yo expect rebound HBp and more heart palpitations!! My cardio is going to yell at me when I see him next month - but I'll yell back. And NO more beta blockers!,,F,64,1  days10,8/12/2016,Bystolic
1, 3, High blood pressure_ arrhythmia,Panic attacks_ anxiety_ bursts of adrenaline feelings_ weakness_ headache_ visual disturbances,I was on 5mg of bystolic up until about 2 weeks ago. This was a switch from atenolol. This drug does a much better job with blood pressure but the 5mg made bp and heart rate very low. Started with unexplained panic attacks and a visual disturbance that sent me to the ER. Cut dosage in half. Feeling better than I did on the 5 mg but my doctor did not feel it was the medication. I disagree. Never had problems with sudden panic and anxiety. Time for a new doctor. Listen to your own body. You know it better than anyone.,F,45,3  months2.5 mg,7/23/2016,Bystolic
2, 3, Blood pressure and arrhythmia,Seems to increase episodes of arrhythmia.,My top number concerning my blood pressure was still too high. I went from a resting heart rate of over 100 to around 76 and up to 83. Doctor reassured me that it should not increase my arrhythmia problems if I increased dosage to 20MG but it seems its only slowing my heart significantly and not resolving and other issues.,F,37,3  days20MG,7/13/2016Email,Bystolic
3, 3, Blood Pressure,Powerful medication! On 5mg many side effects...fatigue.....weakness.......depression....But blood pressure way down 117/69.

4, 4, Heartbeat high,Very tired. Numbness in my arms and shoulders_ joint pain_ especially in hands and knees.  Mild dizziness_ vision seems worse.  Mild nausea.  Not sure if any of it is related to Bystolic_ but I don't take any other medications or supplements or vitamins.  The comments here have made me a bit nervous.  I don't want to have a stroke_ but I'm not completely comfortable with taking this med.,,F,49,6  months5mg 1X D,6/27/2016,Bystolic
5, 1, Pre-hypertension 135/90,Shoulder pains_ extreme tiredness_ abdominal pains close to ribs on right and left_ chest pains_ hard to breathe_ wrist pains_ anxiety_ weight gain.,My blood pressure always ran slightly high and I certainly have white-coat syndrome. I was prescribed Bystolic 5mg which did not affect my BP_ so was increased to 10mg where I remained for nearly a year. I felt detached from reality and walked around in a constant daze even though taking my dosage at night. Only a hour after being awake_ I would fight to keep my eyes open. My sleep was not affected by this drug. My blood pressure pleased the doc_ but the side effects where too much to handle. I told my doc I was weaning off_ so he gave me a week's supply of 5mg samples and told me to monitor my BP. After the week of 5mg_ I would be off the drug. That was 8 days ago and I have started feeling a bit like my old self again. I still have periods of anxiety_ but not constant like when taking the meds. Looking forward to the rest of the symptoms to go away completely as it seems they tend to come on for a short period and then go away. No longer feeling like a zombie or a prisoner to this drug. For the past eight days of being off this medication_ my BP has consistently averaged 123/78 with HR 72. I am starting on an exercise regimen since I no longer feel like I am fighting to breathe. While on Bystolic my weight shot up from 195 to 235. This med was not for me and I urge you to have a lengthy conversation with your medical care professional before starting down the Bystolic road...it was a long road for me.,M,46,1  years10mg 1X D,5/31/2016Email,Bystolic
6, 1, HTN_ a-fib,apathy_ decreased kidney function_ leg edema_ insomnia_ weight gain_ cold feet and legs and hands_ inability to function at ANYTHING memory problems,Bystolic not only decreases the ability of my heart to function_ it also decreases blood circulation to my kidneys AND brain.  Until this beast entered into my life_ I rode my horse_ did my own home remodeling and basically enjoyed living.  I was amazingly stupid to allow this poison into my body.  This is not living_ this is sitting in a chair waiting to die.,F,66,13  months5 1X D,5/2/2016,Bystolic
7, 2, High blood pressure,I've been on bystolic 10 mg in the evening with another drug in the morning with a water pill every other day.  Dr switched me to 10 mg of bystolic in the morning and 10 in the evening with a water pill. I am feeling weak  legs are weak insomnia and shortness of breath.  I never had any of this when I wasn't taking meds. I know I need to because of my bp but I don't know how much more I could take. Feeling like an invalid spend most of my days sitting around. Never had this before! Seeing md Friday which I know already he will tell me I'm crazy. I never had any of these symptoms before meds. Please help!!,,F,63,3  months20mg,4/26/2016Email,Bystolic
8, 1, High Blood Pressure,Heavy depression and extreme anxiety.,I just wanted to update my rating from October of last year.  I was on Benicar and had anxiety and depression.  The doctor put me on Bystolic.  In October_ everything was great and I rated it a 5.  Another month went by and I started having the same symptoms as I did on Benicar; extreme anxiety and heavy depression.  In December_ I insisted the doctor put me back on Lisinopril and my symptoms have disappeared.  My BP is right on track and I have not been depressed or had one bout of anxiety since then.,M,47,4  months10 MG 1X D,4/21/2016Email,Bystolic

12, 5, Hypertension_ palpitations_ anxiety,The first month I noticed some hair loss and itchy skin but they both went away.,I tried Metoprolol and Bisoprolol but I could hardly function on them. I take Bystolic at bedtime and get a good night's sleep but it does not make me drowsy if I donÂ’t go to bed right away. It did at first but this changed after a few weeks. As well_ it has helped my anxiety tremendously. Although I still get some palpitations_ they are hardly noticeable. I used to sometimes get tachycardia at night which was horrible and the Bystolic has ended that experience. I absolutely love it!,F,61,4  months2.5,3/25/2016Email,Bystolic

15, 2, Tachycardia_ high BP,Terrible diarrhea_ bad nausea. But the worst thing was what it did to me mentally. Heavy depression_ broke down sobbing_ for no reason I could think of_ every time I was alone. Depressed and had suicidal thoughts (uncharacteristic for me) and very irritable. Very tired in a depressed sort of way. I felt like aliens were controlling my mind.,The only reason I gave it a 2 is because it did lower my BP_ but too much. Now I am off the med and feel normal again. The cause of the BP turned out to be chronic pain_ which has resolved now_ so I don't need a beta-blocker anymore.,F,46,5  days5 mg,2/26/2016,Bystolic
16, 5, Hypertension,Fatigue_ cold sensitivity_ cold hands and feet_ mild lightheadedness on occasion.,My MD and I are satisfied with how Bystolic is working for me.  My BP now ranges in the 110s/70s from 150s and 160s/90s.  Because of the fatigue_ I take my dose in the evening.  If I'm pretty active after my dose_ the fatigue doesn't set in_ but definitely does once my activity level drops.  Not having any insomnia.  We will keep evaluating_ but it's working wonderfully for me right now.  No_ I'm not a paid spokesperson - it really is working well for me.,F,53,1  years5MG 1X D,2/25/2016,Bystolic

I drink a lot of water anyway_ but I was to ""push the fluids"" along with the magnesium. I feel centered and calm--no rushing in my ears or inability to find the right words. I feel very good.

After having chronic insomnia for multiple years_ I'm finally getting decent sleep. I feel that Bystolic has positive effects on my cognition_ mood and attention as well_ probably due to it's positive effects on nitric oxide_ which is very much involved in neurotransmitter function.

Then I got into running marathons_ lost weight and improved my cardiovascular health. Last time I went to the doc. He said that my BP was a little too low  102/58. He mentioned that it may be time to get off Bystolic. I reluctantly said that I'd think about it. I was in the best shape of my life and I really didn't see a reason to change.

123, 1, High blood pressure,It lowered the BP! I am allergic to ALL other beta blockers_ as well as many other drugs. I am a RENAL FAILURE patient_ stage 4_ prepping for dialysis soon. This drug should NOT have been given to me_ it caused a decline almost immediate in my renal function. I also have CHF_ diabetic on insulin_ asthma_ Edema and have had anaphylaxis in hosp from meds. Also have the ringing in ears_ swollen throat. Everything i read_ says i should NOT have been given this. Yet the cardiologist gave to me_ says take more asthma inhaler. ! i had a major attack this morning_ my peak flow meter for asthma was at 125 breathing. i should be at 350. ! I began the taper this morning to 5mg_ perhaps the asthma attack from this. i also am very shaky. Blood sugars are whacky and showing low then i eat and the insulin doesnt work and i shoot up too high. Now i have a bad headache_ cant drive out becuz too shaky and the asthma is bad. Ive had to be hospitalized for asthma issues in the past_ this is as bad as one,I have written to many diff places regarding this drug as i intend to continue to do so. I feel the dr s who prescribe this drug should have his license removed ! without checking renal function in a kidney patient_ prescribes med that will LOWER function. This dr was not a good dr!

125, 1, Hypertension,difficulty breathing,I tried this drug once before about a year ago and apparantly forgot why I stopped taking it - for certain_ it is causing the symptoms I am experiencing after being back on it for just two days_ as they are exactly the same as before_ only worse.  I have episodes of difficulty breathing - not lung difficulty - but the feeling that something is actually squeezing my heart_ preventing me to breath. I do the treadmill elevated for an hour a day_ do hand weights_ swim_ and am active in other sports_ so when I get short of breath climbing one flight of stairs_ it is the medicine - just last week I went up three flights at the mall to the amazement of my friend who is younger than me. I have constant thirst_ ringing in my ears_ and upon waking up_ was very dizzy for the first 2 hours of the day.  Bystolic did lower my bp_ and I could put up with all but the actual feeling of not being able to breath - I truly feel like my heart is in a vise at times.  Definitely not worth it - I hate this drug and will lose weight and go back on my weight watchers diet rather than struggle for breath.  I can't believe I tried it twice - what's the saying fool me once shame on you_ fool me twice shame on me.  I am disposing of it today and stopping it abruptly even though it says otherwise_ my primary care doc said it would be ok to do so.,F,59,2  days5 MG 1X D,1/25/2013Email,Bystolic
126, 1, High Blood Pressure,Severe migraine behind my eyes and achy sore body & severe back pain.,I took this pill for the first time to help my BP of 140/100.  I took it at night so I wouldn't feel or notice any side effects.  I woke up up with a migraine (feels like I got hit with a bat on the back of my neck) at 5am and 12 hours later_ my head and body are sore and I'm only able to move like a 90 year old (but I'm still young). I never get headaches_ my eyes never hurt like this and this is the 4th prescription I try.  Keep in mind I normally feel great and sleep fine. I exercise & eat right but high BP runs in the genes. There is no way_ no how I would take this again just to feel like crap.  Pharmaceutical companies are just putting out junk.

128, 1, hypertension,severe double vision  (binocular diplopia); mild pressure headache;,On day 25 of taking Bystolic 10 MG_ I experienced a terrifying onset of double vision_ also known as binocular diplopia_ that lasted 20-30 minutes after which time it slowly disappeared yet forced me to go the ER. Blood tests_ a CT scan and Xray did not show any physical causes. Until that time the only side effect was a mild pressure headache above the eyes. I've discontinued the medication and am consuming fruits and vegetables_ including juices_ that are high in potassium that seem to keep the blood pressure at acceptable levels; I'm also focusing on weight loss (minimizing desserts) and more walking exercise which worked well in the past. From a causal standpoint_ it may very well be that if the medication relaxes the heart muscle_ it probably works systemically such that it affects the eye muscles as well. It's not worth risking potentially persistent and permanent eye damage. I've subsequently undergone thorough eye exams by an optometrist and ophthalmologist_ days after the incident_ both of whom could find no underlying physical cause for the double vision. Additional examination by a neurologist is planned as well.,M,65,25  days10 MG 1X D,12/19/2012,Bystolic

Also feel itchy and have headaches in the back of my head towards the top.,I have no idea why I'm even taking this drug.  My bp was slightly elevated due to extreme stress.  Had every test done imagined to man kind and no heart issues_ diabetes_ or anything. The cardio doc does not know if I even need a bp med at all so the med has been cut back to every other day and when I take it the ringing in my ear is awful drives me nuts.  Cannot lose one pound no matter what I do and I have never been over weight. Also I noticed when I do take the med my heart does flip flops for about 10 minutes and don't understand that.  Doc also says this med has NO side effects.  BP is almost excellent but it never was high at 135/85.  I have changed diet and lowered cholesterol to a good rate and they want me to lower it even more makes no sense.  Tired of being tired for no reason and too young to be this tired and I get plenty of rest. Does anybody know if you have to actually be weaned off this med since I've taken it so long? I tried about 10 different bp meds before the bystolic and started out at 5mg and that was too much the other normal bp meds I did try were the lowest dosage they came in and I was so sick plus bp dropped way to low.  Makes me think I don't need any bp med at this point but isn't that what we pay these doctors for?  I have explained to him the symptoms I do have he says my bp is excellent so he is dumbfounded so instructed me to take every other day.

As an added point of interest the original diagnosis of CHF was wrong - we were recently told by two cardiologists that she does NOT have CHF_ and could not possibly have had it back then (based on a perfectly healthy ejection fraction now)_ but she does in fact have pulminary hypertension which she could have been receiving treatment for this entire time.",F,88,  1X D,2/19/2012Email,Bystolic

I thought it may be because I had a new puppy and thought my alergies were making my asthma worse.  Then Bystolic wasn't working on my BP_ so the doctor double my dose to 5 mg.  At that time_ I was having to take an inhaler for my asthma multiple times a day.  Then_ when the higher dose didn't work_ the doctor switch me to Avapro_ and now all of my asthma has subsided!  After researching Bystolic_ I found that it is a beta blocker that blocks beta receptors.  The problem is a lot of beta receptors are in the lungs and Â“airway structuresÂ” and when the beta blocker blocks them_ they become more tense and constricted_ which is dangerous for people with asthma.

On a couple of occasions my BP would become elivated and my doctor would increase the dose to 50 mg but at that dose I become short of breath on exertion.  At the beginning of 2010 my GP increased the dose because my BP was going up and the shortness of breath was right back.  I went to my cardiologist for an annual check and told him about the shortness of breath and he said there was a new wonder drug that far surpassed the old beta-blockers in effectiveness and the way it works.  The wonder drug?  Bystolic of course. He put me on 10 mg. Gradually over time the side effects have gotten worse.  I saw him this week and I complained about the Bystolic but he stood by his high regard for this drug. He did agree to take me off of it and put me back on 25 mg of Tenormin.  He gave me no instructions on how to wean off of it or that going off of it slowly was even necessary.  When I came home and looked over the drug sheet they gave me at the pharmacy_ slow weaning was presented in a warning.  My theory is that many physicians know very little about the drugs they prescribe aside from what they hear for the drug reps.

I have a muscle bridge at the LAD. My doctor switched me to 10 mg of Bystolic and at first I thought it was a Godsend. Then_ I'd wake up at night with the sweats_ high pulse rate and elevated BP. Cardiologist upped meds to 20 mg. Had a severe hypertensive event in the middle of the night. BP was through the roof. Chest pains. Profuse sweating. Shaking all over. Upped meds to 30 mg. Early December 2009_ I was drinking a glass of cold vegetable juice and felt my heart flutter. Put my hand to chest_ and my heart was going nuts. Went to emergency and was treated for Atrial Fibrillation. Upped Bystolic to 40 mg (maximum dose). Added second med to control A-Fib: 200 mg of Amiodarone. A few weeks ago_ I awoke in the middle of the night with another HBP event_ but this time I felt chest pain and pressure across my ribcage. Cardiologist did stress test_ echo cardiogram_ nuclear heart scan and angiogram. Everything normal. I workout at the gym 7 days a week. I am a vegetarian. And I really watch the sodium. Yet my BP is still unstable_ and I feel like absolute crap. My cardiologist now wants to blame my BP attacks on stress and anxiety. I've had it! I'm convinced that most of my symptoms are drug related. I'm getting a referral to another cardiologist. If you've experienced anything similar_ I urge you to be careful.

I still have the indigestion. Expensive. I am taking it along with 100 mg of Dyazide. I do not have any of the other syptoms described by others on this page. However indigestion and fatigue are serious problems to me. Other than over all fatigue libido doesn't seem to be a problem.,"I think I am going to look seriously at exercise and weight loss. As near as I can tell all of these meds have some problems. I think being tied to meds and a Dr. can be sympotmatically more scary than the disease symptoms.

So much pain that I can't stand to be touched and can't sleep due to pain. This weekend I started getting so out of breath with any exertion I felt as if I were hyperventilating. I got really worried so started looking online for forums on Bystolic and found this. Thank God for this this website. I have taken myself off this crap for medicine and have called my Dr for an appt to change medicines. I swear I think if I stayed on this drug I would have died soon.  It did help my BP and heart rate come down some but not worth the extreme side effects to me. I have NEVER felt so crappy. Been off two days and feel a little better. Hope I get back to normal.

I really do not remember doing any of these things....I know I was sleepwalking. I think I let my dog out when I went to use the bathroom and then dead bolted the door when I let her back in.

343, 5, ,I felt a little fatigued for about a month.  But then my body got used to the medication and no side effects whatsoever.,Bystolic is an awesome medication.

344, 2, HBP,"5mgm dose.Lost all interest and sense of initiative. I felt ""shutdown_"" so to speak. Not depressed_ I just did not want to do anything much. Stopped reading_ emailing_I cleaned my apartment_ and shopped only when I had to. Tired or lethargic most of the time. I find it difficult to explain how I felt. More like a vegetable_ perhaps.  Also_ some upper back pains as my BP was low. I thought that my BP must be running high when I had the pain_ but it was normal to low normal.",I used it at night and took Benicar HCT 40/12.5 in the AM. It worked well for three or four years. Then it was not effective enough_ so my Dr. gave me samples of Bystolic to take in the PM. I had been walking_ going to the gym_ and functioning reasonably well most of the time_ although as my BP increased I had more bad days then good days.  The Bystolic took my BP from 140/90 and higher to under 130/70 with slower pulse_ as well. I was pleased with how it lowered my BP but after a week or two I felt as if I did not care about anything or anyone.  I would stop taking it for a few evenings_ and would start to function quite well again_ but had to go back on it as my BP increased. I tried taking half a tablet_ but that did not seem to change the problem after several days back on it.I am going to try Hyzaar_ no Benicar HCT or Bystolic.I do hope that the Hyzaar works without all of the side effects that I have read about.,F,69,5  months,1/20/2009,Bystolic
