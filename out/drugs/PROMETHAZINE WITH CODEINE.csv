0, 3, Cough,Severe headacheDizzinessTirednessDecreased urination ,This stuff is dangerous really is. Be cautious and don't over do it. I took 15 ml both nights before bed and nicked me out like a light to sleep and had no coughing but on the second morning when I had awoke I had THE worst migraine (never had one in my life) it lasted for several hours and was so excruciating I could not move hardly. It was my body withdrawing from the codeine. Sketchy sketchy,F,22,2  days5ml,6/6/2016,Promethazine with codeine
1, 1, flu_ severe sora throat,I almost went into a liver over dose failure . After 2 days of taking this medicine I couldn't walk. My motor skills shut down. I hallucinated. I tremored. I've never been more scared in my life.,I had tried this medicine prior with great results.  Maybe twice a year for 5 years.  I'd feel a cold coming on and would take a couple of  teaspoons and it coated my throat nicely and the sore throat was gone. However this last weekend with such severe flu symptoms I kept taking the medicine for the 3 times per day maximum allowed.  After 2 days of this I had acute liver failure.  Half of my body I  couldn't control.  I would fall down without any ability to control my body.  I fell down so badly -- uncontrollably -- that I almost busted my head open against the edge of a step.  This is the scariest thing that has ever happened to me. Please DO NOT ever take more than the recommended dosage. You will be sorry.  I feel thankful to be alive!,F,42,2  days2 teaspoon 3X D,1/20/2011,Promethazine with codeine
