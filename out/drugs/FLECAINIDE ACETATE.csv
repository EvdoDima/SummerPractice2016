2, 4, Atrial Fibrillation,lightheadedness_ dry mouth_ depression_ hair loss_ weight gain_ constipation_ fatigue_ blurry vision_ ringing in the ears_ bloated_ acid reflux_ feeling of air in stomach_ odd sensations in chest and stomach_ random headaches.,I was first started on lowest dose possible of Flecainide but within a month I was back in a-fib. My dose was increased and I have not gone into a-fib for 5 months now. That is great_ however_ the side effects of this medication have reduced my quality of life. My energy is depleted. The side effects come and go_ some lessen and another will crop up. When I first started taking this drug I was dizzy for 3 months_ tired and my mouth was uncomfortably dry. The dizziness lessened but there is a feeling of lightheadedness. Dry mouth is no longer noticeable. Fatigue continues_ unfortunately. My digestion has slowed down to a crawl and I am constipated with a feeling of trapped air in my intestines. Right after taking a dose of Flecainide I have acid reflux. My hair is thinning and ear ringing is increasing. My vision which was 20/20 is blurry and that is getting worse. When exercising I feel I have to pace myself so I do not become dizzy or trembly. After exercise I am exhausted.,F,61,6  months50MG 2X D,1/31/2014,Flecainide acetate
