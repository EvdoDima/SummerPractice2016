1, 4, Diabetes type II,No side effects noted_ except that it did not bring my blood sugar down below 130-140.  I could not tolerate GLucophage so the doctor switched me to glipizide.,Heck of a lot better than the side effects I had with Glucophage.  Just wish it brought my blood sugar level lower.  Actos was added to me regimen and now I have side effects again.  May have to go on insulin.,F,56,21  months,11/3/2008,Glipizide
2, 3, diabetis,WEIGHT GAIN_ 20 pounds in 1 year_ unable to get off.  Lack of desire to exercise as before.,I had been on Metformin 1000mg x 2 and Actos 30mg x 1 per day for one year with no results in lowering my blood sugar levels.  Added 5 mg Glipizide.  After being on Glipizide for 2 days all my counts went from 175+ in mornings to normal range around 125- mornings.  Impressive_ but I have no energy or interest in walking_ which I did 4 miles x 5 or more per week for 7 years prior. Now after a year results are no longer there. Lack of walking?? Don't know.  Did atkins diet_ modified with fruit and healthful diet for 3 months_ lost 1 pound.  Last time on it I lost 30 pounds in 4 months.  The weight gain is depressing.   Now at 5mg no longer working.  How much weight will I gain with higher levels?,F,49,15  months,4/15/2007,Glipizide
