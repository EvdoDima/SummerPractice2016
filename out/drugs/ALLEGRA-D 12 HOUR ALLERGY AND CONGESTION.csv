2, 2, Allergies,Shortness of breath_ extreme loss of appetite_ depression_ anxiety_ heart palpitations_ tired yet restless,I started taking this pill and it seemed great I couldn't find anything to work for my allergies except this. I have been taking this pill for about a year and eight months. In that time I have lost 20 pounds because of loss of appetite which was not needed. The side affects seem to get worse I have extremely dry mouth as well. I was at work the other day where I am always on my feet and had to sit down because I could not catch my breath and my chest was tight. I am a relatively fit person I run and bike often and have only felt theses symptoms after taking this pill. I thought suffering from depression was a normal part of life but when I don't take my pill for a few days I feel so much better. I've been restless almost every night although I take my pill at 6am and go to bed at 10-11pm. Please do not take this pill find something like a natural/holistic remedy or approach to your allergie problems.,F,17,2  years12 hour,1/4/2016,Allegra-d 12 hour allergy and congestion

I have tried every medication on the market to no avail.  My symptoms have almost vanished now!  I am thrilled with how this works!  I have also lost 24 pounds in 2 3/4 months_ but I needed to so that was a blessing.  Not sure how to stop the weight loss as food does not appeal to me in the slightest.  I do often feel a bloated feeling very high up in my stomach.  As if a tennis ball sized object was lodged right between and just below my breasts.  I think that is why I feel like I can't eat.  Most  days its all I can do to eat one small meal.  Somehow_ I have no side effects from not sleeping or eating!

Went to the Dr. He said it wasn't Bronchittis_ think its my allergies_ gave me samples of Allegra-D® 24 hour (fexofenadine HCI 180mg/pseudoephedrine HCI 240mg) Extended- Release Tablets_ also some antibiotics for 5 days just in case something was going into my chest.

Sneezing/running/stuffy_ awful! My allergies have never been so bad. This is August '09 & it started in beginning of July. It totally clears up my nasal congestion_ running nose/sneezing_ and also helps with tightness in my chest/breathing problems that feel like asthma(in which an inhaler helped temporarily).

Beyond that_ I do feel a chronic low-level caffeine-type high_ which isn't necessarily bad_ as long as it's not having a long-term affect on my heart...,I found that if I take it right before I go to bed_ I sleep like a rock_ and wake up maybe an hour earlier than I do in the winter (without Allegra D)_ but feeling completely refreshed. As for efficacy_ it works wonders for my seasonal allergies! It's enabled me to quit asthma steroids_ which have much more terrible side effects. :-(,F,42,3  years,3/14/2009,Allegra-d 12 hour allergy and congestion

I can actually breathe and if I take this in the morning_ there is no problem sleeping in the evening. And I have no more bloody noses from my sinuses being so irritated from the allergies.

When I got to work_ my hands were shaking and I was extremely jittery.  It is now 2:05 pm and Im still feeling the same... and I smoked about a half of a pack of cigarettes already_ which I never do.  My ears are still blocked_ but of course I only took it for one day so far.  I can't say I enjoy being so jittery all day_ but I havent had a single thing to eat today_ so it definitly suppressed my appetite.  I don't think I will be taking this pill again anytime soon.,I wish my doctor would have told me about the side effects.

I have mild hypertension and my BP not affected at all but heart rate jumps by about 30-35 periodically during the day. Also am mildly diabetic and this has not changed my readings nor apparently has the antibiotic.,Today was my last Levaquin; i requested a few more samples of the Allegra D from doctor and got them -- wonder if I had a sinus infection at all since I am really just about the same as when I first saw the doctor and have finished my Rx.

He told me that they found crystal meth_ which shocked me because I don't even drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. To make a long story short I found the fact about the pseudoephedrine.

When combined with more than a couple cups of caffiene I was thrown into a severe panic attack_ and almost blacked out. When taking one Allegra D a day_ could tolerate a small amount of alcohol_ when taking two a day_ imopossible. Allegra D makes any  of the effects of alcohol about 3 times as strong..one glass equals 3. This med makes me extremely nervous_ makes my heart race_ makes me sweat_ gives me what i would describe as hot flashes_ makes me dizzy and disoriented_ muscle aches in my neck_ back and legs_ more severe menstral cramps_ a feeling of being disoriented_ diahrea_ all of these symptoms come and go from time to time...everyday is different_ with the exception of insomnia. They worsen when I start taking it twice a day_ and lessen with the oppostite. Unfourtunately my allergies are so severe in the fall and spring I'm even WORSE without the med. Alegra D works like nothing else to control my seve,"When I quit taking it in the past_ although the drug facts say there is no ""withdrawl symptoms"".....I was incredibly weak_ exahusted_ had severe headaches and muscle pain...this lasted about 4 days. Like having the flu but much worse. It's been two without it so far and I still can't do anything that elevates my heart rate without becoming incredibly dizzy and breathless...this is my second attempt to get off this drug....i have also been taking singulair with it for 7 months.

For me the use of a 12 hour sudafed had the same results.

On days when I do get enough sleep I have more energy_ but it's productive energy (no irritability or anything).,Don't take one within 3-4 hours of bedtime though_ or you'll never have a restful sleep.
