4, 2, ,initially euphoria for about an hour_ then severe dizziness and overall sick feeling. Seemed to interfere with sleep too_ even though it made me tired.,I took this as Percoset after dental surgery. It helped some with the pain_ but the dizziness and other side effects were not worth it_ especially since I couldn't get good sleep_ which I really needed.,F,46,1  days5/ 500 1X D,3/4/2013,Oxycodone and acetaminophen
5, 2, rotator cuff surgery,after about a week_ cloudy urine_ finally difficulty urinating - scary.  Drowsiness_ but that's okay with me after surgery.,It did ease the pain well_ I just couldn't tolerate the bladder problems.,F,52,2  weeks 4X D,7/17/2012,Oxycodone and acetaminophen
6, 3, Rotator cuff surgery,UTI,I am repeating the surgery next week and am afraid I will continue to have side effects.,M,45,4  months5-35 4X D,8/4/2011,Oxycodone and acetaminophen
7, 3, 2 ruptured disks_ spinal stenosis,Helped relieve the pain immediately which was initially great_ but had two different generic versions_ endocet then oxycodone by watson.  Watson's version really caused serious rebound headaches for me that were unbearable usually several hours after I took my dosage. Pharmacist said this was not uncommon when their is a change in manufacturer.  Had to have my surgeon prescribe Percocet by name_ no substitution which resolved the headache issue.  Other effects - Dry mouth_ some itchiness in nose and of course the usual buzz.,After prolonged use it really started to effect my sexual performance & desires in a very negative way which ultimately led to increased anxiety.  This led me to reduce its use and look for alternatives with my doctor.,M,51,2  months7.5-325 4X D,7/5/2011,Oxycodone and acetaminophen
8, 5, ankylosing spondylitis_ fibromyalgi,euphoria_ drowsiness,This medication replaced Vicodin for me_ and works much better but it doesn't last all that long. I probably would have preferred a long-acting version of this. Overall_ there's not much to complain about. The pain relief is profound and I am able to function normally with no nausea.,F,36,1  days10/325 4X D,3/17/2011,Oxycodone and acetaminophen

10, 3, spine subluxation & b.s. about pain,intoxication/euphoria and dependence,I would recommend methadone to relieve pain without the risk of addiction.  use vicodin as a recreational drug only.,M,52,20  years10mg/325mg 2X AN,9/29/2010Email,Oxycodone and acetaminophen
11, 1, First time w/Rheumatoid Arthritis,Extreme itching_ hives_ welts and a very ill feeling_like dying with nausea.,It did not make a difference with one pill_ nothing_ nada.  Two pills just allowed the pain occur_ but without an edge_ slightly duller_ as long as I didn't move much.  Otherwise it didn't do much.  It was some cheap generic version.,M,47,2  days2.5mg 2X D,6/11/2010,Oxycodone and acetaminophen

13, 4, TMJ and neck pain,just what i thought it might be...the high buzzed feeling for first few days. nothing else noticable.,much better than a lot of other pain meds! i just take it PRN_ not daily.,M,37,6  months,11/23/2009,Oxycodone and acetaminophen
14, 1, 4 wisdom teeth extracted/dry socket,racing heart/ feeling of panic/ felt like I was coming out of my skin,I was only 19 years old when I took this medicine. My full dose was 2 tablets. I had the reaction to the full dose.  The Oral Surgeon told me to try again_ but only take 1 tablet. I still had the same side effect. It's been over 25 years since it happened_ but I still remember how awful it was. I felt like I was dying and I was just counting down the time until it was out of my system. I've never taken it again_ and am always sure to tell the ER_ or a new Physician that I don't tolerate this medication.,F,47,2  times,7/28/2009,Oxycodone and acetaminophen
15, 2, pain from herniated disk,weird dreams_ especially just before that falling asleep state -sleepiness,Unfortunately_ it did not really relieve the pain as much as I would have liked.  Stopped taking it and resorted to 600mg ibuprofen_ also prescribed,M,59,2  days,4/17/2009,Oxycodone and acetaminophen

17, 2, 4 wisdom teeth removed_ 2 impacted,Not really any side effects_ except I was kind of zombie like.,To be honest_ after two-three hours the pain was back and it seemed as though the more i would take it the more out of it I would become but the pain was never always gone. It was annoying and I eventually switched to taking hydrocodone which seemed to conquer the pain much better.,F,22, ,3/12/2009,Oxycodone and acetaminophen

21, 4, nerve damage pain after surgery,"fatigue_and a ""high"" feeling.",it helped take away the pain_ but i would take it and then fall asleep within 20 minutes. If i woke up during the 5-6 hours i would sleep_ i could never feel my legs or arms for some reason_ it was really weird. but it helped a great deal with the pain.,F,16,3  weeks,7/8/2008,Oxycodone and acetaminophen
22, 4, Nasal surgery pain,I was on this drug for a week (every 4 hours) and I watched an entire box set of Gray's Anatomy and don't remember any of it! But I had no pain! I also had a horrible dry mouth. I ended up moving a chair into the bathroom and turned the shower on for the moisture_ it didn't work. I don't remember moving the chair_ I was super strong I guess. I also drank 5 gallons of water in one day for more than 3 days straight cause of the dry mouth.,I was taken to the hospital with an anxiety attack and was given the percocet version and broke out in a horrible hives rash. I also ended up having very bad clausterphobia. I ended up walking around my condo complex at 3am_ all drugged up because I just couldn't be inside anymore. (oh and I don't remember),F,27,1  weeks,4/1/2008,Oxycodone and acetaminophen
23, 4, rheumatoid arth_spondylitis_fibro,weight gain,I take Percocet for chronic pain. It helps and does not make me loopy or sleepy. Percocet is oxycodone plus acetaminophen.

24, 3, Wisdom Teeth post extraction,Dizzyness_ slowness of breath_ racing heart rate_ sweaty palms_ dryness of mouth,I was perscribed the 5/325 tablet to be taken every 4 hours by my oral surgeon.  Explaining to him that I had trouble taking pills it was expressed to simply crush it (I know about time release and brought it up but that didn't seem to be a problem when I did).  Having never taken an opiate derivative before and nowhere on the directions did it say crushing was bad_ I crushed the tablet and took it with fruit smoothie.  Fell asleep and awoke about 5 hours later.  I took another one as prescribed after I crushed it and took it with a glass of water. Not more than an hour later I started to get sweaty hands and feet_ shortness of breath_ racing heartrate_ dry mouth.  This drug ultimately makes you sleep and reduces pain with the acetaminophen.  All I can say is crushing it may have lead to the effects  I experienced_ too bad I wasn't told this nor did I read it till after the fact.  Scared the shit out of me_ and came close to going to the hosipital given symptoms (i.e. shortness of brea,M,30,1  days,4/1/2007,Oxycodone and acetaminophen

26, 5, Surgery,Itchiness,These are good for short term pain relief. I only took when needed after surgery_ which was about two 10's a day. Took them for 2 weeks_ then tapered off to only 1 evey day because the first 24 hours I didn't have one_ I felt immediate withdrawl symptoms. Very addicting_ when you decide you no longer need them for pain_ taper off slowly_ don't stop cold turkey or it will be hell.,F,27,3  weeks,4/20/2006,Oxycodone and acetaminophen
27, 5, broken arm pain at night,,See Percocet - this is the generic name for Percocet_ whichis Perdodan (Oxycodone) with Tylenol (Acetaminophen).  Percocethas lots of reviews on this website.  The Tylenol is included tohelp prevent drug abuse_ I hear (can't disolve/inject_ or overdosewithout risking liver damage from the Tylenol).,M,50,3  weeks,12/28/2005,Oxycodone and acetaminophen
