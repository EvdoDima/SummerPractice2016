0, 2, urinary frequency,At first I had a very upset stomach and felt very tired. After 3 weeks my bladder symptoms started to improve_ but unfortunately I also experienced some breathlesness_ nervousness and the tone of my voice changed - it became deeper and quite strange sounding. I had to discontinue the patches for these reasons.,Effective on the bladder - but affects too many of the body's other systems too - anywhere that you have smooth muscle. (Lungs_ vocal tract_ gut etc.) Dissapointing. :-(( My bladder problems are ruining my life.,F,27,4  weeks3.9 mg 1X D,7/1/2010,Oxytrol
1, 3, Overactive bladder,Drowsiness at first_ but it went away after a couple of days.  Constipation was so bad_ no movement for a week.  I had to take Metamucil.,"This patch is much less potent than the pill form_ which makes it more ideal for daytime use.  I liked not being limited to bedtime.  I didn't exactly have an overactive bladder_ but I just had the SENSATION of having to go.  It was due to a stint in the ureter_ to unblock obstruction/swelling due to a kidney stone that had passed.  It gave me some relief_ but I still felt I had ""to go"" almost all the time.  It was the stint irritating the bladder or nerve_ alerting you you need to go.",F,46,10  days,6/5/2008,Oxytrol
