6, 1, Insomnia,Stopped breathing when trying to sleep. Extreme anxiety.,Taking this was a complete nightmare. My husband had to sit awake all night with me to make sure I did not stop breathing. Absolutely terrible experience. Was taking it for sleep and it ended up keeping TWO people awake for the whole night. I cannot believe this med is so widely available over the counter,F,53,1  days25mg 1X D,12/6/2015Email,Phenergan
7, 1, Sleep,Difficulty breathing_ tingling_ dizziness,I will NEVER take this again. I took it to help me sleep since I suffer from chronic insomnia_ it made me extremely tired but - the downside was I was struggling to breathe. Every time I fell asleep I woke up quickly_ franticly trying to breathe. My whole body was tingling with pins and needles and I felt really strange and out of it. Once I finally fell to sleep I had the most restless sleep yet_ and ended up sleep walking. I've never sleep walked in my life and it hasn't happened since taking this medication. Not pleasant.,F,20,1  days 1X D,10/22/2015,Phenergan
8, 4, Food poisoning,Relaxed_ tired and no more nausea.,I got really ill from food poisoning and this stuff took away the nausea asap_ while allowing me to relax and sleep well. I took it as a suppository and I'm sure that's why it worked better than the pills.

11, 1, Severe nausea and pain,vomiting_ syncope_ convulsions_ and respiratory distress. I stopped breathing.,I was given this medicine via needle 3 times_ and each time my reaction became more severe. The nurse told the doctor that I was having these reactions_ but he wouldn't listen to her_ and ordered more.

Nasty crap.,F,27,1  days 3X H,10/2/2014Email,Phenergan
12, 1, Nausea,Had an upset stomach so took half of a 25 mg pill. Worked well and made me very sleepy so I went to bed. Woke up 20 minutes later and felt like I was losing my mind. Stayed awake for a half hour and began to regain myself. Went to sleep again and within minutes woke up and felt crazy again. Do not take this unless you are very sick.,,M,27,1  days12.5,9/17/2014,Phenergan
13, 3, pain- help Dilaudid work better,Wow. Most Physicians around here (Western PA) don't prefer to prescribe this med anymore due to its side effects_ lasting side effects and irreversible side effects such as tremors. I was given 10mg of Dilaudid combined with 30 mg of Phenergan every 2 hrs for a Kidney stone_ which I was prone to. I was given a high dose of pain med because I'm on 75mcg of fentanyl X72hrs patch and 30mg of Oxycodone X3 daily. I felt SO high. Confusion_ extremely tired_ tremors_ talking but not making sense. (Like I was drunk) I was kept over night for observations and was given this combo every 2 hrs. After awhile_ I didn't like the feeling but it worked. Now_ I prefer Dilaudid combined with Zofran. * Feel free to contact me with pain issues and other issues you may have.Mr. Robert N. Davis,,M,37,10  times30mg,7/16/2014Email,Phenergan
14, 1, Pain- given with Demerol,"At that time I felt bad burning up my veins. They had to redo my IV site 2-4x's a day from veins ""burning out""","I had severe bowel obstruction_ if I did not eat I had no nausea. I asked the nurses many times to stop this med. Dr. wanted it given just ""in case"" & to increase Demerol effect. I got an IV shot almost every 4 hrs for 3 wks.They had to put in a central line because my veins were bad. NOW> I have only 1-2 places where they can put an IV or draw blood.

30, 3, Nausea,This caused Cervical Dystonia (a neurological condition).  My neurologist said it could.  Here is a list of drugs that can cause Dystonia:  lifeinpain.org/node/3.,It also caused sleepiness.  I like Zofran a lot better.  Zofran didn't cause Cervical Dystonia either.,M,49,7  days25 mg. 1X D,2/6/2012,Phenergan
31, 5, Insomnia_ nausea_ allergies,I find phenergan an extremely safe drug and useful for several conditions. Primarily taken at bedtime to allow relaxation and sleep. I took this every other night for years with minimal side effects_ but it does produce poor quality_ light sleep and nightmares_ and a little weight gain. Since reducing to only a couple of nights a month_ my sleep quality has improved and i no longer rely on it. No long term ill effects that im aware of. Experienced a little increased anxiety and moodiness_ and obviously some difficulty getting to sleep at first_ upon withdrawal.,,F,25,4  years12.5-25mg,1/23/2012,Phenergan
32, 4, seasickness,Drowsiness_ flushing_ nightmares,Prevented vomiting from seasickness_ though it didn't entirely eliminate the nausea. The drowsiness wasn't actually a bad thing - sleep is the best cure for motion sickness_ in my opinion. Felt like a zombie the next day_ but that's much better than barfing.,M,31,1  days25 mg 1X D,1/23/2012,Phenergan
33, 1, Pain with nausea,I have taking Phenergan for years off and on.  I even had a zofran pump when I was pregnant with my son several years ago..  Recently I have been taking Phenergan a few times a day for a few weeks and I started having awful spells where my vision went crazy and I had right hand tremors-- it was very scary I wouldn't suggest anyone take this drug for long periods of time!!

I've grown tolerant to the sedative effects_ after about 3 months continuous usage (not daily_ but 3-4x weekly).",Works AWESOMELY for my nausea/vomiting_ but only certain types.  Flu-like nausea_ airsickness_ and food-related nausea respond well to Phenergan for me.  However_ I get weird vertigo/nausea/vomiting (from reading_ or sometimes just randomly).  Phenergan doesn't touch that (only good weed does).,F,28,7  years25mg 1X AN,11/15/2011Email,Phenergan

47, 3, nausea,Nightmares_ hallucinations_ tremors_ extreme fatigue,Phenergan_ at first_ seemed like it would be the miracle drug I've been looking for. I am prone to anxiety with nausea as a result_ especially in airplanes. I figured that I would save some of this medicine for when I travel but there is NO WAY I will even consider it. I took it last week for some nausea (relating to flu). The first 6 hours were fine (I slept through 4 of them)_ but afterward I felt very jittery - my fists clenched by themselves at one point. I fell asleep and then woke up only to find I was actually still dreaming. I experienced sleep paralysis (lucid dreams_ too_ but not the good kind) which was terrifying. The next day I was SO TIRED even though I'd just had 8 hours sleep. I will never take it again unless I can't stop vomiting and there is no choice. It DID help with the nausea_ but the rest was just...yuck!,F,27,2  days 3X D,5/19/2011Email,Phenergan
48, 4, severe pregnancy nausea and vomiting,Very sleepy_ strange dreams,I have to say_ I appreciate this medication.  I suffered severe nausea and vomiting from my pregnancy and was on the verge of being admitted to Tue hospital for dehydration and malnutrition.  For me_ the benefits outweigh the risks.,F,30,4  months25 mg 2X D,4/19/2011,Phenergan
49, 5, Nausea from migraines.,My doctor originally prescribed Phenergan for the nausea that comes with my migraines.  I have found_ although it does make me sleepy_ it also takes away almost all of the migraine pain 90% of the time.  In addition_ I have not experienced vomiting in years.,It does make me sleepy_ but also takes away the pain and nausea of migraine headaches.,F,67,6  years10 mg 1X AN,3/9/2011Email,Phenergan
50, 4, Severe nausea_ Vomiting,I wanted to lay in bed all day because I was so tired and I am actually on it now and it has been a hour and a half and it has taken no effect yet.,It's great through an IV but man in pill form it really sucks for me. It takes way to long for it to start working. I took it for the first time three days ago and I held it in for an hour and finally puked it up. It just does not seem like it wants to work on the spot for nausea.,M,18,3  days25 MG 3X D,12/20/2010,Phenergan
51, 5, Nausea after surgery,As soon as the nurse injected it into my IV I stopped vomiting and passed out_ but that could be because I just came out of surgery and had been given other pain meds_ anesthesia_ and other nausea meds.,When I came out of surgery I was vomiting non-stop and the nurse gave me a nausea med. I don't remember what it was_ but it did not work at all so an hour later she injected my IV with Phenergan and it instantly stopped the vomiting and I felt SO much better. If I ever get surgery again_ I will be requesting this drug for post op.,F,25,1  daysIV 1X O,11/15/2010,Phenergan
52, 5, Nausea and Vomiting,Sleepiness and dry mouth,Phenergan is a great medication for nausea and vomiting!!  I have had Zofran for nausea and vomiting also in the hospital.  As many people on here have stated Phenergan is inexpensive and it really cures and wipes out nausea and vomiting!For anyone who can not take Phenergan I would suggest either Zofran or Meclizine.  These medications may cause you to have less side effects since everyone reacts differently to medication.,F,35,30  days25MG 1X D,11/9/2010,Phenergan
53, 1, post surgical nausea,After single dose (injection) was unable to speak coherently - could not make the words verbalized match the thoughts I wanted to communicate.  Thus unable to respond to doctor's questions re pain and nausea.  I also felt dizzy and anxious. Awful!,Will not take it or any phenothiazine again. After this surgery_ short term memory was significantly affected for months - computer tasks learned in a 3 month  intensive training immediately pre-op were not able to be reclaimed in the subsequent 3 month period.  However it is unclear which of the various anesthetics_ pain medications (which I stopped within a few days after leaving the hospital) or other meds contributed to these lasting effects on mental function.,F,55,  1X O,10/26/2010,Phenergan
54, 4, Nausea,Very_ very_ very tired the next day. Was completely out of it for about 24 hours afterward and really could not function well. No appetite_ just wanted to sleep and nothing else.,Did the job like a champ.,M,32,1  days25mg 1X D,8/28/2010,Phenergan
55, 5, Detox from methadone,Very easy sedation.  Side-effect so worth it compared to being in fetal position all night sick holding stomach.,I totally understand some peoples negative side-effects but when detoxing from methadone (possibly opiates but never tried when using)I'll take as much sleep as possible.  Also helped w/ massive insomnia that I had B-4 being given this_ what I consider to be_ miracle drug.,M,33,3  weeks25mg/50mg 3X D,6/7/2010,Phenergan
56, 4, Nausea from Depo shot,Sleepiness/lack of energy_ restless legs,After a few weeks of using this drug_ it doesn't make me too drowsy any more_ but it has started causing a restless leg syndrome-like effect. My legs have this awful creepy-crawly feeling that just makes me cringe. It's terrible_ but the nausea I had was worse. Sometimes after taking it I feel a severe lack of energy and I just don't do anything because I feel too tired to move.,F,25,1  months25 MG 1X D,5/25/2010,Phenergan
57, 5, vertigo_ nausea,"Side effects seem to vary each time I take it. The more severe side-effects are less frequent. Mild drowsiness; excitation; decreased comprehension and focus; verbal paraphasia (usually totally unrelated word but similar sounding_ example ""cajun"" instead of ""agent""); and the worst (only had this a few times) I feel agitated and anxious and feel like I have to do something with my hands: sometimes I ball my fists or shake my arms or rub/scratch when I don't have an itch; last time I had this urge to snap things in half_ I went outside and broke some sticks to spare my ruler and pencils and felt better afterwards.",I had been taking meclizine for my vertigo/nausea but it made me really drowsy and didn't completely relieve my symptoms. Last year I got the flu and my GP prescribed Phenergan for the nausea/vomiting. It worked really well for that and didn't make me nearly as drowsy as the meclizine. I read online about it being used for vertigo as well so I asked my doctor about it and started taking it for my vertigo instead of meclizine. The weird side effects kind of freak me out but generally I'm much more functional at work on Phenergan than on meclizine or nothing at all.,F,26,8  months12.5 1X AN,3/6/2010,Phenergan
58, 4, Allergy,Dry mouth_ lethargic_ tired_ no energy completely drained_ I literally sleep for two days after taking it.,I take the drug whenever a rash and hives come up on my body due to an allergic reaction which I don't know what is caused by.  Maybe dust mites or washing powder?!,F,24, 25 1X D,2/26/2010,Phenergan
59, 5, extreme morning sickness,a little sleepiness and dry mouth,This was a life saver for me_ my son would never had been born if I didn't take this medication! I didn't experience any of those horrible side effects others have. The benefits outweigh the risks_ as long as you aren't allergic and it is administered properly then it works.,F,31,9  months,1/3/2010,Phenergan
60, 5, nausea,The side effects were only one: drowsiness; and that was exactly what I needed!!  I went to sleep and woke up feeling much better!  I think some people on here are confusing the effects of this med with something else that happened to them.   You should always follow the directions of doctor so you don't take too much and you can make sure to take the appropriate dose for a first timer if that's the case to avoid breathing depression of any concern.  This is a first for me to hear such stories as on this site.,This is a medicine I have been taking since I was at least 15 and I am 27 -it is a miracle!  I would hate to imagine my life without this drug as I really hate being sick by vomiting.  I just had the stomach flu and so did a family member- they threw up for close to 6 hours and I only threw up the first time and went to sleep with my phenergan.,F,27,12  years,11/30/2009,Phenergan
61, 1, consious sedation for upper GI,Terrible pain at IV site. Terrible headache_ sweating_ full body muscle contractions. All complaints were ignored. Pheblitis_ nerve damage_ huge swelling in arm and a trip to the ER.,It has been five years since and no one should ever be given this IV Phenergan. I have constant pain from wrist to elbow and take 2400 milligrams of neurontin every day. Huge nerve damage.,M,63,1  times,11/24/2009Email,Phenergan
62, 1, N/V,Death by possible respiratory depression???  or just a coincidence???,I am a nurse and a co-worker nurse gave 12.5 IM of phenergan to one of her patients following normal protocol and five minutes later the patient died. Its not worth it...you never know what kind of reaction you as an individual will have so my recommendation is to try the absolute smallest dose first if you have tried other alternatives and you need relief(chronic conditions).  If you are having or had surgery and its just a one time thing I would recommend saltine crackers!!!,F,20,1  days,11/17/2009,Phenergan

65, 5, Nausea,Drowsiness_ unable to focus. If I take a whole pill one day_ then the following day I still feel kind of tired and out of it.,I have taken Phenergan for almost 10 years off and on for nausea. I have a very sensitive stomach_ so it's always came in handy. It can take up to an hour to work in pill form_ but once it does it's such a relief. Also helps allergies. Just make sure you don't drive while on this stuff. My doc also told me that this drug can become habit-forming too. If I take it_ I normally cut it in half and take 12.5mg instead of the 25mg. Seems to cut down on the drowsiness some.,F,27,10  years,8/31/2009,Phenergan
66, 5, extreme vomiting_ nausea_ stomach,Sleepiness_ a little spacey,I have had no problems with this medication. I have had it by IV in the ER_ but mostly use it at home by suppository. In the ER it was used with morphine. Yes it does make you very sleppy and can make you spacey. It does have some bad psychological affects for some. But I have had terrible depression all my life_ and had no psychological problems with the med. It is the only medication that can keep me out of the ER when I have bouts of diahrea_ nausea_ extreme vomitting_ stomach pain_ etc due to IBS and other gastro problems.,M,31,2  years,8/1/2009,Phenergan
67, 5, nausea,slight drowsiness_ occasional dizziness,I've been taking Phenergan/promethazine off and on for years for nausea (believed to be caused by IBS). I've tried dozens of antiemetics over the years_ both prescription and OTC_ and Phenergan is the only thing that works for me. The drowsiness is the biggest drawback_ but isn't that big of a deal as most of my nausea tends to occur in the evening or at night. It has the dded bonus of being a sleep aid for me I suppose.,F,32,15  years,6/7/2009,Phenergan
68, 1, Misdiagnosis of Labyrinthitis,I had symptoms of nausea and vomiting and was prescribed this medication along with Meclizine and was dizzy and very sleepy. However I was misdiagnosed it was a Stroke not a inner ear infection.,Four days later_ I had a 2nd stroke while taking this medication is my 2nd stroke linked to this medication? I'm investigating.,F,39,4  days,5/28/2009Email,Phenergan
69, 1, nausea and vomitting,I felt like i was losing my mind. would talk to myself_ hit my head against the wall_ almost threw myself out of a moveing car_ and felt like hurting others. I was like that for a few weeks. It's also happened to my son when he was 4 yrs old_ my brother_ and just recently my mother.,I was told by a nurse that many people have had bad reactions with this medication but doctors still use it because it's the cheapest medication for nause and vomitting.

It' still to over 5 hours befor she was her self again. she banged her head off the wall_ was fighting everyone_ and bruised her arms something awful_ she has a treak she was trying to rip that out. before a hospital gives this I think the side affects need to be told_ cause all we got was "" oh some people react like this_ until I went on the internet I had no idea how many side affects this drug has. this is unreal that they are still using this drug first when there are so many for simpe nasea",,F,33,1  days,4/30/2009Email,Phenergan
71, 2, Nausea,Hallucinations and convulsions,I was given this in the ER via IV. I began to have convulsions and also hallucinate_ but the ER had to release me anyway because they needed the bed.

72, 5, Migraine w/ nausea,Drowsiness_ dry mouth,People should also start listing everything else they take along with each drug they rate!I take 50mg of lyrica at night_ 60mg of cymbalta 2x a day and 200mg of celebrex at night.  I use 10/325 hydrocodone/apap for migraines along with either 25 or 50mg of phenergan.  I wouldn't dare take them all at the same time given that each of my drugs cause drowsiness but the phenergan and hydrocodone keep me out of the expensive ER.  I would be broke if I didn't have these to help with the 10-15 a month migraines I have.  Phenergan gets a 5 since I can live with the side effects.I see a lot of people leaving out their other meds information which can be very misleading and make others form a biased opinion of something that might actually help them.,,, ,2/28/2009,Phenergan

The liquid (without codeine or VC) is only 6.25 mg. of product per teaspoon so you can adjust your dosage. I've taken this for almost 10 years. It costs practically nothing and I have never had any side effects that caused any concern at all. Don't know what I'd do if they quit making it because I've tried all the expensive stuff; all they do is dry me out and make me jittery. All this and it helps nausea too!,F,53,10  years,5/23/2007Email,Phenergan

97, 5, nausea,extreme drowsiness_ dry mouth,"This drug has been a lifesaver for me. I initially started using it during my first pregnancy_ 10 years ago. I was unable to eat or drink at all and the phenergan took the edge off the nausea enough so that I could start to eat and drink again. I took it again when I was pregnant 2 years ago and it didnt work as well_ I ended up needing to take zofran. I only take it if I feel very nauseated and I also have to make sure that I am able to sleep because this drug KNOCKS ME OUT. Even just a quarter of a 25mg tablet will put me out for a good 6 -8 hours..if I need to take a half or whole tablet_ I'm out for a day. And the day after I take it_ I have what I call a ""phenergan hangover""...just very tired_ drained_ lethargic. It does the job_ though_ so I give it a 4!",F,35,10  years,3/13/2007,Phenergan
98, 1, Nausea/Vomiting after Surgery,I am sure it was more than just the Phenergan but this seemed to be the icing on the cake for me. I was taking something like morphine after my back surgery and was given a nausea medicine to stop me from feeling ill. After getting sick_ the nurse then gave me Phenergan. This drug knocked me out cold and I woke up to a bunch of emergency personnel and the nurse screaming in my face and shaking me to wake up in my hospital room. The doctor seems to think it was a cocktail of drugs that made me lose conciousness but that the Phenergan was also all it took to do that. It scared me half to death and I'd rather not ever take this medicine again.,After being knocked out cold I didnt feel sick anymore so I guess it did what it was supposed to_ but not being able to wake up and having no memory of it was really scary.,F,26,1  days,2/19/2007,Phenergan

102, 4, Nausea reaction to other meds,Drowsiness. I may have had too strong a dose_ becuase sometimes I felt like I would almost stop breathing during sleep which caused me to wake up repeatedly (and I don't usually have sleep apnea).,I was prescribed 25 mg tabs_ and they are almost too strong for me. Doc told me I could cut them in half if needed. This worked well to combat nausea. If this is administered in iv form_ it must be diluted or injected very slowly or it will burn and sting your veins. I still have soreness and bruises in my hand because of this - one week after. Otherwise a great drug_ just be careful of dosage since it effects people differently.,F,39,10  days,3/18/2006,Phenergan

Burning to the skin like I had a mild sunburn - mostly in the chest area. Also_ burned at injection site.,I would ask for something else first. This drug can also be dangerous in the elderly. Make sure person injecting drug goes very slowly to prevent burning.,F,34,3  times,2/23/2006,Phenergan
105, 5, nausea_ allergies,drowsiness,This drug is great.  It was the only thing that got me through my first two trimesters of both pregnancies.  It also helps with allergies/allergic reactions.

108, 5, Severe nausea,This stuff is cheap and works VERY well.  Especially great as a suppository.  IT stops severe upset stomach!,Did I say it's cheap and it works.  Everyone should have a few suppositories just in case you have sever stomach nausea.  When you can't keep anything down_ take one or two suppositories and it stops the convulsions and allows you to take in fluids.  Normally only need to take for 24 to 48 hours at most.  I've used only when necessary for years.  Easily addicting so don't abuse this stuff.,M,49,2  days,5/26/2005,Phenergan
