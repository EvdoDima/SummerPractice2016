5, 4, to stop smoking,About the time I stopped smoking_ a year ago_ now_ I started chewing the gum. I developed a swelling and mild discomfort in my stomach. Gastritis_ based on internal examination recently_ seems to be the problem. I see some comments here that link the gum's use to gastritis. The gum seems to induce me to drink more_ and excess drinking also seems to be a cause of gastritis. Curiously_ I mentioned to both my doctors who are in one way or another treating me for the stomach swelling and pain issues that I was chewing the gum. Neither said it would present a problem.Well_ I am so tired of the stomach problems_ enlarged abdomen etc.. that I'm going to make a sincere effort to cut out the gum and cut down on the alcohol. I have become addicted to that combination and its hurting my health. Gotta quit.,,M,68,1  years2 mg 10X D,6/9/2016Email,Nicorette
6, 1, To stop smoking,I never smoked till I was sick at 43 I smoked for six months and then started nicorette after three years I basically turned into a vegetable of doom and gloom I could not drive I thought I was at burnout within myself I was depressed and anxious and felt like I could not go on I stopped doing the basic things human beings enjoy in life I ignored the rashes the panic attacks and would not listen to my friends and family who were trying to tell me I had every listed side effect I had to have a gum 24/7 in my mouth while I slept,After three years I came off nicorette within five days I felt happy within seven days I could drive the car again at ten days I was listening to music.  But at 15 days the screaming addiction in my head and mouth was horrendous I had to get the doctor to prescribe a calmatives to knock me out I am not through the woods yet and this stuff is the devils own if I had not seen the difference the last month in myself I would not have believed it.

Previously addicted for 5 years_ went to addiction clinic for help_ got off the Nicorette but started smoking again. Not sure if any or all of my symptoms are a result of using Nicorette.  However I have undergone all sorts of tests and camera investigations and no obvious cause can be found for any of these problems.  Having now read other people's symptoms there is too much similarity for me to ignore the fact that Nicorette might be causing mine. I am going to do my very best to give up_ it's not going to be easy as I am totally addicted.,F,71,7  years30+ Mg 1X D,6/3/2016,Nicorette

11, 5, To quit smoking,Years ago_ I used the gum- that had adverse effects on my teeth. Quitting gum sent me back to smoking. Til I found the lozenges... Been using lozenges happily with no side effects. (They are just a bit expensive). I only use niccorete brand 4 mg MINI lozenges. The regular size lozenge would leave white marks around my lips. I am thrilled to have this product and be smoke free!,Highly recommend the mini lozenges to QUIT SMOKING!! If you're still smoking_ stop! That's a proven killer. It's a shame the government doesn't promote smokers to quit. It should be a top priority_ with more commercials and information about the hazards of smoking. Shameful to see how poor people spend their last dollars on cigarettes.,M,44,1  years4 mg,3/25/2016,Nicorette

13, 4, To stop smoking,For the past few years my dentist has been telling me i grind my teeth - which didn't sit right with me - and now i realise the damage is caused by chewing on this gum which has been eating away at the teeth and causing substanial damage on the side where I chew.,While brilliant at stopping me smoking I am addicted to it_ and had no idea that I was ruining my teeth - you need to be extremely careful with this gum. My dentist (UK) has no idea about the effects of Nicorette and dentists should be better informed.,F,59,15  years2mg 10X D,3/2/2016,Nicorette

I have previously tried chewing the gum for an hour and then adding a half piece of Trident for the following hour.  It helped tremendously with the anxiety and sleep problems.  I also found that I would go for longer periods of time without remembering to have another piece of Nicorette.  I am going to start doing this again and take it a step at a time as I gradually stop using altogether.,F,66,6  years2mg,2/4/2016,Nicorette

Extremely addictive,I have been taking the 2mg and or 4 mg mint lozenges since 2008_ and I had to have one in my mouth constantly_ it would come out right before I ate_ and go right back in after. Most of the time I had 2 lozenges in my mouth at all times_ upon waking until I was going to bed. I used zero discretion with these because it was better than smoking. I just have a sinking feeling that it must be corroding my stomach the way it is doing so with my teeth_ call it a gut feeling. I am on day 7 of quitting and I have been so moody and depressed and lethargic. I feel like a giant exposed raw nerve_ and I am extremely touchy and sensitive.

20, 2, To stop smoking,Hair loss_ bloating_ upset stomach_ mouth ulcers_ weight gain and inability to lose weight. Teeth coroded. Terrible wind! Feeling tired and generally unwell.,I've been on the 2mg lozenges for the last couple of years before that it was the 2mg fruit gum. It is highly addictive and I started to panic if I was going to run out.  I've been to the doctors for blood tests as I was feeling completely exhausted everything came back fine. I have been worried about the long term effects this stuff has on your health so did a Google search and came across this site. I had gone 24 hours without a lozenge and it spurned me on to kick this terrible addiction.  It's now been 11 days Nicorette free and although I found the first few days not to bad I feel quite depressed now. I'm gonna stick with it and hopefully won't feel so crappie as time goes by.,F,49,8  years2mg,12/17/2015,Nicorette

But then I got into the habit of constant use every day. After about a year I noticed my hair went very limp and ' dead ' looking and over the past month or so has thinned by about fifty percent. I've stopped taking nicotine for three days now and the falling seemed to have practically stopped. Phew. The best way to get me off it. Make my hair fall out !!  I wish I'd known this before.

If you are reading all these comments_ believe them there are too many comments for us all to be wrong. I noticed my hair falling out at and alarming rate and thought this was just part of the normal cycle. Trust me_ it's not and its just on for way too long. I am now on medication for severe acid reflux attacks and this was the final straw that made me stop taking this stuff.

26, 1, Stop Smoking,Hair loss - chest pains - teeth loss - torn bicep tendons - anxiety - mental confusion -small cuts never healing.,A regular pack of cigarettes contains around 15 mg of nicotine and when you inhale your lungs can only absorb around 10 to 15 percent of the nicotine. So when you smoke one pack cigarettes you are only absorbing around 2 mg of nicotine for the whole day.Now the problem with the gum and lozenges is that you are being told it is alright to overdose on nicotine for 12 weeks. For example_ one piece of gum contains 2 mg. of nicotine which is equal to a whole pack of cigarettes. So what happens when you eat the maximum recommended dosage of 20  2 mg lozenges or pieces of gum a day? What happens is that you are now absorbing a total 40 mg of nicotine a day. That is equal to 20 packs of cigarettes a day!  Then if you eat the 4 mg gum that is equal to 40 packs of cigarettes a day! 40 packs of cigarettes a day!  You are also instantly addicted the very first week you use it. That is if you dont to start hick up and then throw up your lunch all of the time. Also I wish you some good luck when you try to go back to smoking cigarettes. I guarantee that you will be smoking at least 2 packs of cigarettes a day. In a way it would be cheaper to just pay the $70 a week for the gum. Then after all of your hair and teeth fall out your heart will stop. I am not kidding! But at least you will have stopped smoking.  Go into any Walgreens or CVS and look at what is right behind the cashier in every store across the country and what do you see?  You will see their most profitable sel,M,,1  years0 1X D,11/12/2015,Nicorette

I hide the nicorette gum use. Im with someone who doesnt know i have any more habits. Thats a whole other ballgame in itself_ but I did try to quit the gum a few months ago. Oh_ a few days went by and I was back chewing. Im hooked on the fruit chill 4mg. I can finally say I am ready to kick this habit for good. I dont know if this is linked to the gum or not but I have gained a lot of weight and I just have this general feeling of being unwell. My jaws hurt. Might i add_ i chew one after the other all day and i buy the little 20 count boxes. This is the most horrible addiction. I have been 10 years clean off meth and 16 yrs off cocaine and coming off all that was easier than this it seems. Now if I can just kick this habit and STAY quit and stop taking over the counter energy supplements_ Ill be very thankful. I guess im just scared of the withdrawals from it.

I knew a lot_ but it was averaging over $500.00 a month! So stupid!!!! I quit chewing the gum now over 2 weeks. What I did was: I bought the patch 21 mg for 1 week_ then the 14 mg for one week and now I'm on 7 mg for the last week. I also chew extra gum to help. So far so good.

Its only been a week since I have stopped the chewy_ but already I have noticed a massive difference in my hair_ nails and attitude.  I feel like my usual happy bubbly self and can't believe the difference in 1 week. Yippeee!  I am so happy!!!

50, 3, To stay off cigarettes,Gums have receded over half a centimetre in the side where I chew,A lot of the comments here are unfair. Nicotine is fiercely addictive. That's why substitutes like Nicorette exist to put nicotine into your system without all the other harmful stuff you get from smoking. Of COURSE they are addictive. It's our responsibility as a user to manage that. I failed to and I am currently addicted but I don't blame the manufacturers_ I blame me! Due to the damage to my gums from years of Nicorette abuse I am now going to try to quit Nicorette. Pity because I love chewing it.,M,44,10  years40 MG 3X H,7/3/2015Email,Nicorette
51, 3, substitute cigarettes,Hair thinning hiccups ear popping and air noises this went when my jaw muscles got used to chewing. Odd salty taste with original flavor as they contain sodium in 4mg,Hello to you all_ I am a 48 year old smoker_ around six years ago I gave up with no aid at all cold turkey_ around three months later I discovered blood in my stools and to cut a long story short was diagnosed with Ulcerative-Colitis. The symptons got worse as time went on_ these included a rash on my forehead with pimples_ Ulcers in my my mouth as well as other parts of my body_ poor eye sight and blurred vision_ painful joints. What surprises me is that 85% of sufferers of UC are ex smokers or smokers and affects 1 in 400 people in the Uk_ so it stands to reason that most of these symptoms would be attributed to any stop smoking aids. My new doctor had no knowledge of the link between smoking and bowel disease so therefore would have not have diagnosed my UC and himself blamed any alternative stop smoking aids. After 18 months of not smoking and I was nearly house bound with symptons so I started smoking again within 2 months was symptom free. I have tried all nicotine products and within 3 months my symptoms return. I know smoke 10 cigs a day low tar and consume around 10 4mg plain gum pieces and this is possibly the best combination for me. My gum symptons seem to be_ hair loss at fist popping ears wich seem to be my jaw muscles getting used to constant chewing and hiccups.What I am summerising is that some of these symptoms metioned in this and other sites could be caused by bowel problems that smoking has masked_ and should be explored as to get the best diagnosis.,M,48,6  months4mg 10X D,6/26/2015Email,Nicorette

Pain in both arms_ and legs_ It became so bad I was convinced I had developed bone cancer.  When I tapered off this gum and consequently stopped_ the pain all over my body did as well.  It made me hyper_ erratic_ moody_ argumentative_ almost manic in state.  I would rather smoke.  The wonderful thing about all this is since I have stopped using Nicorette_ my cigarette cravings are less than when I was chewing that gum.  It is a totally self defeating way to overcome the habit of cigarettes. Read Alan Carr_ anything if u must to change the BEHAVIOR of your habit.

57, 1, To replace smoking,Took lozenges and gum on and off for three years. I thought this was a foolproof. risk free way to feed my nicotine addiction_ and to mitigate the weight gain associated with quitting smoking cold-turkey (nicotine is an appetite suppressant_ and it boosts the metabolism). Side effects with gum and lozenges were actually different. Witht he gum_ my teeth and gums became sensitive_ and my gums bled more easily. I began to fear losing my teeth. The gum also made me more antsy and 'wired'. The lozenges had a more relaxing effect (I think because the nicotine in the lozenges is released at a slower pace). I did not have oral symptoms for using lozenges_ but I had digestive issues_ trapped wind_ painful digestion_ irritable bowels. Overall intake of nicotine temporarily and noticeably increased blood pressure. I would go from 70 BPM to around 85 BPM in a short time. I also tried electronic cigarettes. I found no noticeable difference between each delivery method (I was in it,Nicorette and other nicotine delivery methods will help you quit smoking (at least temporarily) but will keep you nicotine dependent. In this sense they are exactly like cigarettes_ but without the chemicals - the nicotine is the reason you are drug dependent_ the cigarette (like the lozenge_ or gum) is just the method of delivery.The use of NRT also brings with it health problems with long term use. According to anecdotal evidence from a large number of smokers_ prolonged use results in tooth decay_ hair loss_ tooth loss and digestive discomfort. I am now quitting with Allen Carr's EASYWAY. As cheesy as it is_ it works far better than NRT.,F,27,3  years4 8X D,4/8/2015Email,Nicorette
58, 1, To quit smoking,Seriously_ they should tell people that the gum is more addictive than smoking. I have ruined my teeth and gums and am not grinding my teeth_ probably because I don't chew at night... The cost is unbearable_ about £200 a month in the UK. I consume three boxes a week so 315 pieces of gum. This is madness. I tried to quit but I go crazy - the gum hits faster than the cigarette. Plus cigarettes are meant to relax you_ whereas the gum makes you very edgy. Pharmacists say 'you quit' - how can you quit when you are hooked on nicotine worst than before? One person at boots said I should speak to the pharmacist - how can I? These people never smoked! I wish I never started_ but this Easter_ I am locking myself in the house and will quit and I am sure I can find a better use for over £1_000 a year! Don't do it if you are thinking about it. It costs more than smoking!,,F,44,3  years40 1X H,4/2/2015,Nicorette

I couldn't focus my attention on anything_ except the fact that I had no more NICORETTE. My arm muscles felt as if they fly out of my skin_ and my skin was crawling.

I quit 6 months ago and have had a myriad of health problems that I attribute to using nicorette gum.  I began having skin issues and minor gum issues while on the gum.  I also developed MGUS_ monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.  This is a pre-cancerous blood disorder that turns into multiple myeloma or lymphoma in 1/4 of patients.  Nicorette gum is no healthier than cigs_ and no less addictive.  It kills just like cigs; must be the nicotene that is unhealthy_ not just the chemicals!,Nicorette gum is just as addictive as cigs.  Will still want it on my death bed_ which I will be on sooner because of it!   Caused me to have MGUS-protein in my blood _ which leads to terrible in curable cancer.

92, 1, to quit smoking cigarette,When i decided to quit smoking_ i immediately researched ways to quit without gaining weight. I know_ it's vain and truslt me i feel awful about obsessing about my weight for so many years of my life without giving a thought to my health_ safety and general well being. So in an effort to avoid weight gain_ i started chewing the gum and it worked well until i became addicted to it. Initially i would reward myelf with a piece after a long day of work or a study session. As a medical student aware of the risks involved_ i ignored the increased cravings i exoerienced for the gum and just kept buying it. Weeks turned into months into years and to this day i still cant stop chewing the gum. Ive been overseas to third world countries and worked with children who barely had food_ water. And still on these very Trips i came prepared with my gum and chewed it shamefully.  I know the physical addiction to the gum is related to the sugar content as well which makes it even more addictive. I am now insulin resistant and wonder if the use of sugar all day has contributed to this. I am thinner than ever_ which whoopdeedoo was my goal. But i feel horribly guilty about the money i spend on my addiction not to mention the root canals and current medical expenses_ i feel pathetic and really cant stand what i have done and continue to do to myself.

I quit tobacco once before around 20 years ago...I can't believe I got hooked on nicotine again.  Around a year ago_ I tried this 4MG gum & realized the buzz was better than snuff & I switched.  Something in the back of my mind always knew this stuff wasn't really good for me_ but I never added up all the symptoms and analyzed them analytically.  Right there on the box_ they say stop after 12 weeks...but nooo_ I kept going--just like everybody else on this blog.  Then--7 whole days ago--the switch flipped for me_ and I said to myself_ ""to hell with this""!  And I just stopped--cold turkey.  Stopping like that brought the situation to the forefront of my consciousness_ obviously.  And on day #3_ I discovered this blog.  Wow!  Once I faced the fact that I was saturating myself with this stuff_ I began to investigate it on the internet.  And I stumbled onto this blog--just like you did.  Then I began to think about all my symptoms over the past year--which had never been a problem for me in the past--and I was able to make the conscious connections.

I also noticed that most of the negative reviews were posted by people who have used the product incorrectly. I was a light smoker_ smoking fewer than 10 cigarettes a day but I really wanted to quit. The mini lozenges have been so helpful in helping me do it! I have followed the recommendations on the package and am on step three of weening myself off of them. They arent designed for you to be on them for  years. They are designed to be on for 12 weeks. I have been on them for 8 weeks and I havent noticed anything major. I have had 2 canker sores which I believe the lozenge has caused but that is minor in comparison to what smoking can cause me. Im grateful that I had this product available to me. I dont believe for one second they are more addictive than actual cigarettes. The amount of fake nicotine is much lower than that in actual cigarettes. I think most issues could be traced to the length of usage instead of the actual product.,F,41,8  weeks4mg 3X D,5/27/2014Email,Nicorette

Felt great until about two weeks ago when my mouth and jaw started to hurt a lot.  Just went for a dental exam because I was scared it might be oral cancer and thankfully was given a clean bill of health.  Now am convinced it's the Nicorette and I WILL be done with it within the next few days.  I am scared about what this seemingly safe product might do to by body.

MUCH to my surprise_ there were no withdrawals. I started chewing regular gum and I am fine. I am a ""mind over matter"" type of person though. I realized what this was costing me and did not want to continue putting chemicals in my body. Once i internalized that and made my decision_ I was fine.

This isn't a tool to replace_ this is a more expensive ""Brand"" of additiction which no doctor will say is bad for you.  They all will say use only for required time (12 weeks or so) then quit.  Yeah_ whatever.  I've fallen asleep at night with a lozenge in thinking these are just fine for you!  Hey_ they only have one harmful chemical in them (nicotine) compared to the hundreds in tobacco!  Only this is concentrated nicotine_ unregulated (sure it's FDA approved_ so was DDT_ sucralose_ and others).  This stuff will cause cancer_ straight up.

118, 3, 9 years of Nicorette addiction,Nicorette started out as the perfect alternative to smoking  while at work. Clean_ discreet_ fresh breath and my much loved nicotine buzz. 9 years later I'm 30 years old and chewing  10-15 pieces of 4 mg a day. That's a lot of nicotine I've realized!!! I'm chronically dehydrated_ nauseous all the time _ have unexplained weakness_ low blood sugar_ food cravings_ dry mouth_ racing heartbeat at bedtime_ heart palpitations and random tremors in my chest throughout the day and lightheaded ness a couple hours each day. All around I feel like something is not right but I've learned to live with my symptoms and tolerate then. Hard to remember what I use to feel like. If I don't chew the gum my symptoms drastically improve... Only problem is_ I'm addicted. Yes_ I will cry without my gum and the day just doesn't go on without it.

After years of not smoking (was never a heavy smoker) I stupidly bought a box of Nicorette gum thinking it would help me through a stressful time in my life_ as cigarettes had done in my 20s. I also hoped it would help me control my weight. Not so much. Turns out even moderate use led to hormonal changes and insulin resistance - both of which led to weight gain. It took two attempts at quitting this gum to succeed_ and I was a light user compared to many. It took a major effort that included exercise and nutritional approaches (controlling blood sugar with supplements -- cinnamon and alpha lipoic acid -- daily aerobic exercise_ and a diet rich in Omega 3s and low in carbs) to succeed. I did a ton of research_ then waged all out war against this addiction and finally won. The weight fell off in the process. My libido is back. The tinnitus is gone. Nicorette is poison. DON'T START.

152, 1, to quit smoking,Hair very dry and brittle_ falling out. Bloated_ painful stomach_ cramps and flatulence.,I finally managed to quit smoking last year but have become hooked on the gum. I used to smoke 10 low tar cigarettes that had 0.1mg of nicotine in each. Consider one piece of gum has 2.0mg I would have to smoke a whole pack of 20 cigarettes to get 2.0mg of nicotine!  So I went from approx 1mg per day to 20mg.I noticed my hair starting to fall out a few months ago; I've never had particularly thick hair so I can't afford to lose it at this rate_ my scalp is now visible through my hair. I didnt think it could be the gum until I read this. In addition I would have painful cramps and bloating.   After reading this forum I have stopped taking the gum. I did this by gradually taking less by cutting the gum in half then into thirds. It took about two weeks to get off completely.This stuff should not be available over the counter_ it should be prescription only. Im hoping my hair will stop falling out and hopefully will re-grow_ I have defiantly noticed an improvement in the amount of hair Im shedding. The cramps and bloating disappeared immediately.  ,F,41,1  years20 10X D,7/15/2013,Nicorette

I stopped 2 weeks ago and I am really motivated not to take it again. I used to have it in my mouth all day long and I used to get aggressive if someone would tell me I was addicted. I got tired of paying 14 euros for a box (I am in France but nobody seems to be aware of the side effects here)_ having bad breath_ stomach cramps and tooth decay (fortunately_ according to my dentist my teeth are really strong). Once you start this_ it is really difficult to stop as everybody tells you it is less dangerous than cigarettes. For me_ if you liked very much cigarettes_ it is better going cold turkey to stop. Nicorette is only good if you know how to stop. After 12 weeks_ it should be stopped. I tried to quit several times but each times it was a failure because I wanted my Nicorette. This time_ I am going 4-5 times at the gym per week_ instead of 2-3 times and I am drinking a tea when I want a nicorette but I am not really missing it. I am also taking a mint when I want one_ as I don't want to put on weight_ I avoid eating instead of taking a gum.

158, 3, To stop smoking,sore mouth; sore throat; occasional blood blister on inside of cheek; sore tongue; bloated stomach,I never saw any danger in taking Nicorette and so continued for many years.  I quite enjoyed it - gave me the same buzz as smoking.  Recently however_ I began to think it may be doing me harm.  I had muscle weakness and joint problems.  At any rate I guessed the nicotine and toxins were not going to help a condition like that_ plus I thought there may be a possibility of throat cancer if I continued chewing.    First I cut down to half a 2mg piece three times a day.  Not easy but bearable - just!  Did this for 2 weeks and then went cold turkey.  This was 2 days ago - day 1 was worse than I thought it would be - intense withdrawal symptoms plus I felt really sick plus I slept for England - day 2 was about the same with the addition of night sweats.  It is day 3 today and I feel a bit better.  I think I can do this now.  Good tip - drink fizzy water to help with the nausea.,F,57,22  years2mg 7X D,6/3/2013,Nicorette

If your going to use the lozenges congrats cuz its a great product but be cautious and use as directed not for years or you could go cold turkey with the product and smoking in general. It caused heavy heart burn especially when i first started using it and really messed with my stomach. Finally_ acne_ I never had acne kick in so hard for me even in my teens or while i was actually smoking but since i started to take the lozenges my face might as well be called mars....the red planet.

After 2nd week_ noticed little aches and pains in my lower stomache area and I became gassier than ever before_ but nothing to worry about. Into the 3rd week_ started to realize I can't keep gum tucked away for long periods of time and I catch myself chewing it like a regular piece of gum! Start realizing my insomnia I have been witnessing after week 1_ was due to chewing a piece an hour before bed. Some nights good sleep_ some nights not_ but gettin worse as the weeks go by.Week 4_ Wife also notices I am gassier than ever and smells worse than ever_ then comes some fierce hemorrhoidal pain_ comes and goes. Figured no big deal for 1st couple days into the 4th week. Then got worse almost unbearable. Then I got scared. I am 41_ exercise_ very healthy_ very fit and I have always ate healthy. My draw back was smoking. Researched the nicorette gum and side effects were very vague and not,Nicorette gum does take the edge off of wanting a cig._ but must follow as directed and adjust dose to suit you. Cut in half a 2mg piece and so on_ til the side effects are managable. Some of the side effects I endured were real painful at the end and made me get off of them asap.

190, 1, Stop Smoking,Was on about 20 a day (1 pack or so).  This is a poisonous drug.  Please take care.  The result of the 9 year stint of taking this is ; Hair Thinned; Resting Heart Rate 80BPM ; High Blood Pressure ; Teeth sensitive and falling out ; I have now quit in the last 3 months after going through painful dental treatment_ and I mean so painful that I wanted to put my head under a train.....Heart Rate has dropped to 55 BPM which is normal.  Blood pressure down to normal. Hair beginning to thicken up.  I feel much better.   My jaw feels odd but that is probably due to lack of chewing.,This is  still better than smoking however you need to get off it as quickly as possible.  This drug is not intended for long term use.

193, 1, To quit smoking,Tried Nicorette gum to quit smoking. The first piece I chewed gave me uncontrollable hiccups and a terrible stomach ache. I found that the gum actually made me want to smoke even more. I got a pounding heart from it_ as well as my blood pressure went from 120/80 to 165/110. I quit the gum after a month and a half and went back to cigarettes as they worked better and were cheaper than the nicotine gum.,If I was the CEO of Nicorette_ I would be trying to get electronic cigarettes with nicotine approved by Health Canada.,M,49,41  days2 mg 2X H,11/20/2012Email,Nicorette

I've recently had some health issues (palpitations) so I've cut out caffeine_ most artificial sugars_ and now just have the nicorette. 3 weeks after cutting out the caffeine the palpitations subsided enough that I've gone a few days at a time without them_ and I noticed them again today.

196, 1, To Quit Smoking,,"UPDATE: It's now 10/11/12 and I've been nicotine free 7/27/12 and i've never been happier. Finally ditched the 2 tubes of nicotine lozenges. The flatulence is back to normal or minimal if you want to call it that. For 2 to 3 weeks after quitting nicotine I was buzzing as if I had gotten high or drunk. I guess after 25 years all my body has known was nicotine. Maybe it was my body detoxing. It was scary at first but wonderful knowing I was going back to ""normal"" so to say. I still crave nicotine but the cravings are subsiding slowly. Too slow for my tastes but I take it day by day and if it get's too bad I have a sugarfree 2 calorie mint and it helps greatly.FIRST POST: I was a pack a day smoker for 20 years. Doctor gave me a breathing treatment when i got sick. I knew I had to quit so I quit smoking and started the lozenge. I hate I did. I should have just quit the smoking and been done. After 5 years of nicorette and the sams version of the nicorette. I have quit the lozenge and been free of nicotine for 10 days now with no desire to start again. I found this board when I kept having severe mouth sores. I swore it was the lozenge that was making it happen and after what I've read on here I was right. I immediately stopped taking them and I still have two and a half tubes left. The open one still sits in front of me but I refuse to take one. For so many years I've let nicotine control me. I finally got tired of it and I'm done.",M,41, 2mg 10X D,10/11/2012EmailHistory,Nicorette

I haven't smoked in the 21st century_ but I've struggled to stop this stuff.  There are no known problems of nicotine in the long term_ but I think this is probably because no studies have been done.

210, 1, originally to quit smoking Now Free,Nicorette free for 16 months now. I broke the chains of a 6 year addiction. No more making sure I have the gum close at hand every moment; in the car_ near my bed_ in the office_ at home_ when going out. No more chewing like a chipmunk and looking silly chomping on the gum. Of course I liked the stimulation the gum provided_ but now I get that by going outside_ exercising_ taking a deep breath and laughing. Being addicted takes away an individual's power to determine and decide_ this is psychologically debilitating and demoralizing. Breaking that addiction is empowering the freedom to choose.,I am thankful every day for being free of this addiction and I now enjoy counseling others. Now when I see people chewing gum it brings back memories of how strong this addiction was. Wow the grip of Nicorette addiction is strong_ yet the path to freedom is simple and straightforward.

I could chew it at work during moments of high stress.  The emotional toll it took was not positive. To lose so much hair at 32 was the worst thing that could happen. I never connected it until I thought about what had changed in my life and that was was chewing the gum. Your stomach is always bloated from all the air you take in constantly chewing. Your eyes are always red and dry. It takes such a toll on your physical appearance. Its sad to try and make a positive change such as giving up cigarettes only to experiance these severe side effects. Im chewing the last of my gum this week and then I'm done. I just hope to have some of my hair grow back and to get my body back in balance. Once the nicotine demon is off my back I'm never going back.  People can say what they want about Nicorette not being the cause of hair loss_ mood swings_ and all the other severe symptoms experianced_ but for me its because they don't want to give up their good friend nicotine and who would.

255, 1, To quit smoking,I get high off of it...it's a powerful drug. It's like crack in a lozenge (I use the mini lozenges_ same thing as gum_ more discreet). It's a weight loss tool_ it's a stimulant_ it's a mood enhancer_ it makes you feel elated. It is exactly like RITALIN_ CRACK or any other powerful stimulant. As with any drug that's similiar to an amphetmine_ when it's abused_ there are horrible side effects. Shooting pains up and down my arms_ hair is thinning_ my gums are receeding and my front tooth is cracked_ I can't sleep well at night_ I get racey_ forget to eat_ etc. If I use too much_ I get heart palpitations_ pain in my chest and my heart pumps so hard that I lose blood in my extremities_ causing my feet and arms to get really cold. I am well aware that there are horrible health consequences in my future due to it's use_ but I don't care because the drug LIES to me and tells me that it's not that bad_ that it's better than smoking_ that I'll quit before all of my hair falls out_ etc.,It's much_ much more addictive than smoking ever was. I can't even switch back to smoking cigarettes. I would LOVE to switch back to smoking cigarettes_ but it's too late. I've tried. Nicorette is incomprehensiably harder to quit because the withdrawals from Nicorette are way worse than the withdrawals from cigarettes. It is a much stronger dose of nicotine over a much longer period of time and you can use it anywhere without anyone ever noticing. It becomes a horrifying_ secret addiction. You end up hiding pieces in your house so you never run out. It's the same way an alcoholic might hide a bottle. It is the worst thing that has ever happened to me.,F,30,6  months4 6X D,1/22/2012Email,Nicorette

Nicorette or any other quit smoking aid is not made to use for years.  People are blaming these outrageous side effects on the gum_ try reading the instructions first! Taking any medicine incorrectly could cause minor to serious side effects.  It's only meant to be used for weeks_ not years.  Take a narcotic for this long and guess what_ you're addicted.

264, 3, to quit cigs & then to quit patches,gum probs_ bleeding gums_ sore jaw & teeth_ dry mouth_ the usual_ and then I realized many other symptoms may be related such as gas_ itching_ sore joints_ fatigue (see whyquit.com),I have been using nicorette and nicotine gum steadily for 2 years and off and on over the last 10 years. It is very addictive if you use it incorrectly like I have. It absolutely should be by perscription only. I decided to research what others were saying and I was shocked to learn that many of the symptoms I attributed to Celiac disease and Candida Albacans may just be this gum! Or maybe the gum created the immune probs and food intolerances. For those complaining of foul gas and dry mouth the answer is to switch to a brand or flavor that uses stevia or xylitol because sorbitol drys the mouth (listerine sprays worsen the prob) & is actually a laxitive (although commonly found in diet foods). But this is scary stuff. It consticts the blood vessles and can mask problems that won't show up until you quit the gum_ it is suggested that it may deplete gray matter and prevent the body from expelling toxins and dead cells. This product helped me quit smoking initially however later when I used it a second time I got hooked rationalizing that it's better than smoking. Well it might be just as bad or worse. I also believe that allowing it to be sold OTC is a ploy to create addiction and secure revenue. There is no other reason to sell this without a prescription. Plus adding flavors CREATES sugar cravings and addiction. Choose the orig flav or mint w/NO sorbitol. Sorbital creates the cravings and drys the mouth causing receeding gums and bleeding.,F,51,2  years4mg 10X D,1/7/2012Email,Nicorette

274, 3, To quit chewing tobacco,I have found Nicorette to be addictive but at the same time it helps you quit tobacco which is very bad for health. The best way of using Nicorette is to make your body comfortable without tobacco (a sense of confidence). Once it is gained_ quit nicorette. No need to use 12 chews a day as mentioned on the box. Use it when you feel strong cravings and make sure to handle those cravings for 15-20 minutes before taking Nicorette. This will build a sort of stamina in your body to handle these cravings in future (if required). Side Effects: ADDICTION,To all who want to quit tobacco: Reduce the daily intake before quitting. Reduction by over 50% will certainly help. Then switch over to Nicorette with 3-4 gums/day (4mg). Take it only when getting strong cravings. While chewing gums_ make your subconcious mind understand that this is not the solution and you are going to quit it very soon. Stop after 18 or 20 days. Ensure that there is no Nicorette left with you. Keep going turkey and believe me: The cravings will decrease drastically from the second day of going turkey.        I am now free from chewing tobacco after 13 years of addiction.,M,33,20  days4 mg 4X D,11/30/2011Email,Nicorette

Then its not so hard.2) Have lots of other gum around.  I like Mentos Fresh Mint_ Ice Cubes PeppermintSome people who keep chewing Nicorette think they're more addicted then they actually are.

306, 4, To quit smoking,None,Great aid to quit smoking. It is highly addictive because it contains nicotine. This is medication so in order to avoid the side effects that most people have had in this rating it is important to stop using it as described on the package. Example: Lozenges should not be used over the 12 week period. I was wondering why most people gave the Nicotine Replacement Products a low rating. After reading majority of comments I have learned that most people who had severe bad physical reaction to the NRT's have abused this medication and used it as a replacement of a cigarette over long period of time. The main goal of these products is to get off the cigarette and many hazardous poisons that tobacco contains. Nicorette and other brands can be helpful if used properly and according to guidelines. Remember it is a medicine.,F,38,4  weeks4mg 6X D,7/17/2011,Nicorette

316, 3, Alternative to smoking,Negative: extremely uncomfortable feeling in my throat at times during chewing.  (Took me 5 months to learn the importance of chewing it slow and letting it sit).  Increased heart rate_ trouble falling asleep at times if I chew it near bedtime_ can provoke anxiety/stress. Positive: I'm not smoking (I don't want cancer)_ I feel healthier than if I was smoking_ it gives me cognitive enhancement during tests_ stress relief at times_ relieves boredom_ quick acting antidepressant.,I'm sure I would be better off without nicotine at all_ but I'm relieved to know that I am not inhaling carcinogens on a daily basis.  Nicorette_ like other forms of nicotine_ seems to increase stress even though they also relieve stress (this is where much of the addiction lies).  I'm glad Nicorette exists_ but I wish they would lower their prices.  I think that if they did lower their prices_ more people might buy their products_ but as of now their prices are almost the same as buying packs of cigarettes.,M,29,5  months4 mg 6X D,5/21/2011Email,Nicorette

Took the gum a few times a day between cigarettes to wean myself off_ before stopping smoking altogether 18 months ago. At that point I continued to take the fruit or mint flavored gum_ which I had begun to enjoy as much as the cigarettes themselves. It seemed like the perfect solution_ a guilt free alternative to the fags. In no time I was hopelessly addicted_ and my consumption actually began to escalate. I would warn anyone reading this against ever using this drug_ which should be available on prescription only_ in my opinion. It is more addictive than cigarettes_ because you can be chewing anywhere_ anytime_ unlike cigarettes. Also costly. I would advise using the patches_ which deliver the nicotine in a different way_ and cut down according to instructions. If you must use a gum_ don't use the brands with the hard_ candy-like coating_ which taste very pleasant & consequently lure you in.

318, 5, To stop smoking,Hair thinning in general and one patch of alopecia (about 1.5 inches diameter_ totally bald). Weight gain & short-tempered.,The gum helped me no end for the 1st 3 months..... I doubt I'd have quit without it (now done 4.5 months).  However_ the hair thinning & bald patch concerned me_ so I googled the side effects of nicotine gum.... sure enough_ there's quite a bit out there saying that hair loss is a common-ish side effect.I stopped the gum 6 weeks ago and the bald patch is already regrowing.  At the current rate of regrowth_ I reckon I'll be back to normal in another couple of months (phew!).Other issues have been weight gain (no surprise there)_ and being a grumpy bastard.  I'll deal with the weight later_ and hopefully get less snappy as my body adjusts after 30-odd years of having nicotine regularly pumped into it :-)Overall it's been a struggle_ but well worth it.... hang in there!!,M,49,3  months4mg gum 6X D,5/19/2011Email,Nicorette

Never had any such problems before and I am 45.I saw 4 different doctors and got so bad my GP wanted me hospitalized. I got some relief from topical cortizone prescribed by dermatoligist who had never seen anything like it.He treated it like excema and psoriasis though he didn't believe it was either.I have suffered hair thinning as well as weight gain _sore joints.    I am now 4 days off the gum and I have stopped ALL medications to treat these conditions. ( 14 different medications have been tried )It is the only way to determine if  the gum is the cause.   So far... my ears are almost normal_my skin has dramatically improved and though my scalp still itches_dandruff has almost disappeared and the itching reduced. Hopefully my hair will improve and I continue to see the other symptoms disappear.

325, 5, To quit smoking,None,I used Nicorette Lozenges to quit smoking and was very successful with them. I only used them occasionally and only when I was really craving a cigarette. As time went on I was able to use them less every day. I only used about one quarter of the package I purchased (contained 100) because that was all I needed. This is also because they were so big that I had to cut them up to use them as one was way too much (for me). I did not have any side effects from taking them because I used them as an aid_ not as a replacement and only used them for a short time. I highly recommend them (it has been three years since I quit).,F,60,2  months 3X D,3/31/2011,Nicorette

After giving this up and searching the net for info? Yeah it was NICORETTE. I called the number to be greeted by a very stern customer help line person to document my case. I insisted anonymity but i really think there should be a class action lawsuit on this stuff. While it is helping people quit they reap the benefits of smokers everywhere by making it seem safe.. Well it's not.. read the pages and pages of side effects on here. How can we get a lawsuit going? I feel duped out of 2-3 years of my life. Even more-so than I did with cigs.email me.

However increased skin acne present with both. Sleep cycle reduced to 4-6 hrs per night. No other adverse effects. When i quit smoking_ several years ago_ I tapered off and quit Nicorettes afterwards. However_ over a year ago i started taking my left over nicorettes in a moment of stress and soon after began to notice increased emotional control AND cognitive enhancement such as the desire to read more books. Have kept chewing the gum for these benefits but am fed up with the constant acne (epidermal inclusion cysts) episodes which involve abnormalities in the (vellus) hair follicle especially on the nose_ cheeks_ chest and back.

I take this strictly as a nicotine delivery agent (yes I know it's wrong) but it's better than smoking.  I had problems with the gum with the mess_ the burping_ and my dental filling were lossening.  If you have these problems suck on the lozenges instead.  They are very handy.

368, 5, quitting smoking,slight sensitivity on lower teeth_ normal withdrawals expected from nicotine intake in general,I have been a smoker on and off for 6 years. Nothing has helped me more to quit than the nicorette gum. Recently I been away from cigarettes for 2 months now. I have used the nicorette gum. I started taking 6 a day with the 4mg dose. 3 a day then down to every other day. I find the only issue I have is sensitive teeth in the bottom portion. When i pack on the top no problems. Note: that all forms of nicotine may cause tiredness or insomnia. If you take mentally ill amounts of anything you can experience stronger side-effects. If you take the recommended dose and ween off like other people say you will be fine. I have weened myself off the gum before. I recommend take a good time off from work cause 1 week off the gum you will be messed up. That week my body felt like a tooth ache and I was extremely tired. The withdrawal symptoms are lessened by healthy eating and adequate exercise. I run 3.5 miles 5 times a week and lift 3 times a week. They didn't really screw up my lungs bad cause i am still able to run constant and far without any sort of breathing issues. Smoking cigarettes is a deep regret. It does take a strong mindset to quit! I even used to run while i was a smoker. I noticed since i quit its alot easier to breathe! I have experienced much more symptoms from smoking then chewing.

408, 3, Quit smokeless tobacco,I must have been lucky.  Used a variety of products over the years_ not just Nicorette.  No effects on teeth/gums.  When chewing more than usual sometimes got dry throat and coughing; I would just cut back for a couple of days and it would go away.,It most certainly is addictive.  The problem is that it works just like cigarettes or smokeless tobacco does--you get a quick fix of nicotine_ can regulate levels up and down as needed for stress_ etc._ and personally I liked the taste.  I have been off a few times but get major withdrawal symptoms.  Am quitting again and expect to succeed this time.  I have switched to patches_ which stave off cravings but don't provide reinforcement and are relatively easy to taper off if you do it gradually.  I have done this before but each time started again in a time of major stress_ after as much as a 6 month to a year period of being nicotine free.  I think I may succeed in staying off this time simply because (1) I know the pitfalls and have really researched the negative effects of nicotine by itself so I can't convince myself that it is relatively harmless_ (2) I have announced to my spouse and friends that I'm quitting and told them to abuse me thoroughly if they catch me chewing gum again; I did not do this before.  If you're using nicotine replacement to quit tobacco_ at least try to use patches; I think they are probably the method that is least likely to be addictive_ since they do moderate cravings but don't give you a basis for addictive behavior like gum_ and probably lozenges_ inhalers_ etc. do.,M,53,22  years2 mg 2X H,6/3/2010,Nicorette

But i have noticed side effects. FIRST is burping. Not a regular burp (like when you drink soda)_ but a real deep burp that feels like its coming from my stomach. Not that big of a deal_ and i can deal with it. SECOND_ i have a problem with heart burn_ hence the reason why i stopped drinking OJ over the past year. Since using the gum this seems to have gotten worst. Again i can deal with it. Its not totally out of control but defiantly uncomfortable. Some say chew slower_ i dont notice a difference though. THIRD_ i cant seem to fall asleep. But im not sure if its the gum causing my insomnia or if its just the fact that i quite smoking. I have read that people who qui,Because of the severe stomach pain i have been experiencing_ i plan in just using the box of gum. Once its finished im finished. I just hope i will be able to remain a non smoker and not use the gum. I am not looking to replace one addiction with another.

425, 3, Quit Smoking/Deal with stress,Nicotine Gum is crazy addictive; you come to love it.  I used to look forward to it; it was the first thing I thought of when I woke.  It's an excellent stop smoking product_ but it is too delicious.  I would chew it for the rest of my life... if it weren't for the side effects.  The gum makes your mouth taste like metal over time.  It will change the way you salivate.  You will end up eating a peice after every meal_ especially if you get the good stuff (NICORETTE FLAVORED).  My advice:  Buy 4mg and cut it into 1/3 peices.  Gives you about 1.33 mg of nicotine_ which is all you need to kill any craving.  You have to give the 1.33 mg section time to work.  If you smoked it_ the nicotine would hit you immediately_ but this needs to be absorbed into you blood stream_ so 15 or so is necessary. One piece by 2mg gum costs the same as 1 piece of 4mg gum.  By cutting a 4mg peice up_ you save money and only ingest a small amount. Don't buy the good stuff.  Buy generic nicotine g,,M,29,9  months4 10X D,4/15/2010,Nicorette

I also have about 4 hernias and I know it is because the nicorette ate up my stomach lining.,F,57,10  years,1/10/2010Email,Nicorette

458, 1, Smoking Cessation,Nicorette 4mg Mint Lozenges cause extreme burning in throat and tongue_ awful taste.,My husband and I tried the nicorette 4mg lozenges and the cinnamon gum. We are both enjoying the gum but plan to wean off it gradually over the next two weeks. The Lozenges are awful. They taste bitter and make your tongue feel thick_ filmy and numb. After thirty seconds of use they cause very harsh burning of the tongue and throat. We both tried them with the same results_ what a waste of money! If you need anything_ stick to the gum but only for a month_ then wean off it promptly. Never chew_ just bite and pocket it in your cheek_ biting once every two minutes. Discard after 30 minutes. This should help avoid problems with the teeth and jaw.,F,28,3  weeks,1/2/2010,Nicorette
459, 1, I was foolish,Bone loss in the area where I used to store the nicorette in my mouth,PLEASE READ AND LEARN: I just quit nicorette after 22 years_ yes_ 22 years!!!  I never noticed any side effects from chewing it... I loved it.  A few months ago_ I noticed a lump on my gum (in the area that I used to store the nicorette).  I went to a dentist_ periodontist_ endodontist and oral surgeon. I ended up having multiple bone grafts because there was no bone left in that area.  If the latest graft is not successful_ I will need to have my healthy tooth removed and get an implant.  I believe these problems are a result of the $300+/month habit I had for so long.  I hope my experience helps someone that wants to break this horribly addicting drug!  I also hope Nicorette is discontinued...

My plan was to wean myself off the nicorrette pretty soon and I will definately make sure that I do now_ although_ with the excrutiating pain in my mouth (I can hardly eat or talk my tongue hurts so badly)I haven't even really wanted to chew a piece of the gum.

First_ the product can help initially with quitting smoking_ however_ Second_ the product is extremely addictive.  In my fourth month of cessation I was actually down to 1 mg a day-I thought i was just around the corner from success.  Then stress can into my life and I started to gradually increase my intake_ first 1-10 a day and then i thought I would at least drop from 4mg to 2mg but only to end up doubling my intake to 20 per day.  I am now up to 30-40 a day. This product is addictive!!!! Quit now_ do not wait until we discover that this has long term effects that rival smoking itself.  There should be more warning with the sale.  And not one to believe in conspiracy or markteting ploys by marketer_ you have to wonder!!!  And price it out people_ they are now getting almost as expensive as cigarettes!,F,52,2  months,12/15/2009,Nicorette

468, 1, originally to quit smoking,At the beginning_ none.  But over time_ started to get more and more addicted and need higher and higher doses (up to 20 4mg per day.) Urine smelled awful. Have had abnormal liver function test results (ALT levels).  Lost interest in things that once gave me pleasure - Nicorette became the most important thing.,Its effects remind me of the ring's effects on Gollum in Lord of the Rings: ' my precioussss...'.  It insidiously hooks you and eats away at you from the inside.  I used it to give me energy and see me through stressful times but it ended up being the most important thing in my life.

I sold my house and moved_ the stress got to me_ so I'm up to 7-10 pieces per day.  I've cut back to 7 pieces_ with regular gum in between.  Will gradually get back to 4 pieces per day_ with the hope of giving it up all together.  I don't want these horendous mouth sores any longer.  AND_ my tongue looks like leather. I'm very concerned about mouth cancer using the nicotine gum.  I quite smoking 12 years ago and started using Bandits. I quite the Bandits in June '09 and started using the Nico gum.

I used the gum for 5 weeks_ about 140 pieces_ and while it didn't erase the cravings_ it eased them down from the shaking_ nail-biting_ laying awake all night and going totally insane cravings to something more manageable.  And quitting the gum still sucked_ but a hell of a lot easier than quitting the Griz.  I am now 5 monthes tabacco free_ and almost 4 monthes nicotine free_ and 110 dollars richer!Word for the wise; unlike some people who bitch about being addicted to this product_ I didn't abuse it by chewing piece after piece for monthes on end.  I only chewed a piece when I REALLY needed it!!  Otherwise_ I chewed a piece of Big Red.  Do the same_ and you'll be fine!Good luck if you give it a shot!,M,25,5  weeks,11/7/2009,Nicorette

488, 5, quit smoking,In addition to smoking cessation_ Nicotine gum has helped me maintain healthy body weight.,"I weighed 200 pounds when I quit smoking 8 years ago. I quit smoking through ""combo-therapy."" I joined a smoking cessation group_ I started an exercise program_ I started taking Ziban_ and I began chewing nicotine gum. The self help group ended after a few months. Ziban caused strange dreams_ so I gave that up_ too. But the exercise and the nicotine gum remained for the next 6 years. Within months_ my wight declined to 160 pounds_ which I maintained for the next 6 years. In December 2006_ I gave up the nicotine gum but maintained the diet and exercise program. I assumed that the diet and exercise program was entirely responsible for maintaining low body weight. Still_ within a year my weight shot back up to 200 pounds_ so I started the nicotine gum again. Within a month my wight declined by 25 pounds_ and I am now confident that I will reach my normal weight in due course. For me_ nicotine gum seems to be an indispensable elixir of good health. I buy nicotine gum in bulk on line_ and the cost is far less than cigarettes. I buy the cheapest brand I can find. They all work equally well.",M,47,7  years,10/13/2009Email,Nicorette

491, 1, Stop smoking/chewing tobacco,Used gum to stop chewing tobacco that I previously used to stop smoking.  Gum was great.  No need to spit as w/ chewing tobacco.  Could even chew gum at work.  Now I could feed the nicotine habit during all waking hrs of the day!  I got to the point I preferred gum to chewing tobacco or smoking.  Initially felt better on gum than chew... Started using gum almost non-stop 5 years ago.  Consumed 10+ pieces 4mg per day_ some days up to 20.  Started to experience heavy palipations (heart pounding) at night and lack of cardio.  Shortness of breath when climbing stairs and occaisional chest pain/fullness.  Quit cold turkey 2 months ago.  Used Stride spearmint gum 1st couple days.  Very cranky at first.  Used will power and refused to relapse after first couple days.  Since quitting have had some more chest fullness and esophogus pain/discomfort.  Visited DR and ER due to chest pain/dizzyness.,Completed stress echo test w/ no problems found. I guarantee I would not have been able to make 14 minutes on treadmill prior to stopping gum.  Was winded just climbing stairs before quitting.  Will be going in for another visit.  Maybe scope for acid reflux?  I think prolonged usage of gum has contributed.  Dr's don't seem interested in talking about nicorette_ think enough time has passed since quitting that it's not a factor.  I think so much nicotine for so long had impact on health_ physical and mental.QUIT TODAY!  It is not as hard as you think.  Make it through those first couple days and it gets easier.  You will be grumpy for a while but it is worth it!I will post again after additional DR visits to let you know if anything is found.,M,42,10  years,10/6/2009,Nicorette

Extreme hair loss_ wearing down of porcelain crowned teeth_ general mailaise and not feeling well.,This stuff should carry the same warning as cigarettes have to.  It is a nicotine product that is even more addicting than cigarettes_ and can make a person much sicker than cigarettes ever could.

I have been loosing more hair than I think normal for many years.  But aside from the hair loss (which I did not connect to nicotine until I found this Board)_ cankers (hard to get rid of when chewing gum)_ I thought all was ok.  Now I just got back mildly abnormal liver function tests (ALT in particular)_ an ultrasound that showed an echogenic liver and an elevated ferritin test (which has something to do with iron stores).  And strangely_ I notice that elevated ferritin is associated with hair loss.  I don't know what is wrong with my liver yet.

Please be aware that the first 6 months I had no problems but it seems if you exceed the recommended usage and continue to ingest the chemicals in the gum you are at risk of getting some side effect. I now chew Gurana gum from the health store and my acne_ dandruff and mysterious red scaly spots have slowly gone. (My personal conclusion) after researching the ingredients in all the UK smokers gums...there are chemicals contained in all the gums that if ingested for longer than the stated period of time adversley alter the chemical balance in the human body.

I've always chewed the unflavored gum.  Some of these people who are posting seem to be suffering from anxiety and blame everything-real and imagined-on the gum.

The Answer we have all given is an unequivocable:  ""NO"".  What THE GUM did accomplish was the expensive replacement of one addiction (nicotine from smoking) with the same addiction (Nicotine in the Gum).  And the FDA approved this scam.  The tiny warning print on the pamphlet inside the packaging is not acceptable - I got out a magnifying glass and read the warning after I was well past the 3 months of taking Nicorette and I read it because my normal good health was becoming compromised...this product MUST go back to being prescribed by your Doctor.  It is far too dangerous when taken for more than a few months and likely more dangerous than cigarettes if the FDA would bother to look into the known side effects.  When you visit your Dr. and have tests taken to try to figure out what is causing rapid onset of hair breakage/loss_ severe gastritis_ dental issues_ etc._ NOTHING SHOWS UP IN THE TESTS and blood work.  The only item that changed in my life was taking the NICORETTE and NOT SMOKING CIGARETTES_ so I know it's the Nicorette poison upsetting many areas of the body.  Certainly doesn't make sense to ingest nicotine in gum form in an attempt to cure an addiction to nicotine in cigarette form.   Our issues are too similar and consistent with Nicorette use.

Grandpa was bald_ my brother is bald.. I'm 40 years old. Safe to say it's probably not the gum making me bald.Now my receding gum-line and loss of tooth enamel is another story.

If you abuse anything you are going to have negative side effects. Get a grip. You can't chew 60mg of nicotine a day and think you will be ok. You shouldn't even use the stuff after a year. You shouldn't get TMJ if you are using it as directed. Read the box for christ sake. You shouldn't chew more than five pieces of this stuff a day. The suggested 9 pieces is more than I would recommend. If you want to quit slowly cut down the amound you are using day by day_ week by week_ or whatever. Yes_ if you chew this stuff you are liable to get mouth cancer after a long period of time. No one should be on 4mg of this stuff for a long period of time. You are just asking for it.

Why did I wait so long? I think we have been made so ashamed of smoking_ we will put up with anything to stop. Something is wrong with that thinking.

I would rather have this gum than smoke a cigarette.  I'm so addicted to this gum that I think it will be harder to quit than cigarettes. I was a closet smoker so never smoked freely all day long like I do with this stupid gum.  I have it in my mouth all day long. I plan on quitting tomorrow! This will be my second try.  I found this website doing a search on the topic and now wonder if my recent hair loss issue is possibly related to my long term nicorette use?  This should be enough to motivate me to quit (vanity can be a powerful reason).  There is no way this gum is totally benign...it's a chemical that's being ingested into our bodies.  It's evil (but I am grateful it got me off of smoking).,F,48,20  years,5/5/2009Email,Nicorette

Like everyone else on this message board I have an addiction to nicotine. I feel I was born with this addiction but I wont go into that topic here. So_ the three choices we have are: smoke cigarettes ingest tar etc and get cancer_ chew nicotine gum and suffer side effects_ or quit nicotine altogether.

This last time I think I am succeeding because both my kids are away at college so I could actually feel terrible and do nothing and no one bothered me! I also knew just how bad it was going to be because I have quit before but never for more than 5 days so I was ready this time to allow all feelings of depression_ anger_ sadness_ and general feelings of irritability.(and I have a great husband) I will note that my weight loss has stalled since the day I quit and I haven't done anything different so hoping that will fix itself soon.

I stuck with it_ mostly because of encouragement from other sources_ doctors_ Internet_ etc. Unfortunately_ for me_ even with minimal use the effects were quite strong and prolonged well after discontinuing use.--It took three months of solid effort after discontinuing use of NRT to return my health status to pre NRT use_ including dropping the excess weight gain. Hair did not recover_ I suspect it won't. --After that I tried quitting again_ AND since my only option NOW was essentially cold turkey or quickly weaning of_ I stuck it out and am now smoke free for 4 months. The biggest trick with quitting smoking_ is not a trick at all. It's the same trick_ people use for whenever they are doing something. If your not happy about doing something you will simply not do it. When quitting smoking_ it is essential to do things/activities that will boost your dopamine thru normal mechanisms for the first little while. --Nobody_ I know that tried quitting smoking was successful with NRT.

555, 5, to stop smoking,In one year of use overall minimal side effects. Some occasional minor jaw pain_ heartburn or hiccups.

557, 4, To help stop smoking,I have an entry below_ but  wanted to add that I had to stop the gum because I was getting swollen glands & sinusitus & ear pain so awfully bad. Every day I felt like I still had a cold/flu. I tried a test and stopped the gum and the pressure in my ears was gone & what a relief_ my swollen glands went down-they were so sore I felt like I had the mumps and the swelling in my sinuses went down so I didn't also have a headache.  I think it is like TMJ and oh boy I have had a time with it & all the advil and sinus meds I have been taking when I realized what was really going on.  I also got cankers on both sides of my very sore sensitive tongue. Extreme dry mouth in the morning.  So many days have been wasted due to the gum and me feeling unwell & if I had known why long ago I could have had a lot of good days that I missed.,"I am still addicted to nicorette and probably will be for ever_ but I will never smoke again-can't even stand the smell.  So since the gum has been my friend and really helped me out I now realize if I want to feel good I need to stop ""chewing"" the gum.  So I am still taking Nicorrete but in lozange form_ I bought the 1mg Thrive and suck on that and it helps with my cravings without the side effects.  Maybe try it_ can you imagine how many times in a day over a week & a month into years we chew-chew-chew? The old jaws are going constanly and eventually even jaws give out.  What an awful thing nicotine is I wish I was never raised in a home of smokers and then I became one & then my son became one. Nicotine is so powerful it's hard to believe.

560, 3, Originally to stop smoking,None after about a week of use,I used this to quit smoking 10 years ago and am still addicted to the gum.  In those 10 years_  I have chewed it while being a smoker_  chewed it while taking Chantix_  and now_  thank heavens_  I'm only chewing the gum.  I think it might be giving me headaches_  but only when i use too much.  I finally read the literature last night_  and realized that i overdose almost daily.  So i'm rationing it now_ with the goal of tapering off to a quit.  But bottom line is_ i'm addicted to it.  I get panicky when i'm out_  and will take a break during the work day to run to the drug store to get more.   I agree with another poster that the consistency is important_  and most regular gums aren't going to work for me.

574, 5, ,ok I quit 5 years ago this month. Nicotine is addictive because when you started smoking it signals to you body to produce serotonin. When you stop getting nicotine you notice the complete lack of this happy hormone. The good news is that for every day you do not give your body nicotine_ it starts to produce and release serotonin again on it's own. It will never produce this hormone on it's own if you keep feeding your body nicotine. The gum works but merely continues the addiction to nicotine. Once you stop all forms of nicotine_ your body will crave nicotine less and less as it starts regulating it own dosing of serotonin. My experience with the gum was stomach problems_ which led to poor digestion (especially of protiens & fats). It also caused severe bad breathe. It has taken most of last 3.5 years of no gum to restore my stomach. Use it to quit but realize you need to go through some withdrawl when you first give the gum up.

Went from sleeping and craving sweets the 1st month to tired_ depressed and irritable.,I would like to know if others are experiencing bad side affects from the patch. A search on Nicoderm only has 3 reviews.  I have not only been tired_ depressed and irritable_ I am also experiencing the aching in my arms and legs like some of you and pimples. Prior to quitting and using the patch I was very happy and active. I haven't smoked since 10/1/08 which is about the only good thing. I have not had the hairloss. I used the gum a bit at first but it upset my stomach_ gave me bloating and gas - glad I couldn't handle it.,F,50,85  days,12/25/2008,Nicorette

Extremely addicted at first (1 piece every 20 minutes) and this adversely affected my pre-existing TMJ issue.  My stomach pains from chewing over the recommended dosage is unbelievable  thought I had an ulcer.   I bought a mega pack of Eclipse from CVS to chew in between Nicorette.  Down to 5 pieces a day but the gastro intestinal issues painfully persist.  Hope the symptoms fade after I quit using the gum  only 4 weeks left.  Side effects are much less mild than the anaphylatic shock I suffered from Chantix - can't complain.,,F,34,8  weeks,12/22/2008,Nicorette
594, 1, To stop smoking,Severe hair loss,Ive been addicted to Nicorette Microtabs for nearly 3 years since I gave up smoking.  I first discovered the gum about 7 years ago_ when I found it was a great cigarette substitute during office hours and on long flights.  But I didnt like the constant jaw ache and noise from chewing and I had dodgy gums anyway.  Then I discovered the Microtabs which you put under your tongue.   Theyre very discreet and you get your nicotine fix with none of the harmful smoke.  I stopped the cigs altogether and thought the Microtabs were fantastic.  I knew Id become addicted but couldnt find any evidence that long-term nicotine use was harmful.  So I carried on_ trying to cut down but constantly yo-yoing in my consumption.  At times Ive managed to get it down to about 4 tabs a day (they are 2mg each) but when I start getting stressed_ I find Im taking over 20 a day.  I still thought there was nothing too harmful about the nicotine but 3 months ago my hai,F,52,7  years,12/18/2008Email,Nicorette
595, 1, stop smoking,hair thinning. major hair loss.,first tried the gum 2years ago to stop smoking but when I stopped the gum and started smoking again I became a bigger smoker. After some time of abusive smoking I used the gum again and was able not to smoke for some time.  6 months ago I started to loose ALOT of hair and was wondering why.  I didnt know if cigarettes or the gum was causing this.  I supposed it was cigarettes so I stayed on the gum.  Reading this confort me to think that my hair loss may be linked to the gum and I think it's time to stop it.  I can count loosing more than a 100hairs a day_ long hairs and new short hairs and also new hair doesnt seem to grow back and if it does they are very thin.  My scalp is very greasy and the smell 8h after washing is very bad.  People always told me I had so much hair I would never go bald_ but now I'm not balding as in male pattern baldness; I'm just shedding alot of hair everywhere_ at 27!  I'm quitting this medicine right now and hope to reverse this situation..,M,27,2  years,12/18/2008,Nicorette

(returns to normal after not chewing gum for 24 hours.) Possible hair loss. Possible extreme immune system suppression. Possible chronic digestive problems. Cancre like sores in mouth from time to time.,This product is definitely unsafe and MORE addictive than cigarettes. It is also so expensive that it could eat up the entirety of your retirement fund! It even tastes toxic. I was an extremely healthy distance swimmer when I quit smoking. Now I am chronically ill with some petty malady_ cold_ flu_ sore throat_ what ever is going around. Prior to starting the nicotine gum I had not heen ill with ANYTHING for over 10 years even though I was smoking heavily. I do manage to cut down from time to time by meditating on how ill it is making me_ how toxic it tastes_ and how much it raises the settings on the heart monitor I use for swimming.I might lock myself into my home with all the food and water I will need for two weeks_ leave car_ cash cards and credit cards with someone I trust_ and quit cold turkey.

I stopped chewing the Nicorette gum today because yesterday my gums started hurting really bad and swelling.  I've also been chewing so much that my jaw and mouth ache_ plus I have some raw spots on the inside of my cheek where I keep nipping the tissue in a chewing frenzy.

My hairdresser found a bald spot 2 weeks ago - I began going to my dermatologist 4 months ago with the same complaints - Chemical like burns on my neck and jawbone area of face_ red like pimples or bumps - My neck looks like its made of ""crate paper"" or that of someone who is very old - My ""monthly cycles"" have been ""off"" - After various topical creams for my neck and face and a series of pills it's all the same - A shot of cortozone in my scalp where the bald spot is and it continues to fall out - I have changed my skin regimne_ diet - I recently convinced myself that I was a neurtoic_ anxiety ridden_ ""stress case_"" causing MY hair to fall out - I was going into early menopause and my teeth were turning yellow because 40 is old.

641, 4, To Stop smoking,Gas_ egg smelling_ foul smelling_ lingering_ uncontrollable_ embarrassing gas_ flatulence_ farting.,Over all it's a great product.  Very expensive at nearly fifty dollars a box (lasts about a week) Even more expensive than smoking.  Yikes_ you would think the price would be LOWER_ nothing like no price incentive to quit.  Needless to say it's the main reason I am trying to not use the product at all.  I smoked for over 20 years and I was a 2 pack a day lady.  My lungs feel fine my house doesn't smell and neither do my close.  EXCEPT WHEN I AM FARTING.  Personally I think it's because I am using it longer than recommended.  Nothing I have read says it's suppose to be used over a year and like many I have been using it as a crutch also.  Vanity will in the end make me quit entirely.  I wish this product did not have this side affect;  I could of given it a 5.,M,43,365  days,2/16/2008,Nicorette
642, 4, Smoking!!!,Dizziness. Red or dry skin. Mouth sores_ Loose teeth. Jaw pain.  General stress onhealth_ like drinking tons of coffee everyday. Speaking of coffee_  one thing I did notice_ is that when I do NOT chew_ I drink tons of coffee.  When I chew_  I drink almost no coffee.  In the morning_ if I have a choice_ its the gum hands down.,Better then smoking.  It took a box or two before I started liking it more then smoking_ but one there_ the addiction advantages are obvious. A cig rush last for a few minutes. The gum last for 15-30 minutes.  Plus since it does not hurt your lungs_ smell_ tie up your hands_ and so on.  So you can keep popping them inone after another_  flooding your brain with huge amount of nicotine_ minute after minute_ hour after hour. day after day.   Anytime_ anywhere. No stop smoking signs etc to slow you down.  Less harshness_  means you can take in tons more nicotine.  Well until your teeth_ jaw_ or wallet give out anyway!!!  My last bout_  I chewed for two weeks straight_  morning to night.  For others_  as I have read here_ it can last for years.  Think about buying some regular gum at the store_ and then spitting it out 5 - 10 years later.  That is what everyone here is talking about. Tons safer then smoking_ more addictive due to the logistics!!!! Still damaging over the long term.,M,48,3  months,2/10/2008,Nicorette
643, 4, stop smoking,Nicorette was too expensive for me. So I bought Nicotrol from ebay. nicotrol is almost half price. but_ it's made by pfyzer. Like others_ I found this gum is quite addictive even if I have had it for only 5 weeks. Initially took 5 pieces of 2mg every day. Now I am taking 4_ sometimes 3. My plan is quitting this gum after 3 more weeks.,It's my plan (2mg nicotrol gum). 1. 5 pieces for 3 weeks.2. 4 pieces for 1 week3. 3 pieces for 2 weeks - sometimes using ordinary gum. Even if I haven't smoked for 5 weeks_ I still think of myself as a smoker. I know quitting smoking is really difficult. But_ I will this time. In that regard_ this addictive gum has been alright.,M,36,5  weeks,2/9/2008Email,Nicorette
644, 5, To keep quitting.,Burps only with 2mg. 4mg taken a year previously was a nightmare.,I started 2mg gum after quitting smoking for over a week. I found that stress caused me to crave and slip so I got the gum. It's helped. I went from 2 packs a day to nothing then to 2 pieces of 2 mg gum a day for about a week. Once the 40 pieces are gone from the pack then I will be done with smoking. A year earlier I tried to quit using the 4mg and it was like a nightmare. LET ME TELL YOU IT IS MUCH EASIER TO QUIT SMOKING COLD TURKEY.,F,29,7  days,2/6/2008,Nicorette
645, 5, To keep from starting back smoking,hicups once in a while_ heart palpitations when I chew too much in a day_ increased blood pressure.,I am addicted to it. I am currently trying to quit because I do not think it is good for me.,F,61,5  years,2/1/2008,Nicorette
646, 4, To quit chewing tobacco,Addiction to nicorette.  I was chewing 20-30 pieces of 4mg gum per day for 4 years.  Blood pressure increased over this time.  Traded nicorette addiction for 10 lbs. and Wrigley's Extra addiction.  Met my goal of giving up nicotine_ just took a bit longer and thousands of dollars more than i'd have liked.,,M,,4  years,1/26/2008,Nicorette
647, 3, Smoker,Mouth sores_ irregular heartbeat_ bad breath although not as bad as when I was a smoker and upset stomach. I have developed other problems_ although no way of knowing if it is from Nicorette.,I have to say I traded one problem for another. I chew 4 mg 24/7 and can go through 170 pieces in less than 6 days. I have been chewing the nicorette now for 12 years. If I run out for a short time my mood becomes irrational. It is costing me more money than I have. I have chosen Nicorette over food many times. All I can say is that I did quite smoking with Nicorette and even with it_ the first year of quitting smoking was really hard. I think I am healthier on Nicorette_ but not as healthy as I should be. IF you chew it do not let you self get out of control. Follow the instructions and than just quite it. I now need a support group to quite nicorette. I wish I could find such a thing. I now know getting off of Nicorette will be as hard as quitting smoking for me.,F,36,12  years,1/25/2008,Nicorette

650, 3, quit smoking,White spots on sides of tongue_ low grade chronic sore throat_ tightness swallowing. Contributed to a tooth loosening that needed extraction. Hiccups when ODing.,I am at this forum because I obviously went searching to see if others were hooked like me. I think I may be chewing my tongue in my sleep (dreaming of nicorette?). Throat now bothering me for awhile - Doc sees nothing there_ prescribed Protonix ($1/pill). Way past time to quit - am going to try cutting up squares and mix with regular gum.,M,48,4  years,1/15/2008,Nicorette
651, 4, Stop smoking,(Actually_ I chew another brand with mannitol in it - it's sweeter than Nicorette.) Always have a mouth ulcer happening_ which I'm getting sick of. Tend to chew the gum rather than rest it in my cheek.,When I first gave up smoking_ I chewed whole 4mg gums. After about 3-4 months I started pinching the 4mg gums in half_ which I didn't notice much. Then_ after about another 3 months_ I started buying the 2mg gums and pinching them in half. Still chewing half-2mg gums now - about 6 whole 2mg gums a day (12 half-gum doses). I'd like to stop chewing now though - have given up smoking for nearly a year. If_ after stopping gum_ I felt myself at risk of smoking again_ I'd much more happily go back to chewing than smoking. Don't want to smoke ever again!!,M,41,11  months,1/10/2008,Nicorette

Pounding Heart.These are only the very visible side effects.Inner damage of long term use???,Nicorette is a seriously addictive drug_ highly habit forming. Definitely switching one addiction for another if usage is continued past the recommended time frame. Nicotine is poison. It's encouraging to know some have successfully kicked the chewing habit. I intend to quit cold turkey...And with God's help_ I hope to succeed.,F,34,3  years,1/4/2008,Nicorette
654, 2, Stop chewing Copenhagen,Mild hair loss_ high blood pressure_ abnormal heart beat_ moodiness.,I chewed Copenhagen for 18 yrs.  My wife and I agreed that I should quit so I tried Nicorette gum.  After several attempts_ the Nicorette helped me kick Cope.  Unfortunately_ 4 yrs later I was still chewing the gum.  I tossed out the gum three days ago. After some research and a Doctors visit_ I suspect the gum is the cause of high blood pressure_ hair loss_ and a abnormal heart beat.  Prior to the gum_ I was a model of physical fitness and heart health.  I supose my age and lifestyle may contribute to the side effects/symptoms_ but I am absolutely convinced the Nicorette definately caused or contributed to my issues.  I pray that the gum was a good choice over Cope.  Time will tell.  For those considering the gum...don't chew it.  Try something else.  I believe the side effects are real and dangerous in the long term.,M,35,4  years,12/30/2007,Nicorette
655, 1, To Quit Smoking,"Like many of you I traded one evil for another. I believe this gum caused my Gastritis - a very painful and hard to rid of stomach disorder that is many times worse than any addiction. I couldn't eat solid food for months. This forced me to quit the gum cold turkey with a very intense ""acid trip"" of a withdrawal followed by several visits to the ER and thousands of dollars worth of medical bills.  The withdrawal process lasted about 1 1/2 months!!!! HORRIBLE CANNOT BEGIN TO DESCRIBE IT! I have other problems as well but I don't want to scare anyone. I would NOT recommend the gum because of this possible issue with Gastritis and god knows what other chemicals are in that stuff.",In my opinion this gum should be prescription only and require constant doctor supervision.,M,32,5  years,12/19/2007,Nicorette

Much more healthier than smoking.,I have been using fo 6 weeks. No resious complaints.  Eating and drinking close to chewing can make you sick_ but i usually drink a water or diet coke when I chew the gum_ but i make sure i swallow the gum flavoring before i drink. I inhaled black and milds for 6 years everyday.  I used the 2mg the first time i tried to qui and 4 mg the second time_ but I wanted to quit more seriouly the second time.  I am going to look for less expensive alternative.,M,23,6  weeks,12/10/2007,Nicorette
657, 5, to stop smoking,12 days with no cigarettes!   Experiencing body aches (joints/muscles) at various times in arms_ legs_ knees.. Strange,I love it too!  Better than smoking and I knew that because I would chew during the day at work and smoke in the morning and at night.  Knew that if I wanted to stop smoking it would be with the gum and finally did it! However_ the body aches are worrying me and I'm about to put the gum down and try something else.  I can TRULY see where I could be addicted to the gum for 5-10 years.,F,43,12  days,12/5/2007,Nicorette

Nicorette really helped me quit Copenhagenbut now Im obviously addicted to the gumThe gum is obviously better than Copenhagen for many reasons..however..I can tell you that my blood pressure has risen_ and I have a low white blood cell count because of the gum.  I get sick all the time due to this.  If I over chew it Ill get a sore throat and eventually a sinus infection.  My doctor always asked me ..do you smoke?  I tell him nohe doesnt  know I use any tobacco products.  He says  you get bronchitis s a lot.  Bottom line the gum is no good for youIt will have long term effects.

Trouble breathing (like cant get oxygen)_ feels like a heart attack?  Weight gain.,Sounds like bad side effects_ but my lungs feel so much better_ it is worth it.  I chew the cinnamon gum.  I have read that the sucralose can cause your stomach to ferment_ so after this pack_ I am quitting (I hope).  Am planning to replace the gum with Trident whitening cinnamon_ since it tastes the same_ to wean myself off.  This gum also has sucralose_ so may not work for me-- cuz the 9 months pregnant look is not making me happy!Anyone else have this problem???????,F,33,7  weeks,11/25/2007,Nicorette

661, 1, To quit smoking for good,At first_ it worked great. I was a pack a day smoker but the only problem is that I never came off of the 4mg gum. My doc said it was fine to continuing chewing because it was less damaging than smoking. Only problem is that just about on the 5 year mark of chewing about 10 pcs a day. I now have severe TMJ_ which has causing quite the bout with anxiety. I now have switched to the 2mg losenges (to reduce the jaw damage) while I try and quit nicotine replacement for ever. I recommend that people go ahead and use the gum_ but STOP after the 12 weeks that the box states!,Be careful. TMJ sucks.,M,36,5  years,11/22/2007,Nicorette

664, 4, Stop Smokeless Tobacco Use,Chew 20-25 pieces of 2 mg/day. Side effects include dry mouth_ brief palpitations especially after coffee. Muscle twitches in legs. Difficulty sleeping sometimes if I chew right before bed. Sometimes get mouth sores or irritated throat.,Used Smokeless Tobacco for 9 years and became extremely addicted. Quit in spring of '02 for 2.5 years using Nicorette then got back on chew for a couple years and quit again in July of 06 with Nicorette and not chewed since. Nicorette has certainly helped but I am definitely addicted to it now. Chew gum constantly and noticing an irritated throat off and on lately. Are there any statistics that tie Nicorrette to throat or mouth cancer or is it just the constant chewing? Be interested if anyone else has experienced irritated throat.,M,37,5  years,10/18/2007,Nicorette
665, 1, To shop smoking,I came across this page in search of wondering if nicorette has something to do with my recent hair thinning.  I don't know why it would randomly start happening at age 28.  There seems to be thining in different areas_ almost patchy thinning.  I noticed others complaining and wondering about the same thing. I am trying to figure out if this is true.  I am starting to belive it is after reading the other comments. I notice when i run out of nicorette that my hair seems not to shed as much. even if i am smoking.  Does the numb feeling i get  on the top of my head when taking nicorette have something to do with the hair loss? Is anyone else having these problems? I am going to do an experiment and stop taking the nicorette again and see what happens.. i'll make another post soon..

676, 3, smoking cessation,Hair Loss,After considering all other potential causes of hair loss (e.g._ thyroid function_ nutritional status_ genetic predisposition_ hormonal changes)_ it occurred to me that the only thing different that coincided with my hair loss was the chewing of nicorette gum (about a week after beginning Nicorette).   I_ too_ am shocked that this was not reported in Nicorette clinical trials with a subsequent side-effect mention on the label. I have had an approximate 55-60% loss of hair. I have stopped the nicorette and hope that my hair loss is not permanent.  I am satisfied with the crutch nicorette provided while stopping smoking but believe I traded one addiction for another (although less pulmonary toxic than smoking!) I think the drug company should investigate the reason why there is associated hair loss and determine if it is indeed nicotine or some other ingredient.  I chewed only about 5 pieces of 2mg / day and suffered this side effect.  Therefore_ I do not think it is due to nicotine_ per,F,51,4  months,8/1/2007,Nicorette

I haven't seen any other complaints like this_ but it can't just be me. Can it? Also stomach problems_ TMJ_ headaches from chewing_ and hair thinning.,It's also close to impossible to quit chewing this stuff.

However my lungs are better now I haven't touched a cigarette for 2 years and 23 days. I believe nicotine replacement is fantastic to help give up the cigs_ but the gum is exceptionally addictive and I chew it non-stop on my days off work. having said that I am a 43 year old woman and people always estimate my age at 34 and under so I think another benefit of chewing gum all day is the wonderful muscle workout it gives your face!! I do however get very very occasional palpitations that pass quickly when I overdo the gum and the occasional gastric discomfort_ but I can breathe and I don't cough and I don't stink of smelly cigs and I am alive still.,F,43,6  years,1/23/2007,Nicorette

These discomforts disappeared within 48 hrs from stopping taking nicorette.","I never smoked; tried in my youth_ but never liked it.  I guess food and overeating is my addiction_ and since this is an oral behavior_ I thought that nicorette could be a good ""treatment"".  Nicorette definitely took care of overeating and the cravings for food.  Funny though_ with time_ I have learned that it works by taking the food cravings away_ so I would actually choose not to chew it in order to binge. I guess for me_ overeating does  something for me that is better than what nicorette feels like.  After suffering from fatigue and constant bloating for about 2-3 months_ I just guit taking nicorette and have not missed it at all.  I guess I just can't get addicted to nicotine.  Within 48 hours_ my fatigue and nausea/bloating disappeared.

Finally_ I decided that the ills of chewing could never be as fatal as smoking. My approach was that the gum would provide me with a safer delivery system.  I now chew gum.  All the time.  I do not smoke. Not for over 10 years.  I haven't had the chronic bronchitis that I had year over year_ and that in and of itself is enough to chew.  I cut the costs at Justgum.com (Nicotrol rebranded nicorette gum).  Forgive me if I sound like an ad_ but cost is a real factor for those of us who need the gum.

For everyone here_ you should not chew over 10 a day. Personally_ I think 5 a day is enough. You need to see each piece of gum as a cigarette. If you are chewing 15-30 of them a day_ then it is similar as smoking 15 to 30 cigarettes a day. I had been smoking cigarettes for over 4 years and I was a chain smoker. If you really control yourself_ this stuff will work. Now I am trying to chew 3 pieces a day and the rest of the time_ I chew on ordinary gums.,M,30,1.5  years,7/12/2006,Nicorette
