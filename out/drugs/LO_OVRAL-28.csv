4, 1, ovarian cyst control,Extreme anxiety_ depression_ extreme mood swings_ low libedo.,After i started taking this i noticed that i started getting depressed. The depression turned into having mild anxiety attacks around the placebo week. I thought i would give it a few months. The anxiety lessoned but the mood swswings are horrific. I have stopped taking them because i feel it has changed my attitude and i do not like the person i have become. I am not myself on these pills. Id much rather deal with the pain from a cyst bursting than this emotional roller coaster.,F,29,8  months,4/28/2015,Lo/ovral-28

11, 5, birth control_ heavy periods_ acne,As long as I take the brand version of this pill (not the generic) I have no side effects after the first month or two.  First two months I had some problems with mood swings but nothing else.  I find that my sex drive is affected negatively from the generic version but I don't seem to have as much of a problem with the brand version. I also get some other undesirable side effects from the generic - mood problems especially. I've taken two different kinds of generic pills for this drug and while one was better than the other_ I still don't do as well on them.,This has been the best pill for me. I took it for about 3 years but then tried some others due to sex drive issues.  I've tried Ovcon-35_ Estrostep_ OTC lo_ and Yaz. I liked OTC lo A LOT and it was great for my sex drive_ but it took my acne from mild to severe and I'm still trying to recover. I did not do well on any of the other pills. I went back to Lo/Ovral 3 months ago.  It is a bit expensive for me because I will only take the brand name_ but it's worth it.,F,26,3.5  years,8/8/2007,Lo/ovral-28
