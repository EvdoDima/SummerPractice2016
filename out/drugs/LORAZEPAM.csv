2, 1, anxiety take as needed,I took a .025 half a .05 to make sure I was not allergic to it. I asked the phyco Dr. For a diazepam as I had taken 1 for dentist and one at ER and felt normal. She said no I have to take this. I tried half and was anxious and fresked out to tske it. I took it and with in 3 minutes it hit me. I felt head high and body pains intensified. Felt like it was harder to breath for 27 minutes I felt the worse intense Anxiety. It amplified my anxiety.  After 30 minutes I felt better but my legs were tired. So after 2 hours I took the other half and was not as bad but still had my anxiety. So On Friday June 24 2016 I was extremely anxious I thought ok this is the real run threw I knew I would not die from it so I took. 1/4 th of the .05 and with in 3 minutes i felt the head weired body harder tight chest amplified anxiety the worst. Then haveing to put my daugter back to bed and her being fussy was amplified my nerves were threw the roof. It was about 30 minutes before I felt ok so I decided to take the other 1/4 of the .05 and the same symtoms all over again. I am not making it up it is not in my head. I hate this stuff. All I wanted was take as needed Diazapam(valium) now The Dr. Will give my another different one to try next. The reason I have to take as needed is I have stroke type migraimnes and Tacacrdia for my heart so I can not really take anything.,I was prescribed 5 take as needed so I will try again and I am documenting for the Doctor my symptoms. I have researched that lorazepam increases the glutemate in the brain. Well I get migraines and read Glutemate from msg form and natural as well as potassium ion can cause the cortex depression the makes the visual disturbance of the migraine. But to say i have npt been triggered to have a migraine. I really do hate this stuff.,F,35,2  days.025 half,6/25/2016Email,Lorazepam

17, 1, Loss my child Still born full term,I was about to deliver my baby and her heart stop beating inside of me. They administered ATIVAN on top of narcotics to me to keep me numb. I never asked for them to treat me with ATIVAN and didn't even know what is was until I was released home  from the hospital and had been on the prescription for 30 days. I tried to cold turkey the ATIVAN and what did I do that for I had had my first panic attack. I was at work and it felt as if death was coming upon me and I couldn't stop it. I was pacing the floor and told people to please call 911 I was dying. The ambulance came and said I was having a panic attack. I was crying and didn't understand a damn thing at that point. They administered at the ER this damn ATIVAN again and it dawned on me to start my investigation on this actual drug and to start being mindful at the aftermath effects it had on me. ATIVAN is a quick fix when you are in a state of uncontrolled anxiety or a panic attack but beware because it amplifies your condition when you try to get off of it. I had weened myself off of it and gone through and still going through the motions of being off ATIVAN. I had major withdrawal symptoms like head aches_ muscle spasms_ dizziness_ feeling of doom randomly_ disoriented at times_ unable to concentrate at times_ nervousness_ upset stomach_ chest pains_ and the ultimate heart palpitations unbearably. I have been off for 5 months and still don't feel all the way like my old self. I even have to go to the dermatologist becaus,This is not a drug that should be given for more than a couple of days. The body should not be subject to it's negative feelings of heart attack and doom taking over. I mean it.,F,,2  days10,1/6/2016,Lorazepam

19, 1, Panic attacks  anxiety,Ringing in the ears . Dry mouth _ shortness of breath  . Tremors _ headache _ depressed  anxiety _ panic _,I was given lorazepam in the emergency room for insomnia due to anxiety and panic . My doctor told me that my thyroid jump from hypo to hyper and I was having a bad reaction to my thyroid meds. He told me to take 1mg three times a day for 6 weeks until the thyroid medicine cleared out of my system . He did not inform me that this drug is very addicting  . I started taking 1mg every 12 hours . This worked for awhile but then I noticed I would become very jumpy and aggravated afte taking the dose . Doctor told me that this drug has an 8 hour life in your system . So pretty much waiting 12 hours I was withdrawling  in between doses . So changed to .5mg every 6 hours . That worked for about a day . I felt like crap . Over medicated and I was having the strangest thoughts running through my head . Went to every 7 hours for about a day . Then went to every 8 hours . I've been doing every 8 hours for about 4 days now . My body starts to crave it an hour before the time and now it doesn't even work . Sometime I feel worse . Jitters anxious on the verge of panic . I feel very stuck and very angry . How can I be going through withdrawl if it is in my system 24/7 ? I hate this drug and everytime I take a dose I feel like it takes my life from me . So afraid I will not get off it and worried about how I will feel when I am off of it . I don't recommend this to anyone and I will never take it again !! What a joke they give me one drug to counter react another .,F,51,2  months.5 mg,4/27/2015,Lorazepam

40, 1, Insomnia,I was prescribed this because I was having trouble sleeping around age 41.  Many other meds were tried and my dr finally put me on this. Gradually I had to increase the dosage and got up to 1 mg a day.  This went on for years. I realized the side effect were so bad but I could not get off of it. I tried and tried but would get so sick and could not sleep.  Finally I was going to church and got baptized by emersion.   I decided to try again for the umpteenth time.  I had scary nightmares which were demonic!  I could not sleep and only slept about 3 hours a night for a year!!  It has been around 18 months now and I am doing so much better.  I actually sleep between 5-6 hours a night   I still have side effects. When I came off it I thought I would die of a heart attack.  PLEASE PLEASE don't take this drug unless its only for a VERY short time. Definitely not over 3 days. THE WITHDRAWALS are so so brutal.

44, 5, Anxiety  & sleep,I have taken lorazepam for a while. I take 1mg at bedtime & have had no problems at all. If you take as your psych Dr prescribed you will have no issues. It's important to skip nights to keep from building a tolerance. Taken correctly it will  make your life easier to cope these days. Problems start when one sways away from prescribed amount & schedule. If you take it responsibly you should have no problems. I know people who take 6-8mg a day. That's asking for trouble. It's great for anxiety used correctly. If you have allergic reaction it's not the medication going bad_ it's your body not accepting it so can't really rate it bad. Good luck & calm wishes...,,F,60,4  years1 mg,5/30/2013,Lorazepam

I was so scared i started taking it again and thank god i got my sleep back however_ I am STUCK. If i try to stop it i get side effects and I cant deal with the insomnia. I am going to try to half the dose for a month however i am also scared that even halfing the dose will kickstart the insomnia. So I wonder if i have to take this drug for the rest of my life_ its a pretty scary thought because it makes me feel that I will fall down...dont know if that is a feeling or a real tendency...whatever it is_ I am damned if i stop it and damned if I dont. DONT TAKE THIS DRUG.....its better to suffer naturally..... the side effects are worst!.....I will try to reduce to 0.5mgs a day and I pray that my body can handle it and dont get insomnia.,M,37,12  months1.2mg 2X D,9/24/2012Email,Lorazepam

64, 1, severe insomnia,"I can not believe all the posts that said ""none"" for side effects.  I had to double check to see if we were discussing the same medication.  I have horrible side effects- slurred speech_ stumbling_ terrible brain fog and poor cognitive abilities to the point of effecting memory_ learning_ etc.  Yes_ it helped the insomnia and was the first drug to do so.  Bottom line though_ my side effects are so severe and disabling that I'm trying to titrate off and go back on amitriptyline which I used for insomnia for years in the past.  Doesn't any one else have these troubling side effects.  It has completely changed my life to a big black hole- I can't think or function.  I'm currently down to 0.75 mg at night and am pressing forward with my reduction until I'm off of this drug for good!",Once I'm off_ I will not ever use this drug again.

The drug has helped me cope w/anxiety caused by work/health problems; it's taken the edge off. I get little euphoria from the low dose_ tho sometimes I smoke weed in a.m. and the lorazepam half-life enhances that drug.However_ after three months the issues remain and I have to either make a real change or continue to rely on drugs_ however sparingly used_ to take edge off blunted lifestyle.,M,60,3  months.5 1X D,3/5/2012,Lorazepam

Haven't had any migraines since I started_ and I wake up more easily/feeling more rested.What I remember from last night was realizing I hadn't taken one of the medications I usually take in the morning_ so I took it shortly after taking the lorazepam. For the life of me I still can't remember what I took.

I came across it by accident_ my ex. mother in law took it for anxiety_ I ask to try some and immediately I had to go see my own Dr. for a script. My mind will go all night thinking about things_ I can fall asleep without it but not for long. If I run out of my meds (which I have) I get no sleep and dread the next day :-(   This has truly been the best med. ever made_ and I don't how I'd do without it_ I even tried to  wean myself off just to see and that was a horrible week.,M,44,7  years40 1X D,10/22/2011Email,Lorazepam

78, 5, Panic attacks,Tiredness / drowsiness_ but well worth this.,I've taken this drug since September 2008. I have panic attacks every once in a while_ and my physician at my university prescribed this for me. I rarely take the medication (only when I actually have an attack_ so possibly 10-15 per year). When I do take this_ it's a miracle worker. I am so relaxed afterwards_ and my panic attack subsides shortly afterwards. I do get a little tired or sleepy from taking it_ but it's actually quite nice to fall asleep after such a traumatic event. Having the medication on me is sometimes enough of an insurance policy than actually taking the drug. I would never even consider taking anything but lorazepam.,M,25,3  years0.5 mg 1X AN,8/19/2011Email,Lorazepam
79, 1, For anxiety after surgery,I had jaw surgery and suffered anxiety after the septum was collapsed and could not breathe.  I am 110 labs and the doctor prescribed 2 mg to be taken every  4 - 6 hours as needed for anxiety.  I took only at bedtime but because I was not eating but only taking limited calories_ I was hooked on drug and suffered serious side affects when I stopped taken it cold turkey.  Dry mouth_ body shaking_ possible seizure_ blackouts_ anxiety_ paranoia.  I ended up in a guarded hospital room on Friday_ May 13th 2011.  Before taking this medicine_ I run 15 miles a week_ workout to the point that I am in very good shape_ I eat organics and don't even ingest caffeine_  Well I was now hooked on this drug and in the hospital_ they wanted to put me back on to wean me off over the course of a month. I took a natural route after the hospital agreed to release me to the care of my homeopathic doctor.

The next day I would start feeling withdrawl symptom.,I want to get off this med.  I switched last week to trazadone for my sleeping problems.  however_ I don't think I am getting adequate assistance for tapering it off and have had the worst week and a half ever.  I have night sweats every night_ along with nightmares_ and during the day I lips feel numb_ I have hot flashes and my heart races.  Two nights ago I thought I was dying when I was trying to go to sleep without it.  My throat feels swollen_ I couldn't breathe_ and when I woke up all my muscles were sore.  I am concerned I may have had a small seizure.  After reading online_ apparently this med is not to be taken for long periods of time so why has my psych't had me on this junk for 4 years??  I want to get off of it so badly and had to start taking it again so I could function with life.  I seriously feel that I need to go to rehab to get off of this medication along with the anti-depressent I take.  I have been taking one medication for sleep (different varieties) / PTSD and one medication for anxiety/depression for over 10 years.  I am just done!  I used to feel like this was a wonder drug but know now that to get off of it_ or other anti-depressants_ turns your life into a living hell.  Please take this from my experience and be VERY careful if you decide to start taking it.  Make sure your psych't is on the ball and will help you get off of it and DO not stay on it for 4 years like I have.....,F,34,4  years 1X D,5/12/2011Email,Lorazepam
81, 5, Insomnia / Anxiety,None... good sleep?,"I must be strong as well. I originally took this drug because my doctor wanted to ""pretend"" I had anxiety. I got the best nights sleep ever and used it for that. Eventually the doctor wanted to take it away and I indicated that I needed it for sleep. I take exactly the same dose .5 mg (or less sometimes I cut it in 1/2) and I have never wanted more. That means_ at least for me_ it is not addictive. But yes_ I have a bad time sleeping without it. That makes me ""dependent"" on the drug.  Well_ you know... I don't care. It seems to correct something that was very very wrong with my body in the first place_ inability to sleep well.

I'm going through withdrawal at the moment and reading reviews about it_ I think it's been making me worse.,I've been on this for over two years i think. I take 1 mg at morning and one at night. It does have a quick effect for anxiety_ but I have a lot of the side effect symptoms. My prescription didn't refill and I've  been out for 3 days. haven't slept_ my eyesight is affected and I'm falling down dizzy and shaky. going through severe bouts of anxiety and mental disorder. Had to make emergency call to dr_ just got off the phone_ he's upset I haven't been monitored better. Stuff is highly addictive_ I'm not the addictive type_ but to those who are susceptible to it this would be hell. I'm obvisously addicted to this physically. I keep having to stop and reread cause I'm losing track minute to minute. I don't reccogmend it_ DON'T take it if you have addictioin problms. it is a controlled substance in the States and do some research_ it's scary. It has a faily high paradoxal rate_ which means it can have exactly the opposet reaction from what it's supposed to_ lots of reports of suicidal feelings. thought this stuff was a wonder drug_ it's hell in tablet form.,F,58,2  years1 mg 2X D,4/23/2011,Lorazepam

I dont remember the month or two I was on lorazepam and had to drop out of school. I felt like a zombie.. I was never happy or sad or anything I just ""was"". I had no emotions and was constantly spaced out. I had severe memory loss and it still affects my memory TODAY. I sometimes forget what I ate for breakfast.

86, 3, Anxiety/Panic Attacks,None,I only took this pill when I REALLY needed it.  If you take this drug or any other benzodiazapene on a regular basis you will become addicted to it.  If you have a substance abuse history or any addiction problems DO NOT TAKE THIS.  This medication is not meant to be taken all the time and can and will become very highly addictive.  This pill is wonderful for oncoming panic attacks and severe cases of anxiety but is not to be taken regularly_ only as needed.  I stopped taking it because I had most of one month's prescription left and hadn't taken any in over 3 months.  Again_ take this pill very carefully and only when you need it even if it says 2 times a day or something like that.  If you take this when you don't really need it_ not only is that abusing medication you WILL become addicted to it!  I can also tell you that being addicted to this medication and then trying to stop taking it can be hell on earth and also dangerous to your medical health.  So_ only take it when you really need it.  If you experience anxiety all the time you may need a non-controlled medication to take care of that since this is not meant for constant daily use.,F,28,1  years1.0 2X AN,2/5/2011Email,Lorazepam

Does exactly what it was intended to do - anti-anxiety!,I have taken lorazepam off and on for the past 5 years for severe anxiety_ panic attacks and terminal insomnia. It definitely can knock me out - even just .5 mg but it does make you not care anymore about your anxiety - which is great! It also puts me back to sleep within 1/2 hour early in the morning. It has done wonders for my panic attacks when flying - really made my life much better! It's highly addicting so I watch how much and how often I take it and only as really needed.

More sociable too_ as I had been hiding away from my friends. I do have a loss of appetite though_ but this is probably because Im not using food to calm the stress symptons.

I broke my thighbone and have multiple other leg injuries following a motorcycle accident and need something to relax and go to sleep - it relaxes me and puts me to sleep. No problem!,I wonder what kind of shape the folks having all of the problems on this drug are in_ or what they are taking along with it. I believe people in poor health to begin with seem to complain more about dependency and side effects. I am a healthy person who is not overweight or taking other mind-bending drugs other than percocet for pain - very little of that. I was having trouble keeping the injured leg still at rest after being relatively inactive all day in recovery. It's almost OCD_ I feel like I just have to move it_ I can't get the leg comfortable. The lorazapam makes me forget to keep moving the leg_ allowing me to relax and sleep. I have gone several nights without the pill to make sure I am not becoming dependent and have had no problems except the wiggling and inability to settle down. I eventually sleep fine_ no withdrawal symptoms.,F,42,45  days1mg 1X D,9/29/2010Email,Lorazepam
95, 4, post partum depression/anxiety,possible heart rate decrease?,I began taking Lorazepam after the birth of my last child in 1993. I had severe anxiety two months after the birth. Lorazepam helped me to sleep and to function somewhat. I was then put on Paxil which I continued for 8 years or more. I only took the prescribed 1mg daily (or less) of Lorazepam and 20 mg of Paxil. Periodically I attempted to get off both of the drugs over the years.I was finally able to be without the Paxil 8 years later. I continued on the Lorazepam only as needed which amounted to a few times per week rather than daily. In 2009 after the sudden death of my sister_ I was in depression again. This time I was prescribed Celexa for the depresson.It WORKS for me. I haven't felt this good in DECADES. Wow life can be GOOD. I haven't taken Lorazepam in months but just found out that I have BRADYCARDIA=slow heart beat.

I do get muscle cramps but checking to see if anything else is causing it. Sometimes:  headaches_ dizziness_ bump into things_ forgetfulness,It has really helped me through a very difficult time in my life.  I tried to go off it (cutting dose in half) and that was difficult. My body didn't like it_ so am consulting naturopathic doc with help to do so.

All of you people who are taking this every day or more than once a day whem you dont need it are making a mistake.  The key to this drug is to take it when you feel a panic attack coming on.  There are many other anti anxiety drugs to help people that are not controlled substances.  Paxil_Lexapro_amd Zoloft are a few.  Lorazepam just calms you down you need to actually treat the disorder instead of masking it.  Only take them when needed and if you get an anti-anxiety med you will not need the lorazepam as often.,F,32,3  years.5 2X D,7/11/2010,Lorazepam

But I have still had A panic attack_ jus one which all the medicine was make it from one of those -AHHHH_ CAN'T BREATH_ DAMN_ DAMN_ DAMN_- moments to a -Leave me alone!- moment.

102, 5, Anxiety/Panic/Insomnia,Drowsy if taking full dose. Lucid dreaming,I take a 1/4 to 1/2 pill for terminal insomnia - early waking. It relaxes me just enough so I can fall back asleep or at least doze. The lucid dreaming is not scary - just interesting. For my panic attacks before flying_ I take 1 mg to 1.5 mg - I am fully alert as I am so keyed up but the lorazepam prevents me from panicking - amazing! Once I'm off the plane_ I am completely stoned! If I want the full effect for my GAD_ then I have to take 1 mg and can't do that while working - too drowsy and spaced - but 1/4 to 1/2 takes the edge off. Over all_ this drug has really helped me and I am not addicted as I take only when needed. I use meditation/yoga to manage my anxiety as much as possible.,F,38,5  years1 mg 1X AN,5/25/2010,Lorazepam

Walked into doors_ tripped over things_ could not remember what I just thought of a few seconds earlier_ became extremely tired_ and when I did sleep at night_ I had very bizarre vivid dreams.

106, 1, Anxiety,SEVERE AND PROGRESSIVELY WORSENING DEPRESSION_ SUICIDAL THOUGHTS_ ATTEMPTED SUICIDE_ ADDICTION TO THE DRUG,"Our family doctor initially prescribed Lorazepam for anxiety attacks I was having.  Without realizing it_ I got addicted to it while using it on a regular daily basis.  As time went on_ I needed more and more of it to get over what I thought were the same anxiety attacks - or so I thought.  I now believe I was having ADDICTION symptoms of the drug_ continuously needing more and more of it to satisfy my addiction to it!!!  I finally ended up taking 6 - 8 mg/day just to get to sleep.  My doctor did not monitor my usage and just kept increasing my dosage ""I"" thought I needed when I requested it_ not realizing what was happening to me.  My doctor also did not monitor the length of time I was on it_ which ended up being about 20 months!  About the same time I started needing larger doses was when the suicidal thoughts came in_ which was 15 months ago.  As time went on_ Lorazapam caused more and more severe depression for me_ which resulted in an attempted suicide a few weeks ago_ after feeling totally hopeless in life. After ending up in the hospital and under psychiatric care_ I am now recovering and almost completely done with the severe withdrawal from the drug.  My mood and outlook on life are finally returning to normal.  While Lorazapam did take care of the initial anxiety attacks for me_ it also ended up CAUSING them!!!  Be extremely careful in using this drug on a regular basis_ and DO NOT stay on it for ANY length of time!!!!  Better yet_ avoid Lorazapam complet",M,50,20  months2 MG 3X D,3/28/2010,Lorazepam

Recently_ I was desperate again for something to help me sleep and last week took a single 1 mg table one night and for the next two nights took half a tablet each night.  I couldn't imagine that small a dosage over a total of only three nights could turn my world upside down_ but it did.  I literally wonder if I'm dying.  I haven't slept in days and have depression severe enough where I'm crying all the time.  I haven't taken it now in about three nights but I think this drug is so dangerous and immediately addictive that it takes forever to get out of your system even at these small doses.  I don't recommend this medication for anyone and_ if you should decide to take it anyhow_ make sure your doctor is monitoring you every step of the way.

My taper was too fast. Three months later_ I still have insomnia and anxiety which far surpass my original problem.

Im in college and almost missed a semester because of it. Ended up in the hospital with gastro problems and could not eat solid food for months. I will never take this med or any others again if I don't have to! Beware of this med and research it first.,F,40,8  weeks,2/15/2007,Lorazepam
154, 4, Occassional Severe Anxiety Attacks,Be careful driving.  I drove off the road once after taking 4mg in a six hour period.  It was stupid to take that much and it could have cost me dearly.  Also_ do NOT order from overseas.  That stuff made me VERY sick.  Stay with a legal prescription and follow the rules or you will pay the price.,This is in some ways a wonder drug_ but it has a dark side.  You start taking it only for critical situations_ this gradually shift to using it for any situation where you might feel anxious.  That is the trap.  Do NOT fall into the trap and you should be OK.,M,50,1.3  years,1/10/2007,Lorazepam
155, 2, aniety,fatigue,"It definetly helped calm me when I was having a panic attack but it left me in a fog. I started on this drug b/c I was given it at the ER when went in b/c I finally couln't handle my panic attacks. I was taking it for a while this past summer and took it during class and nearly fell asleep. Not very good! I'm taking Lexapro long term and instead of Lorazepam for those ocasional panic attacks I take Alprozolam(Xanax). It decreases my panic attacks just as well as Lorazepam but without the tiredness and ""fog"".",F,21, ,11/1/2006,Lorazepam
156, 4, PMS/insomnia/anxiety,The only side effect I noticed was drowsiness_ but depending on why you are taking them this can be beneficial.,"I've been taking this ""as needed"" for well over 10 years (60 x 2mg tablets_ max_ per year). There has not been very much decrease in its effectiveness over the years_ because I use it sparingly (and with a healthy fear of addiction). I give it only a rating of '4' because they are mostly useful when you can plan in advance to take them (sleep after a stressful day_ dental procedures_ etc.). They are not always as helpful for the occasional anxiety attack_ especially if I've recently eaten something. Before they kick in I was often already beginning to get over it.",F,43,15  years,7/16/2006,Lorazepam
157, 5, sleep - anxiety kept me awake,None_ except that it allows me to sleep,"Upon the death of my father and the ensuing family ""issues_"" I asked my doctor for something that would prevent my mind from racing all night long (which kept me from sleeping). I do not care for drugs_ but this one works for me. Unlike most of the people taking Lorazepam_ I do not have much anxiety as I have since resolved the problematic issues in my family. However_ I still use Lorazepam sporatically when I suspect I may not be able to get a good night's sleep. Half or one-third a dose does it for me_ and I wake up absolutely fine.",F,52,3  years,5/5/2006,Lorazepam
158, 3, Anxiety,mild stomach pain,It worked well at the beginning_ but I feel that the longer I take it the less it works.  The doctor upped the number of times to take it each day from one to three times. I have heard that it is a very addictive drug_ and I count the hours between doses looking forward to the next (although I take it only as directed). Because of this I'm going to ask my doctor to change my medication to something with more of a long-term result that is not as addictive.,F,21,1  months,1/4/2006,Lorazepam
159, 3, Anxiety /Panic Attacks,I use to take it as needed but when I had a Hypoglycemic and vertigo and a Panic attack all at once and ended up in the Emergency room I started taking it more offten at first every other night 1 MG and now every night .5 mg I lowered the dose my self thinking I could make it last longer and did not want to get addicted to a higher does. But now been taking it since September  2005 almost 4 months now and I have been having side effects of_ Drowsiness_ dizziness_ weakness_ fatigue _ blurred vision _BAD headaches_ gastrointestinal (Gallstones)_ one of the worst side effects are respiratory disturbances (hard to breath through out day and can not even walk with out restrictions. once in a while I use to get heart Palpitations but now I get every day and several a day of irregular heartbeat and Heart Palpitations_ Eyes: sensitivity of eyes to light; tingling_ burning ( like a fever would make it feel)_ Both Eyes hurt upper like straining in side or bulging feeling deep inside upper eye ba,I have been waiting for my other Dr appointment who I don't see till end of January 2006 to get on different medication for my Anxiety and Panic attacks but they have have such a long waiting list that now I have been on this medication too long and now starting to have symptoms this last month they have gotten worse. If only they could of seen me sooner I would not be going through this. They were suppose to see me right after my referral to them in September that is when I first started this medication but they did not contact me till December to make an appointment pretty weird I think. Well all I can say is good luck it does work for short term but it is not meant to be taken long term.,F,36,4  months,1/3/2006Email,Lorazepam

161, 1, bipolar_ anxiety,"I have recently come up on felony charges due to the severe side effects of this medicine. At first I only took the dose recommended then more cause I felt that ""it was not working to relax me the way they said it should"" then I took more and more of this medicine to relax and calm me down. I now have absolutely no memory of the times that I was taking this medicine or my actions while on this medication. If anyone else has had severe side effects of this medication or wants to know more about my experience with this medication please contact me at rrachaelr80@aol.com",I feel that much more research is needed to be done on this medication due to my and others severe memory loss while on this medication.,F,24,2  months,9/7/2005Email,Lorazepam

163, 3, anxiety,none.,It was almost as good as diazepam (valium)_ but it just wasn't strong enough to relax me. I'm very high strung.,M,23,2  weeks,11/3/2004Email,Lorazepam

165, 5, severe anxiety neurosis and panic,None,I take lorazepam as a PRN (ie. when needed) to calm me right down when I'm panicking_ anxious or having severe disturbing thoughts. This is a strong benzodiazepine_ and it works wonders for me_ even at a low dose of 1mg. It lasts for around 6 hours_ sometimes longer for me. It does have a high potential for addiction_ but I only need it every other day on average. I also take 50mg Paxil and 7.5mg zopiclone daily and they have no obvious interactions with the Paxil_ but I wouldn't use it together with zopiclone because of the CNS Depressant effects of both medications.,M,28,1  years,5/22/2004,Lorazepam
