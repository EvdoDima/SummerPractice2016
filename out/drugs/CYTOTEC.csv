1, 4, Managed miscarriage,"I had a good experience with this drug (as in it induced my labor and did its job)_ however I believe if your body isn't capable of ""aborting"" all tissue_ no matter if you take this or not_ it won't. My body didn't and lead to serious complications NOT related to this medicine. The only actual side effects I had from taking this_ was miscarriage symptoms. Cramping and bleeding. Diarrhea and nausea is also common but didn't happen for me.",This med did what it was supposed to do for me. I recommend getting a string pain reliever (ie: hydrocodone)with it because cramping does get very Intense atop an already emotionally painful situation.,F,26,1  days4pills vag,4/7/2016,Cytotec
2, 1, Labor induction,Placental abruption_ uterine rupture,During labor_ they gave me this stuff to induce me. They gave me quite a bit_ did not inform me of the risks_ or anything. I ended up with an emergency c-section due to placental abruption and uterine rupture caused by the drug and ended up with my daughter in the NICU.,F,27,1  days 1X D,12/18/2014,Cytotec
3, 5, miscarriage management blighted ovum,Complete evacuation_ like a natural miscarriage. With correct dosages this works in up to 95% of first trimester miscarriages.,I was afraid to have a D&C because my friend got Asherman's syndrome from one. She recommended this instead. My doctor gave me both options and I chose cytotec. I would recommend Cytotec to anyone who is interested in preserving their fertility.,F,37,1  days800mcgx2 1X D,10/8/2010,Cytotec
4, 2, Fibromagelia & pinched cspine nerve,Blew up like a balloon_ elephantitus looking legs & ankles.  Finger circulation cut off by rings...terrible reaction!,It took about a week to come down from the swelling.  My ankles hurt so bad & were so swollen_ wow...nasty reaction for me!,F,44,1  days,2/23/2008,Cytotec
5, 1, medically managed miscarriage,Horrible cramping that extended down my legs.  Did not effectively complete my miscarriage.,This drug was recommended to me as the least invasive way to complete my miscarriage (embryo 2 weeks behind in development with no cardiac activity).  The doctor did not mention that it is often not effective in one dose (or even after two doses_ though I doubt I could have convinced myself to take it again).  I returned for a follow up visit a week later and learned that the miscarriage was still not complete_ and had to schedule a D&C anyway.  I would definitely recommend the D&C over this drug any day.,F,35,1  days,4/4/2007,Cytotec
