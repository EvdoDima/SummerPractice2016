0, 5, Anxiety due to alcohol and cocaine,Side effects were minor or almost non existant. It's when you try to stop taking this benzodiazepine that the real problem begins_ because your CNS depends on it_ in order to function.,Take Ativan only for a short period of time if necesarry. It is a drug (OPIOID) just like what you find on the streets_ only legal because it is prescribed by a Dr. Don't let any Dr. tell you that this is a maintenance drug for you_ it is not. It is a powerful drug that start at low doses and your body and mind want more..this is why it is a controlled substance. SHORT TERM USE 7 DAYS MAX AND YOU SHOULD BE OK...SAY NO TO BENZOS!!!,M,44,1  years2 mg a day,8/12/2016Email,Ativan

4, 5, Anxiety,None other then the physiological urge to take the Ativan.,Due to some health issues_ I was having a high level of anxiety daily which also led to some depression. Ativan was fast acting and helped calm me down when the anxiety felt unbearable. It did not really help me sleep. I started taking Melatonin for sleep and then I was able to stop taking the Ativan. I'm glad I never started taking the antidepressants the doctors had prescribed.,M,62,2  months.5mg 1X D,6/6/2016,Ativan

I'm working part time again.,The only problem that I have ran into has been my regular Pharmacy all of a sudden decided they would not fill the prescription even after calling the  psychiatrist.

7, 5, Panic attack,"I experienced panic attacks severe at about 30. Worked very well. I am now 68. So I have taken this med for over 35 years. I have over 500 scuba dives_ jumped out of air planes_ made over 200 speeches and worked on ambulance for two years. No side effects at all. I take 1 mg x day. The only problem is getting off fast. I was on 3 Mg a day now 1 mg. it caused my heart to skip withdrawing.  My cardio Doc said ""why quit"".  Really. I have probably been on this med as long as anyone. No ill effects. It does have a bad effect I have seen in about 1 in 10 people I know. They became very agitated. Also I don't use this for sleep. I have no other illness and take no other meds.  If you can't sleep try over the counter Unisom. This is an over the counter med and works very well. Give it a chance.",,M,68,10  years2,4/19/2016Email,Ativan

10, 1, Insomnia,For several years Ativan worked well in helping me get to sleep (2mg)_ then getting me back to sleep when I woke up at 4 am.(1mg)_ until I went into tolerance withdrawal_ a truly hellish experience. Have not been able to sleep more than a few hours each night_ and now have debilitating anxiety attacks during the day. Each morning I wake up on the Cortisol Express and cannot calm down. Only higher doses can stop it_ and now that I'm trying to taper off this terrible drug_ the withdrawal has been horrific_ with worse insomnia and panic than what caused me to take it in the first place.,Don't even start benzodiazepines_ because getting off them is worse than anyone could possibly imagine. Once you develop tolerance withdrawal it will be too late to prevent this hell.,F,60,4  years3 mg,4/2/2016,Ativan

It has been over 24 hrs since I took the 1 mg dose and I am still dizzy and light headed.

16, 5, PTSD/ constant anxiety& panic attac,Dont feel like myself. No desire to eat_now i just want to barrel through work_ go straight home and hide under my covers in bed. (which is impossible. I have two small children) Although i get relief from the discomfort of constant severe anxiety_ im now terrified being without my meds. Ive ran out 3 times thinking i could be fine. WRONG. the withdrawls are worse than the anxiety and are far more severe. I become dizzy_ weakness in arms and legs_ tunnel vision_ panic attacks that last longer and are HELL_ cant sleep because of anxiety_ vivid crazy nightmares! I get more anxiety when im running low because i dread what happens when i run out. Because im waiting for my insurance plan to freaking start_ i've been to the ER three times for refills this last month 1/2!  I never imagined i could be this dependant on medication. The E.R sure likes to send you home with them then expect you to just_ BAM! stop taking them knowing how addictive they are_ then they question you about why you're back for a refill. It makes no sense! Hello! Yes_ im back because i think im dying and ativan is what takes the horrible withdrawls away. Duh! WELL I GUESS I AM AN ADDICT THEN. I need Ativan to literally function and go to work now. Benzo's are the worst to ween off of. And stopping cold turkey could cause seizures.,,F,31,2  months2 mg daily,1/17/2016,Ativan

I've been on EVERYTHING for my panic disorder... all the SSRIs_ Effexor_ trileptal_ gabapentin_ buspar_ propranolol_ lamictal_ betaxtol_ prazosin with no luck but this medication works. No side effects except some sleepiness. When I took Ativan it was the most normal I'd felt in a long time_ and it lasts for a good 8-12 hours too. I was only given it for exams though_ and as if now I'm stuck with buspar again which does nothing for me but make me sick to my stomach. My doctor refuses to give to me again because of the risk of addiction_ but I've tried everything else and some of the other meds he's put me on have had some dangerous side effects that have almost killed me.

29, 3, Severe Anxiety,Ativan worked great until I became addicted to it. I lost 2 years of my life to this drug. I can't even recall most of that 2 year period. I really needed to go to rehab but my husband along with my dr supervised my weaning off of it. Even weaning off was HORRIBLE. Worst anxiety that lasted a LONG A TIME. Even worse than what I EVER experienced before I took it.,Please do NOT let your doctor prescribe this to you on a long term basis.

Ativan helped me through a really tough emotional time when I felt like I couldn't take on basic day to day tasks like showering. 30 mins after taking I was calm and able to focus on work like a normal person. Only downside is that it is addictive otherwise I would take it everyday for as long as I needed. So so helpful.,F,29,4  weeks 1X D,9/9/2015,Ativan

32, 4, Anxiety,None,Ativan is great to help with anxiety but I can't say it enough.....don't take it for long periods of time!! I was on it for 2 years when I found out I was pregnant they made me stop taking it immediately and the withdrawal was terrible. I swore I would never take it again but my anxiety got the best of me_ I tried weaning off of it recently and the anxiety was HORRIBLE so I started taking my normal dosage again. I will prob be on this medication for the rest of my life_ please do yourself a favor and don't take it daily (as my doctor prescribed) it is very addictive and very hard to get off of.

36, 1, Anxiety due to health issue,Initially helped but this was very short lived. Blacked out trying to get off this-was not told how addicting it was. Literally the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life and it lasted months. Had to switch to Klonopin in order to wean off benzos. I would never take this again.

After slowly removing myself off the drug with a gradual decrease of a period of 4weeks mentally I feel fine_physically not so much. I have been getting abdominal cramps and given that I already have issues with my stomach it adds to it. When I thought back when I first started taking it I remembered my bowel movements started to increase significantly_ now being off the drug I notice they have decreased quite a bit.

I was with a customer at lunch and blacked out an had seizures. Was taken to ER where they gave me Ativan and everything was fine. Obviously I was addicted but had NO clue until that day. It took me months to get ""off"" this drug with the help of the Ashton manual and a forum which has since been closed. This experience was one of the worst of my life but I'm one of the lucky ones.",I kicked my doctor prescribed addiction several years ago. I follow this web site occasionally to see how others are faring. I believe this drug class_ including Ativan_ Xanax_ Valium and so on is one of the most serious drug problems in America (and maybe the world). These drugs are being prescribed to millions of people_ many of whom have very bad experiences as they build tolerance and become addicted. Do a Google search and read the stories for yourself. MANY lives have been devastated by this drug and others.

42, 4, stress,Getting agitated day after I take a dose.,I  take Ativan 1mg. maybe once a week_ maybe 2 times in a week.  I was prescribed it for stress_ but I found it to be great in the evening to help me ease in to a nice sleep_ which is has.   I was taking Ambien prior_ but found the ativan much more pleasant to take than Ambien..   The issue I'm having with this drug is that I have noticed a pattern whereby_ the very next day after taking the drug the night before_ I get agitated_ and I end up provoking an absolute fight with my husband on things I wouldn't ordinarily even pay attention to.  It happens every time.  I wonder if anyone else has had this experience.  It makes me afraid to take ativan at night knowing I'm going to be irritable the next day.  Otherwise_ I love this drug for sleep.  I would never take this drug every day_ and certainly never take more than 1mg.  Is this a side effect other people have experienced?,F,54,2  months1 1X W,3/25/2015,Ativan
43, 1, For anxiety,Shakes_ muscle aches_ insomnia_ nauseousness_ extreme anxiety_ depression_ buzzing in my ears_ heart palps_ shortness of breath.,I would not recommend taking this drug. I was on .5mg for only 2 weeks for my anxiety attacks. Yes_ it worked at night so I could sleep peacefully_ but once I stopped taking it_ the withdrawals began horrifically and that's just from 2 WEEKS!!! I wish my doctor never would have prescribed this to me. She did tell me that it was highly addictive and for that reason she was just going to give me enough for a couple weeks to calm my nerves. She did not explain to me what could happen to you if you just stop taking it cold turkey. I understand that everybody is different and some may not even experience withdrawals from ativan only after a few weeks_ but like I said... everybody is different and she still should have explained to me what could happen. My body reacted very badly to this drug. I'm now just starting to feel a little better. The last few days were excruciating for me. The anxiety attacks came on so intense. I could not sit still from the shakes_ I constantly felt nauseous_ I was having digestive problems_ I could not sleep at all! I was awake for 24 hours and being awake that long is just going to feed into your anxiety. I was so restless_ I had absolutely no appetite. If I even tried to put food to my mouth_ I felt like I was automatically going to vomit. I had a racing heart_ and I cried uncontrollably_ I also had buzzing in my ears. My muscles started to ache so bad from constantly shaking and being so tense. The worst part was definitely the anxiety that came on,F,25,2  weeks.5 mg,2/12/2015Email,Ativan

46, 1, Panic/insomnia,Intradose withdrawals began within days_ experienced somnolence_ crying off and on all day_ depression_ suicidal thoughts_ no motivation for anything_ wanted to hide away from the world.,"I was given Ativan after an ER visit for heart palpitations_ told the physician I could use something to get some sleep and get back on track since I was having anxiety and difficulty coping with events in my life. Big mistake! I began taking .5 mg to sleep. First three nights it worked great. Then in the morning I felt a bit ""off"" and felt like it would be okay if I took a quarter of one (.25 mg). I did this for several days in a row (.50 at night_ .25 in the morning) and quickly began having crying spells during the day. I know what it is to be depressed but this was a very deep depression that just came up so quickly out of nowhere. I ended up acting psycho with an ex boyfriend and also drank at a party and raged on some people there (granted they WERE real jerks but still_ not my style). I was afraid to cut back because I felt like I didn't want to live as it was_ but I am now on day 2 of having cut out the morning dose_ and tonight I'm going to cut the .50 in half. I've been taking loads of niacin (NOT the non-flushing kind)_ I'm taking about 6 100mg pills a day spaced out with food_ this has had a calming effect on me so I'm not taking anything out on anyone. I'm just keeping to myself_ unable to get out of bed really_ crying up a storm over silly things_ worst than when I was pregnant. Feeling that life has no meaning.

47, 5, PMS Anxiety,I have taken Ativan sporadically over the years as needed_ during times of intense anxiety (usually when my PMS clashes with difficult relationships). I just started taking it again after about 7 years off and I'm noticing some fatigue_ lack of ambition...but I think my adrenals and nervous system are already really depleted and Ativan's anxiety reduction is just putting me in touch with how tired I really am.,I absolutely LOVE Ativan. Life can be really hard sometimes. I am an advanced meditator_ yogi_ and holistiic healing professional_ and I know that there are many ways to deal with stress...but sometimes life gets the best of me and when PMS stacks up against PTSD with a big heaping dose of relationship drama or family drama_ I have a really hard time keeping my cool. I have had such bad anxiety attacks that I feel like I can't breathe and that I'm having heart palpitations. When I feel the ice cold hit of cortisol hitting my bloodstream in an intense relationship argument or situation_ I know that it's all over for the day and I'll be just trying to hang on by my fingernails to be able to cope with the day. Ativan changes all of this for me. I only take a half dose_ as needed. My prescription says to take 2 a day_ but I only take about 2 or 3 a week during even the worst stretches of anxiety. One half dose just stops the physiological stress reaction in it's tracks_ and allows me to process the situation with a calm_ cool and collected mind. The heart palpitations and overwhelm vanish_ and I can see the problem clearly and deal with it rationally. Lately I've noticed that I seem to be feeling pretty tired after taking a full dose_ but it's not any more tired than I would have been had I been dealing with an anxiety attack all day and night. I love Ativan and I like to have it available to me when I need it. I've never been inclined to abuse substances_ so for me_ it's a wonde,F,40,10  years1/2 dose 3X W,12/20/2014Email,Ativan

I also was on it for insomnia_ and social anxiety. I had on and off times where I tended to struggle with more depression when got on it and didn't realize it cause more depression and not heal that but it did help some panic attacks for awhile until now. It stopped working sometimes and I think it has me tolerant or dependance on it that gets me overwhelmed so slowy getting off of it since now on clonazepam see too if that helps or not. But these are very dangerous and must be cautious at all times. Lorazepam made me gained more weight too and increased appetite_ and sometimes made me cry more even when it help me sometimes sleep. I just hate struggle with panic attacks. I tried antidepressants like Paxil and Prozac but not good either. I felt very sad and hopeless since I have not many to talk to.I also have no friends too so this makes me even more worse. I am trying to withdrawal lorazepam nice and slowly hope it goes well and clonazepam. I started 4 days ago hope it helps cause it slowly process one.

Addictive.  I stopped due to news about Ativan and dementia from long term use. My brain felt better in 3 days.  The 5th day I thought  I would die from the withdrawal symptoms.  You can go into convulsions I found out later.,I wanted to die every day.  I prayed for it.  I stopped on September 10_ 2014.

They did the job. Never had a panic attack again. I have never had any reaction at all. I have flown airplanes_ jumped out of planes_ scuba dived for 15 years with over 500 dives_ rode Harley's for 20 years and gave over 1000 presentations_ and have been a lead medic on an ambulance and have never had any side affects.

Still experience some symptoms (primarily anxiety and headache) after tapering off 4 months ago.,Be very cautious if you are taking ativan long term (>2-3 weeks).

I thought I was having a stroke. This happened twice_ and searching online_ I realized I was addicted. This drug was very difficult for me due to its short half-life and the anxiety it caused (much more than the original anxiety I had)_ and I chose to go through an online tapering program_ Point of Return_ rather than up the dose. Best choice I could have ever made even though it was still very difficult on a slow taper_ as I switched to Klonopin with its longer half-life.

Not because it doesn't work_ it will sedate you and calm you down_ however_ it is probably the most addictive for me_ as well_ the withdrawal is drawn out and miserable.  Memory loss is unpleasant_ and the ultimate problem with Ativan is that it doesn't kick in right away like Xanax or Valium_ and doesn't last nearly as long as Klonopin_ Xanax XR_ or even Valium.  My dosage_ as you would read_ got way out of control_ and I had to shelve the Ativan after less than a year.

Daily use is what eventually hooks approx. 60% of us_ and the majority of doctors are clueless in this particular area of medicine. Though great in the beginning_ I underwent a series of spinal surgeries requiring detoxing from the pain meds as well as benzos_ and any detox center that says they can get you off of them in a matter of weeks doesn't know their neurochemistry about benzos.

As happy as the newbies who just started taking them are_ they have no clue what's in store if they ever try to quit.

After that racing heart rate_ fear_ anxiety_ vertigo_ horrible thoughts_ agoraphobia_ claustrophobia_ and the list goes on and on,I actually posted my experience on this drug from hell two years ago but got an email this morning asking me about how I got off of this roller coaster called Ativan.  I will say this again... This drug for me was the drug from hell.  My situation did not call for medicating any form of anxiety but it was the Doctors that opted for this method.  What I got was a boat load of horrifying symptoms that this little pill is suppose to fight against.  I begged the Doctors to do research on why I was falling a part after starting this pill but they refused.  Within a day I was experiencing severe interdosal withdrawals.  In two months time I had lost nearly 40lbs and was a mess.  Since the very community that is suppose to help me wouldn't I decided I'd get off that pill myself and did the following... keep in mind although my side effects were severe I'd only been on this for 2 months.  I tapered a 1/4 every three days.  But I found that 10 mg of inderal once a day just as the withdrawals would get too severe would help me edge off that horror for a few hours.  After the final 3 days on the last 1/4 I stopped.  For about 7 days the intense withdrawals slowly got less and less.  After one week I felt a bit more like myself.  I continued to take only 10 mg of inderal in the evening for one additional week and then stopped taking it and there were no continued problems.,M,37,2  months.25 3X D,2/23/2013Email,Ativan

123, 1, Anxiety,It was a miserable experience. It calmed me at first but bother my stomach all the time. I started with .5 mg and could drive on it but after a few weeks I stopped and started Xanax for a few weeks which really helped. It was strong at even .25 mg and it wasn't something that could let me drive unless I drank coffee redbull or had an energy pill. So I could drive if I took xanax a few hrs prior. I thought I was going to get a full prescription for Xanax but my doctor said no and gave me Ativan and Zoloft. Ativan didn't work so I upped it to 1 mg and refused the zoloft. Zoloft made me throw up basically... Anyways_ the 1 mg worked for a few months until I upped it to 1.5 mg so I took 3 pills at a time. I did this because it gave me terrible tremors and such. Finally doctor gave me .5 mg klonopin and I'm starting to feel much better. Ativan is a hit or miss...

Not completely apathetic but not really enthused about anything? On top of being sort of empty inside_ I've been getting horrible headaches every single day. My period cramps are also not really doing me any favours. I have horrible short term memory now and often forget simple things as soon as I hear them.

129, 5, Occasional Panic Attacks,None,I've suffered with anxiety for 40 years. In the 70s I was taking Valium_ quit cold turkey (which they didn't know was a no-no) which increased the anxiety. I learned how to cope with it without medication. I was given Ativan 7 years ago while in the hospital dealing with ulcerative colitis.  I break the .5 in half and never take more than that.  Ever. I don't take it every day.  Mild anxiety is a normal human condition; every gets it now and then.  One should be able to cope with that using one's own inner strength. Many people commenting here could be on other meds that are contraindicated for Ativan. And_ I have to say_ I am shocked at some of the dosages.  But to each his/her own. For me_ .25 PRN works.

I may have to double the dose to get through this one.  (Seriously people_ you are shocked that you have anxiety when you stop taking the pill that helps control anxiety? Perhaps its not the pill causing it but rather the condition that caused you to be prescribed it in the first place)  This drug is an amazing drug and if used as prescribed you should not get addicted and it is impossible to continue having withdrawal symptoms from a drug after it is out of your system which certainly doesn't take a year as some people have described.,F,36,2  years.5 3X AN,2/13/2012Email,Ativan

My doctor originally gave me 5 pills on December 30 and I just took my last one yesterday on February 9. I am not scared of becoming addicted because I will not allow it to happen! When I get a panic attack_ I wait a while to see if I can calm myself down on my own first and then decide if I need to take a pill. I can usually calm myself down but Ativan is my fall back if I absolutely feel that I need it. It works very well. It takes about half an hour for me to completely calm down.

I started having worse and worse anxiety bc of mystery symptoms appearing. This happened for 3.5 years! Bad crazy mystery symptoms! Finally a few months ago I had tolerance w/d! It was like someone opened the gates to Hell and kicked me in. You see.. since I was a yoyo user... I had been going through Benzo w/d off and on for 3.5 years! It also causes anxiety from hell withdrawaling. I had to reinstate the ativan and ween off if it over a 2yoyo month period. Im 50 days Benzo free and still suffering. It could take a year to heal. I was a fool. These pills will bite you in the butt one day guys... they are ONLY supposed to be prescribed for 2 weeks MAX! Thats how fast the gaba receptors gain a STRONG dependency! Do NOT take benzos! Its an epidemic!  Drs are handing them out like candy! They say they are harmless.  And they will deny you are going through w/d after 50 days clean. Its insane!  Do your research folks! There's a 100+ page manual out there called the Ashton Manual how to get off these drugs. And lists over 270 w/d symptoms that can last for years!

In my history_ night is when ""the bad stuff happened""_ so when evening falls_ the frequency and intensity of my stressful thoughts/morid scenarios_ teeth grinding and tics go way up. The Ativan effect wipes all of that clean away and gets me in a nice mood to go to bed. It's difficult to say if it's only the Ativan that's causing me to have difficulty with my cognitive functions because I also take Trileptal (900 mg. 1 x day)_ which definitely exacerbates the situation. Unfortunately_ I've tried life without either_ and it's a difficult trade-off_ as I'm sure most of you know. You take the side-effects so that you can function like a noral human being.

My Dr. kept increasing the dosage of it when I did not improve. I got sicker and felt crazy! I was switched to Ativan as a ""milder"" choice. Ater 8 mos of taking 3 mgs of Ativan_ split into 4 doses_ my family insisted that I ""detox"" as I was threatening suicide on a regular basis. I was going to admit myself to a local psych unit_ but no beds were available_ so I started to reduce at home with help of my counselor_ family_ and psychiatrist. (I had to argue with my psychiatrist who wasn't sure I knew my own body well enough) I am on month 9 of my reductions and now only take 1/8 mg per day.  My body is totally addicted to this med and punishes me with each withdrawal. I am very sick for at least a week until my body/brain adjust to the reduction. If I reduce by more than 1/4 mg_ I fall apart!  I lost a full year of quality living on this med. I realize now that had I been given holistic or cognitive methods to deal with the panic attacks_ I would not have needed any meds. (I already take a low dose of Citalapragm for anxiety/depression) I would never recommend a benzo for anxiety usage.

163, 1, Anxiety,Without my being aware of the debilitating impact of this powerful BENZODIAZEPINE_ I encountered LONG-TERM side effects_ including SEVERE physical_ cognitive & emotional impairment.  Ativan potentially causes a PARADOXICAL effect....meaning that the reason you are taking it will actually become a PRIMARY symptom to dramatically worsen & complicate the situation.,RED ALERT:  If I knew THEN what I know NOW_ I NEVER would have taken Ativan.  My psychiatrist neglected to inform me the important details of Ativan being potentially ADDICTIVE & HARMFUL after taking the LOWEST dosage for only 7-10 days.  Ativan turned my life into a living hell on earth.  Within a few short months of taking the smallest dose only as needed_ my cognitive function became IMPAIRED to the point where I could not even recall my own telephone number.  I am a professional writer and I literally could NO longer function....I was forced to stop writing_ due to the damaging cognitive function.

The smallest amount of stress or difficulties would instantly send me into a hostile fit_ breaking things & screaming like a lunatic.  I HATED THE PERSON ATIVAN TURNED ME INTO!!!!  My circumstance with Ativan became much more complicated because I was prescribed Cymbalta to treat Fibromyalgia.  Without my knowing it_ the two medications had SEVERE INTERACTIONS_ which contributed to my dramatic change in personality_ behavior & impaired cognitive function.  In Oct 2010_ during a horrifying taper off Cymbalta_ I reached rock bottom & overdosed on Ativan.

Several times I did not take it to see how my labrynthitis was_ I got extremely ill_ but did not know it was due to withdrawal.  After 6 weeks I was dependent but had to stop it for tests.

This started me on a downward spiral of being handed so many medications to deal with my ""anxiety""_ with many horrific side effects.

I had agoraphobia and was housebound for 2 years_ I was taking 0.5 MG when I would have mild panic attacks at home_ drowsiness was the only side effect I had_ but after a week or so it went away. One day my family decided I needed to get help so they gave me 2 MG of Ativan and_ after 2 years of not leaving my yard_ I was able to drive myself to the hospital and check myself in to get therapy. That was 2 months ago_ now I take 1 MG 3 times daily and I have not had a problem leaving the house since_ its a miracle drug for me and I thank God for the doctor who prescribed it to me. I will take it daily for as long as I need to_ until I feel comfortable without it through the help of therapy.

174, 5, Panic Attack,None,In my 30s had severe panic attacks when having to give speaches..I had never had this problem before..my job was giving speeches..so I found Ativan..this drug kept me from having panic attacks for 30 years.  I watched the amount I took and was careful never to exceed 3 mg 3 pills in the morning.  I never fet I had to take more than that. It takes sometime to get off Ativan.  It does not cure panic attacks.  It keeps you from getting them. After 30 years I decided I wanted off these pills and I would drop the dosage down to 2 then 1 then off..I had no more panic attacks maybe due to my system changing over the years. The problem that it did cause was that after stopping this drug I would develop heart dysrhythems.  They felt pretty severe so I went to the cardiac Dr had many tests and nothing was found..the skipping stopped as soon as I began the Ativan.  So now I take 2 mg to 1 mg every day.  This will stop your panic attacks..I found nothing else that did the job.

Withdrawl is TERRIBLE.,DO NOT take this medication. I am one who researches on every medication there is and I ignored when everyone said this was a bad drug and only looked for the good in it. I should of had listened! Sure_ its fine if you take it once a week but if youre someone who needs somthing everyday to function with work_school people..remember its only temporary until you feel like your life is ran by this medication. Its highly addictive and you tend to feel like you cant function without it. Im on day 3 of tapering off it_ 1/2 a pill of 0.5mg and its been HORRIBLE. I just had a major panic attack and thought my paintings and statues with faces were going to come alive. I became scared of them and took everything down. Withdrawl comes with everything you see on Ativan websites. Im trying very hard _ if anything this medication gives you more anxiety on the fact that you cant function without it and are scared that once it wears off youre going to panic. DO. NOT. TAKE . IT. By the way_ if your psychiatrist says you can take this medication for the rest of your life...GET A NEW PSYCHIATRIST. I should of had known_ I study psychology!

181, 4, Extreme anxiety and panic attacks,Tremors when getting off too quickly.  Spaciness when first taken. Dry mouth.,I started taking ativan when I had many terrible side effects from anti-depressants. I was very scared to take it at first_ but after the first dose_ I was convinced. After feeling terrible for months_ I took my first ativan and felt awesome. It did not make me too sleepy but just relaxed me extremely and put me in a good mood. Usually this is the effect that I get from it. I also keep it in my purse for panic attacks and take it to go to the dentist_ doctor_ etc. The only issue I think with this med is that you cannot take it too regularly or your body will become physically addicted. When I tried to get off it too quickly i would sometimes have the shakes very badly. If this happens_ you know that you need to ween yourself off of it.

184, 1, Went to ER for PVC's,Tachycardia_ Panic attacks_ Horrific thoughts_ Agoraphobia_ crawling out of skin_ severe weight loss.,For me this became the drug from hell.  What started out as a trip to the Dr's to deal with some harmless PVC's became a living nightmare. For some stupid reason instead of just letting me see a cardiologist to ease my mind he decided it was likely these premature ventricular contractions of the heart were caused by anxiety so he prescribed Ativan.  Within 24 hours I was experiencing a racing heart along with a feeling of doom and gloom.  In 48 hours I was experiencing horrible thoughts_ vertigo and claustrophobia. In three days time I had become so agoraphobic I was hiding in my home and had to call friends to drive me back to the E.R. because I couldn't even drive.  I felt like I could burst out of my skin.  When I explained to the Dr what was going on all he said was to stay calm and just take my new little med.  When I started researching this stuff on line I found that  for some they can have an odd adverse reaction and actually acquire all the symptoms it's suppose to fight against.  I told the Dr this and he said stop looking on the internet and just keeping taking the med.  He could see my heart was racing at 132 resting and did nothing.  So for an entire month I begged for help.  By then I had lost 35 lbs.  I looked like I was dying and felt like I was dying and had begun making out my will.  I was scared to death to give it a try but I weened myself off breaking it down a 1/4 of a tab every three days.

Being on the drug was not a problem for me_ coming off of it was and I only had TWO 1mg in 2 week period_ two 1mg doses which even still a year later is messing with me as far as side effects go. I went to the ER for anxiety_ a near panic attack because of a traumatic event. The ER doctor gave ativan_ it felt great. A few days later the ativan started to wear off and I woke up in the night covered in sweat as if I had been swimming in a pool_ was shaking_ dizzy_ paranoid_ scared and felt insane_ like nothing I had ever experienced. IF you experience this I suggest soaking your feet in warm water to calm down_ rub them and maybe eat some chocolate (It helped me_ it sounds silly but TRY IT) I was rushed to the ER again and they gave me 1mg ativan. I was then evaluated by a shrink at the ER and diagnosed with generalized anxiety (WHICH IS ABSURD!) I have never had anxiety panic attacks before this and now I have random panic attacks all the time which are gradually tapering down as I am recovering from Ativan. Coming off Ativan is hell_ literally hell! being on it is heavenly and what goes up must come down. I suggest not taking this unless it is a medical emergency and you are panicking beyond reason to start with. The withdrawal effects of this drug aren't worth it.

I love being able to take .5 to 1mg Ativan before bed_ sleep well all night_ and wake up refreshed.  For my occasional PTSD type symptoms(self diagnosed)this helps me be calm and helps me put out the sudden fire of thoughts.  I am going off caffeine_ don't drink alcohol_ and will stop late night dining to see if I can sleep without Ativan because I have been taking it more regularly this month. I don't want to depend on any medication that becomes addictive and my Dr advised me to be aware of this possibility.  However Ativan works and I will continue to take .5 to 1 mg when necessary.  I prefer a regime of good nutrition_ herbs_ teas_ and yoga but since perimenopause/menopause I have needed more help for sleep and anxiety.

197, 4, panic attacks,Forgetfulness_ sleep hangover,Bottom Line: Ativan has few side effects when taken in smaller doses and if taken WITHOUT other drugs or booze. It has allowed many of us to live a 'normal' life. Of course it's addictive_ hello..? When you are truly ready to stop this drug always get help and do not attempt to do it alone. You must wean off very slowly_ literally chipping away at the pills until all you take is a crumb. I was taught this by a very good psychiatrist. Panic is a very real and physical condition that can tear your life apart. Taking this drug is no different than taking insulin for diabetes. My advice_ stay under 4 mgs. daily_ preferably 2-3 mgs. and you should be fine. I hear all this hoopla about how scary ativan is_ etc. But many of the people who say this are also drinking or taking other drugs. If the drug doesn't click with you stop taking it but Don't tell others they need to stop too. God Bless and may He give you the Peace you deserve.,F,57,14  years1 mg 3X D,2/13/2011,Ativan

He saw green bottles on the ceiling_ a little child that wasn't there and became aggresive with family members and nursing staff.  If the medical staff had done their job and continued his regular daily medications_ they never would have needed to give him Ativan.

Very calming (for me) and I was able to sleep well at first.,"I took extra pills on a couple of high stress days and ran out. I was not able to get a refill for four days. On day two I had the first panic attack I've had in over 30 years. I felt incredibly terrible and didn't understand why. It suddenly occurred to me that I was hooked on this drug. I also realized that the ""passing out"" event I thought was brought on by a stressful event a month previously was in fact a seizure caused by not taking Ativan for a number of days. My legs were cramping. My face and neck were cramping and contorted and I was sweating profusely. I was taken by squad to hospital and was treated as a cardiac patient. ALL normal test results. After I was given Ativan I felt fine. All of this is just coming together for me as I reflect on events of the past few months. I'm off the drug now (5 days cold turkey) but this is very difficult. Lots of anxiety_ brain fog_ trembling and I can't sleep at all. I like many others I've read on this site WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS DRUG!!!! Very addictive and in my mind dangerous.

200, 4, anxiety,Moderate drowsiness.,I have to laugh when I read some of the reviews from people on here who clearly were prescribed this drug for anxiety - they took it once or twice or for only a couple days and then post a horrible_ scary rating. You have to give it a chance - when I first started taking it_ I was half out of my mind with anxiety_ unable to cope at all! The first few days_ I didn't like it at all. But now it is a wonder drug for me and made it possible for me to function and get through my anxiety episodes and panic attacks. Yes_ it makes you drowsy (it's a sedative) and yes it makes you not as anxious which in itself can be alarming at first - we're used to panicking!  It's a strong drug so start out with .25 and work up to what feels comfortable. But don't pan the drug if you've only taken it once or twice - unless you had an allergic reaction or became homicidal!!!,F,36,3  years1 4X W,1/13/2011,Ativan

My advice to someone who just started using this drug: start with a very low dose_ don't increase it unless you absolutely need to_ and try not to take it every day. My doctor started me on a high dose_ told me to take it everyday_ and I became addicted. There's nothing wrong with being addicted to this particular drug_ but it's a lot easier if you're not.

222, 5, insomnia/anxiety,somnolence_ drowsy,Okay.....here's the bottom line: Ativan (lorazepam) is a great drug if you're someone who isn't cursed with an addictive personality or substance abuse issues. I was prescribed Ativan (15 1 mg pills) after experiencing insomnia and anxiety because of work and family related matters_ and it worked like a charm! My doc. prescribed some more back in 2007 after my anxiety and stress flared up again. If you treat this drug with respect and only use it a couple of times a month you'll uncover that this is indeed a miracle drug since it will restore peace of mind during situations when racing thoughts and anxiety have hijacked your thought pattern. It works wonders right before bedtime when your mind refuses to relax.,M,45,3  weeks1mg 1X AN,10/9/2010,Ativan
223, 5, anxiety,very mild sleepiness-drugged feeling,A wonder drug for the anxious person like myself. My profession would not be possible without it-I panic when I have to chair controversial meetings. But if i dose beforehand with Ativan I am in command and I end up looking cool-calm and very professional. The right dose for me is about 3/4 of a 1 mg tab 3 hours prior to the meeting-1 mg and i'm a little too drugged and 1/2 mg is just not quite enough. Many years of experimentation have led me to these conclusions. Another thing it is good for is sleeping on nights when you have a lot of stressful stuff going on and you want to be rested because the anticipatation disrupts your sleep-also useful for major events in life that create a lot of anxiety.The key for me has been to NOT take this drug everyday and so I have never become addicted to it-weeks may go by when i don't need it but when a big meeting comes up or some other very stressful event I have my little white pill which chokes off the part of the brain that gets all worked up over these things and the real me-the personality shines through and I'll say it again-I OWE MY SUCCESSFUL CAREER PROFESSION TO THIS DRUG I'd probably would have had to quit long ago without it.,M,57,25  years 1X AN,10/2/2010,Ativan

228, 5, Insomnia_ Restless Leg Syndrome,None,I love this pill. I always had trouble sleeping. Not only would I 'turn myself around' but I would sometimes get no sleep once I was too turned. I was originally prescribed this for anxiety and immediately noticed how great it was for sleeping. It is stupendous for sleeping. It helps me get to sleep and I don't wake up with any groggy feeling or side effects. I have never had a problem with needing a higher does_ and .5 DOES work_ like clockwork_ every night. Plus it is wonderful to have on hand for the occasional anxious day. My mom had real trouble with Ambian and Lunesta - why take those when this is available. The only problem with this pill is getting it. I don't know why but all doctors are hysterical about it and my pharmacy is too.

Severe Headaches when not taken every day_ tingling sensations_ light headed_ dizziness,I really loved how well this drug immediately cured my anxiety when I was first prescribed to it.  Then I started getting use to the feeling of calmness all of the time.  Pretty soon just .5mg wasn't enough for me.  I took it when I woke up_ during the day_ and even before bed to help me stay asleep better.  This drug works great_ but after a while I felt I was getting dependent on it.  I tried to stop taking it_ but I needed good sleep while I was in school full time.  On spring break I attempted to ween myself off of it_ but I got TERRIBLE mood swings.  I was angry all the time_ and I thought I could feel my blood flowing through my veins.  The withdrawal feeling was similar if not worse than quitting smoking.  I felt physically sick if I didn't take the Ativan daily.  This is a highly addictive drug that gave me many unwanted side effects.  Even 5 months after being off of the drug_ I still keep the left overs stashed around just in case.  It's like my security blanket.  I continue to have blurred vision since I stopped taking this medicine_(which is why I don't take it anymore) and I feel like I have nervous twitches now that I didn't have before taking this med.  I would strongly suggest anyone who is sensitive to medicine_ to skip this stuff all together!

In fact I have thought that until last year when I learned it is a cause of cognitive impairment...a slowing of mental function. There I was_ building my career_ when things starting going downhill. I began to notice I couldn't concentrate and couldn't perform at work so well anymore. Then I started getting negative feedback at work. My performance reviews were about some other person I did not recognize. My personality changed. I became emotional at every little thing. I took things personally. I got paranoid. My stress increased_ my blood pressure went up. I gained weight. I felt sick all the time. I finally had to quit my job...in shame...and have since lost my home_ my income_ even my ability to carry on an intelligent conversation about things on which I used to be an expert. This drug has destroyed my life. I am currently using cannabis (strong indica_ which is relaxing) to help me relax so I can sleep. My plan is to get to where I,"When I expressed my concerns to my DOCTOR about my ""addiction"" to ativan_ he seemed unconcerned and told me it was safe.

I felt funny in my neck area starting in January 2004_ 6 months prior to full blown Dystonia. I ended up in Emergency where I was diagnosed by a Neurologist who had me doing various tests to get more data. I wasn't able to see a Neurologist who specialized in Movement Disorders for awhile so while I waited_ my family Doc. prescribed me Flexeril (20mg 3x/day)& Ativan (2mg 3x/day). I was on Ativan for 6 years @ that dosage. Last year I managed to cycle that down to 1mg 3x/day & recently I've lowered it again to .5mg/.5mg/1mg per day. I must say I can't believe the difference. It's like coming out of a fog. The withdrawls have quite a few of the same side effects of Ativan_ but I have some withdrawls that are worse. Like abdomen dystension_ I look pregnant!! It's horrible.

I was informed I should not drive home_ but not informed of the impairment I would suffer for nearly 24 hours after taking it.

I apparently decided to take a bath_ fell in the tub and my husband came home to find me this way.  We had no idea that I'd respond so severely to the effects.  What could have stopped me from getting my car keys and driving to the store?  I'm sure if it had crossed my impaired mind_ I would have done so.  Scary!

240, 1, Anxiety,Ativan is one of the most problematic benzodiazepines. I became addicted in 1975 and could not discontinue due to the horrific withdrawal symptoms. I finally managed to withdraw completely this year using a Diazepam taper as recommended in the Ashton manual. I have now been benzo free for 4 months and feel 100% better but still have many withdrawal symptoms some of which I believe may last longer than I anticipated. I now campaign in the UK in order to help others addicted to benzodiazepines.,Ativan_ made initially by John Wyeth and Brother Ltd_ is one of the most addictive benzos and has been shown to cause epileptic seizures on withdrawal from therapeutic doses after as little as 3 weeks ingestion. It has also been shown to cause up to 200 side effects and withdrawal symptoms. If you are on it then look up the Ashton manual online for advice and information regarding discontinuation.,M,55,35  years1mg 1X D,7/1/2010,Ativan

I have been a hospital nurse for many years and am aware of the uses for ativan.  It is usually meant for short term use and in controlled setting_ and NOT for the elderly!  I have been trying for years to get him off.  Last year he began to fall quite a bit and I worked with a pharmacist friend to wean him down.  He had been taking 1 mg_ 4 to 5 times a day.  I had NO cooperation from his family doctor.  Not surprising.  My father was also not pleased_ but since at this point I was picking up and dispensing his meds and bringing them to his home_ he had no choice but to take what I gave.  He has now been in hospital for a week after another fall.  He can hardly walk and is extremely paranoid.  His doctor has now agreed to wean him off onto something else_ with my insistence_ and_ under recommendations from our pharamacist.

It did wonders for the shakes and anxiety.  It even helped me rest better.  For the most part I only take it at night before bed unless I have an attack during the day which is very rare.  I would sometimes even skip my dosage at night because I began taking ambien for insomnia.  Ive noticed if I go a few days without taking it I become extremely irritable (complete B****) and wake up with anxiety attacks.  I believe it has ruined my relationship...this weekend was horrible and I do believe that for the first time I realized that was I was going thru was withdrawals from not taking it for 3 days.  I almost came unglued last night...and for some reason now if I dont take it...the ambien doesnt work maybe because the anxiety is too much! I havent slept in two days...LITERALLY! And today Im a wreck at work...I refuse to take the medicine at this point because of how Im feeling...I dont like this...Ive never done drugs and this is much like what I assume drug attacks feel like once they go cold turkey!

I was previously on Xanax (2 mg 3X/day) and it stopped helping so my doctor switched me to Ativan and it has done wonders ever since.  It helped with the anxiety and allowed me to sleep better at night.  I did not experience too many side effects...just sleepiness and occasional lack of concentration.  I recently decided that I do not want to take it anymore because my husband and I would like to have a baby in the near future.  I decided to wean myself off of ativan 3 weeks ago.  I started by taking just 1 mg/day for the first week_ then dropped to .5 mg/day for 3 days_ then down to .25 mg 1X/day and then .25 every 2 days.  I stopped one week ago.  I went to my dr. because I was worried about the withdrawal symptoms.  He put me on Celexa (10 mg 2-3X/day).  The first few days I felt very anxious_ very sensitive to noises and light_ weakness_ insomnia_ heart palpitations_ shakiness and restless legs.  I am on day 7 and much of this has gone away.  The Celexa has helped quite a bit. Overall it really wasn't that bad.  I feel so much better now.  I have more energy during the day and feel good overall. After reading other peoples' comments_ I thought that sharing my experience would help others who are trying to stop taking it to be encouraged vs. deterred by the bad experiences.

Maybe it's b/c it lasts only a few hours and on some days I felt the need to take 2 or 3 when I was only supposed to be taking it for sleep at night. I got to the point where I could not function without it. Quit cold turkey and felt horrible and in pain for a week. Did not sleep for 1 week_ so my doc prescribed Klonopin_ which works MUCH better for me. It's stronger and lasts longer. I do not feel ""addicted"" to Klonopin like I did Ativan and I can still take a little bit during the day if I need it and function OK.",F,26,4  months0.5 mg 2X D,4/6/2010,Ativan
253, 4, anxiety,slow reaction time while driving,"This has worked really well for me when I became very anxious during my mom's illness and having to move her to a long term care facility. I'm very cautious_ only take half a pill as needed_ which is now once a week or less. If I can't get to sleep_ or wake up too early_ the half a pill is good for about 3-4 hours sleep. I've experienced unexpected benefits_ such as less shyness_ ability to urinate in a public restroom_ improvement in foreign language fluency_ and more social confidence in general. It made me realize I'd been experiencing a certain constant level of anxiety my whole life. I wish I could take it all the time but don't dare to_ just when I need a little ""vacation.""",M,47,1.5  years 1X AN,4/5/2010,Ativan

257, 1, anxiety,Completely screwed up my body.  Brain fog_ achy joints_ nausea_ loss of weight_ lack of sleep_ heart palpitations.  This drug did not act as a sedative for me_ it did the opposite.,This drug is extremely dangerous. After starting ativan i came down with my stated side effects.  Never been sick in 57 years.  When I tried to stop taking ativan_ it triggered physical side effects (just like an illegal street drug user would have - fever_ tingling sensations_ mind fog_ sweating_ muscle cramps).  The first attempt to get off this drug_ I justed stop taking it.  3 days later withdrawal symptoms triggered.  On second attempt_ i took 1 week to come off dosage.  4 days later i had major withdrawal symptoms.  My body had become physically addicted to this drug.  I never took any drugs my whole life even though i used less than 90 days and took only .75 mg a day.  At this point in time_ i did research on the Internet. The sites clearly showed how addictive Ativan is.  My doctor didn't emphasize this addictiveness.  The sites pointed towards changing diet to a Mediterranean diet and adding supplements to help ease the withdrawal symptoms.  After starting these changes_ i called a psychiatrist_ (doctor dealing with drug addiction).  She told me to wean off the drug over 4 weeks with each week taking 25% less dosage.  I did as she said and was able to come of the drug cleanly.  She told me she had clients who took up to a year to get off of some of these prescription anxiety drugs.  Moral of the story_ if at any time one gets side effects from prescription drugs_ stop taking it.  I never gave it a thought that one could get sick after stopping taking a drug!!!,M,57,90  days.75 mg 1X D,3/25/2010,Ativan

260, 4, Severe Anxiety & tension state,No adverse effects,After 3 years of having Ativan keep the anxiety & aggression in check_ doc office staff decided I was using it too much and cut me off. Doc told me if I need it more than 3 times a week he wants me on Paxil...HUH?  I never abused it_ I never sought it from other doctors. Without warning_ without a call to discuss it-he cut me off. The aggression and anxiety have returned with a vengeance. The verbal fights with family & loved ones has torn relations apart and cost me a couple of friendships. Why did this ASS &*^E do this to me? I had 3 good years on it_ now he ripped it out from under me. I am pretty much non-functional now. VERY short temper_ very destructive. I went to this doc for help & he's made me more of a mess than when I started out. DO NOT let a GP give you benzos-they don't know what they're doing & it's not pleasant when they say NO MORE with no warning. A psychiatrist should be the ONLY one with the authority to prescribe these. I was honest_ I was responsible and I got kicked in the teeth for it. Now I need to find a psychiatrist to put me back on it and I'm scared to death I'm going to be made to suffer. Why would they withhold a med that allowed you to be functional?

This drug destroyed my life and my family.  If you have a script for it BE AWARE THAT TWO WEEKS OF CONTINUOUS USE IS ENOUGH TO CAUSE AN ADDICTION THAT IS HARDER TO TREAT THAN HEROINE ADDICTION.  BE AWARE THAT THIS DRUG CAN RENDER YOU SENSITIVE TO A WHOLE SPECTRUM OF MEDICATIONS_ AND FOR SOME EVEN SUPPLEMENTS AND FOODS LIKE SUGAR AND CAFFEINE.  BE AWARE THAT SOME PEOPLE SUFFER PERMANENT EFFECTS FROM USE/WITHDRAWAL OVER AN ABOVE THEIR ORIGINAL PROBLEM; THIS INCLUDES PERMANENT MOVEMENT DISORDERS LIKE TARDIVE DYSKINESIA AND AKATHISIA.  BE AWARE THAT MOST DOCTORS WILL NOT RECOGNIZE THE EXTENT OF THE INJURIES THESE DRUGS CAN CAUSE SO BE PREPARED TO DO YOUR OWN MEDICAL RESEARCH IF YOU BECOME DISABLED BY THIS DRUG.  ALSO BE PREPARED TO BE INVALIDATED BY FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHEN YOU TRY TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE DRUG HAS DONE TO YOU.

265, 4, anxiety and panic atacks,I have only taken a few. 0.5 is my prescribed dosage. I was told if i felt a bad panic attack coming on to take it then.   I have always been afraid to take anything_ even after my surgeries i put up with the pain.  I just never liked the feeling of being doped up. this so far just made me feel relaxed.   I read a lot of posts about medicines and the most confusing thing to me is_ if you have such bad experiences with a drug_ why do you continue to take it 8_ 10 _12 years?  there is something definitely wrong somewhere if your doctor continues you on it or you would listen to a doctor who would leave you on a med_ that caused that much trouble for you.  makes no sense whatsoever.  I have been tried on several anxiety medicines and some helped for a while_ boy I called right away when I started to feel not right and told my doctor _ I can't take this medicine because it does this and this to me.  she said ok I dont want you to feel like this_ we will try something else until we find one,I am not planning on taking this everyday_ like some post I read. I take lexapro and it helps with the general anxiety so far.

They worked great at first_ but tolerence developed and they became less effective.  I decided to take a break and 4 days later I had severe shortness of breath while at rest out of the blue! I thought I was having an asthma attack and was going to die! I started having really hellish thoughts/visions at night that caused extreme anxiety and the feeling of being shocked.  I took 1 mg of ativan _ and I felt better after an hour or two.  Started a Valium taper (ashton method) the next day.  I am down 20% after 5 weeks and it is rough_ but I am feeling better and am very hopeful I can recover from these evil benzos. I have some minor anxiety as I taper but I stablize after a few days and move down my dose again.  Slow and steady wins the race! Ativan is a medicine from hell for long term use.

I read a post where 1 person said she was allergic 2 valium & was given ativan instead & had an allergic reaction 2 that bc they r in the same family. But_ guess what? I'm allergic 2 klonopin & take Ativan. The begging & pleading of people on here 2 get people 2 not try a med is pathetic & can be detrimental 2 1's health. Ur Dr obviously thinks a certain drug will work & outweighs the benefits & risks. Yes some may have side effects but_ u have 2 try it 2 know. This med is EXTREMELY safe_ save 4 the ones allergic 2 it. Overdosage is almost impossible & hospitals use it 4 just about EVERYTHING. Trust me I know. I'm a Med student. One KID got over 100mg & was fine. It calms U down however_ it has no effect directly on ur cardiovascular or respitory systems. And it DOES stop racing thoughts. After 5 years of SEVERE panic attacks 2 the point of calling an ambulance twice a day EVERY day_ it is the ONLY drug that does that. Ativan is a miracle drug. Shame on any1 who tries 2 deter u from help. If u can't take it fine...Move on 2 something else...Don't scare people off of meds. U r NOT a DR & know nothing about any1 else or their medical history.U just have 2 keep trying different meds 2 find out which 1 is 4 u & the 1s that r not 4 U doesn't mean they r not 4 some1 else,F,29,5  years,10/3/2009Email,Ativan

I didn't see any way to recover and ended up a mess at the doctors. He prescribed ativan and the relief was instant. Trouble was i continued using them daily for 6 months or so and realised that i had indeed become addicted to them_ and found myself craving them. I became quite worried at this point and stopped them cold turkey. That hurt...big time! but i felt genuinely proud that i was able to kick them. Since then i have always carried a few with me and take them only when necessary (flying for instance)They make me feel wonderfully calm and relaxed_ but i am careful not to take them for any longer than 2 weeks at a time.

My fiance was on 12mg a day of Ativan upon being released from hosptial. I dont know what dose the hospital had him on while in for 14 days in a drug induced coma. After coming home_ 3 weeks later he killed our infant daughter. Anyone have any knowledge about loss of temper after stopping cold turkey_ off 12 mg a day.

313, 5, Panic Attacks,Forgetfulness on occasion.  Drowsy sometimes. Can sometimes be irritable a day after not taking it_ but that subsides quickly for me.,Tried Xanax and Paxil. Xanax worked sometimes and Paxil made me very irritable. Ativan works great for my minor to major panic attacks. It has been a life saver for me.  Works fast_ I'd say my panic attack will subside within 30 minutes to an hour depending on the severity after taking my low dose of .5mg. If I have a minor panic attack (throat closing up_ chest tight) I split my .5mg pill in half and it does the trick for me. If I have a full out major panic attack (trembling_ heart rate goes way up_ hot/cold flashes_ sweating_ etc.) one .5mg pill does the trick for me. This drug has prevented me going to the ER all the time. What  a relief! Panic is no fun! This drug also helps me sleep. Be careful_ it can become addictive I am told. I got a very low dose and I ususally snap it in half and that works fine. So most of the time I am taking only .25mg on any given day. I also only take it when I need it so a 30 day supply ususally lasts me about 3 months.,M,38,12  months,3/5/2009,Ativan

I was assured it was not addictive! This was in the 70s.I do get withdrawal effects if I don't take it but I have never had any need to increase the dose from the minimum of I mg daily. My doctors have agreed to leave me on it. Sometimes I get really stressed and knowing that relief will come when I take that pill at about 5.30 is what gets me through.

Other evenings_ 0.5mg_ and I'm literally unable to stand up straight going to the washroom.,I only use Ativan for sleep now_ as its basically the lowest strength sleeping medication available in the 0.5mg tablets that has a half-life sufficient to give me 6-8 hours of good sleep without impairing me the next day.  Other hypnotics are considerably stronger (in benzodiazepine equivilance) in their available dose formats_ or have very long half-lives (ie: diazepam_ flunitrazepam_ nitrazepam).  I need my mind to be 100% during the day_ and Ativan is the only sleep aid that can accomplish this.Very happy with the results_ and I haven't required any dose escalation whatsoever.  This stuff works just as well today_ using it practically every night_ as it did the first day I used it.  As with alcohol_ tolerance seems to be related to higher doses.,M,29,3  months,2/26/2009,Ativan

The Ativan was great at making the whole time a bit easier to deal. I was mostly just taking .5MG as needed and 1MG at bedtime. It was hard to stop taking it because I enjoyed the way it made me feel and I had become dependent on it to sleep_ but I don't think I really had any withdrawal symptoms. I tapered down to .5MG before bed for a few days & then stopped. I still use occassionally as needed (I get Remicade infusions & take .5MG for anxiety before my infusion). I will say_ however_ that you should NEVER drink with this medication_ it is just totally irresponsible and I was very ashamed of myself for having done such a stupid thing and I'm very lucky nothing bad happened to me.,F,30,5  months,2/25/2009,Ativan

329, 4, Anxiety / Social anxiety Depression,I'm not sure I've had any real side effects.,I started taking this medication during a battery of ECT as for some reason they didn't want me taking Xanax which I had been on for the same reasons previously.  I started with .5mg of Ativan and I think I could have eaten tic-tacks and gotten as much benefit from them.  I went up to 1mg while still doing ECT and this didn't do a whole lot for me.  After finishing up ECT I went back to my normal doctor and he sortof laughed that the doctors at the ECT hospital had me on such a low dose of Ativan.  I had previous to ECT been on 2-4mg of xanax as needed typically 2 times a day.  Now I am on a dose that seems to work for me of the ativan 2mg 1-2times a day.  I think people need to look at the therapeutic dose of the medication for themselves and not worry about the addiction.

Will probably always need some type of medicine for anxiety back up_ but DO NOT take this medication every day. YOU WILL GET ADDICTED AND WITHDRAWAL IS HORRIBLE!  I HOPE to get off of this medicine and only take maybe diazepam or maybe .25 mg of ativan only in specific situations of panic/anxiety_ but not regularly.

More recently started taking 0.5 mg at night prior to bed off and on for about 2 months for insomnia with no notable side effects.  Started taking more frequently in Sept_ and moved up to taking 1mg during day and 0.5 mg at night. Took about 2 weeks to realize I was getting hooked. Started having very high levels of anxiety when I did NOT take it. Stopped taking it completely and had about the worst week ever with horrible depression and what I think was probably borderline panic state. This absolutely was the scariest thing I have ever experienced and there is no way I would take this stuff again.,M,54,2  months,10/23/2008,Ativan
348, 4, Panic Disorder,Euphoria; occasional disconnected feeling; blackouts; clumsiness.,Ativan helped me a great deal when I was first diagnosed with panic disorder_ a little over a year ago. It worked very quickly and effectively_ and I took 1.5 mg/day for the first month until my SSRI (Lexapro) started to kick in. I later lowered the dosage to 2x/day_ but often took less. I eventually switched to Klonopin_ but after several attempts to wean myself off I'm still taking about .5 mg/day (=1mg Ativan) 6 months later. I plan to switch to Valium soon so I can cut my dose further. A great drug but be careful_ it is habit-forming and physically addictive.,M,20,7  months,10/22/2008,Ativan
349, 4, OCD_ GAD_ PTSD,None_ except additcion.,First_ my history: I was diagnosed with anxiety disorders in 1990. I was given the usual SSRIs but had to come off of them because I couldn't tolerate the side effects. I was given Valium 1mg as needed for the next fifteen years or so. Didn't work very well. Finally the anxiety got so bad my doc put me on Xanax 1mg twice a day. Worked great until I had another episode of anxiety and was hospitalized. Was put on 2mg Ativan 7 times a day. Quickly reduced that to 2mg once a day with the same effect. Problem is_ I was still taking the Xanax. So right now I'm taking 2mg Ativan during the day_ and 1mg Xanax at dinner. Trying to stop the Ativan and was okay until another bout of anxiety hit. So here I am at 2mg Ativan and 1mg Xanax per day. That is drug abuse (neither of my docs know about it) but it happened by accident and I know I'm addicted. Okay_ the good part: they work! Well_ except for the most severe of anxiety episodes. But Ativan seems to even me out for the day_ then Xanax takes m,M,51,2  months,10/19/2008,Ativan
350, 1, For insomnia,This did not help my insomnia at all.   I started out at .5mg and ended up building a tolerance to it.  It is very physically addictive.   I went from .5mg to 2.5mg in a period of a few months.  Even at the higher dose_ it did nothing to help my insomnia.  Withdrawal was not easy_ even on a gradual taper_ since it has a very short half life.  I had severe stomach cramps_ ringing in the ears_ and night sweats as the taper progressed downward.  I've been off Ativan for 7 weeks now and am still having tinnitus and night sweats.  Be aware that it should only be taken short term for sleep disorders.  Apparently my doctor wasn't aware of that.  I've found Valium to be much more effective_ and the long half life makes it easier to taper off.,I wouldn't take this drug again.,F,,4  months,10/17/2008,Ativan
351, 5, severe anxiety,only occasional sweating and flushing,I was taking .5 mgs. twice a day_ and then recently my 25 year old brother died and dr. said I could take three a day. This drug has allowed me to calm myself and focus.  During grief it has allowed me to not cry continually.  When I am feeling more in control_ I do not take all doses_ or skip it all together.  I have no problems with this_ and suffer no addictive or withdrawal problem. I do take this in conjuction with Effexor.,F,37,6  months,10/8/2008,Ativan

Within 20 minutes_ I am less anxious and whatever was getting me all keyed up seems less intense and more manageable. The only problem is that over time_ this medication begins to lose some of its effects and you have to increase your dose. So I keep it as a ""fallback drug"" - only to be used when the regular meds aren't working so I don't have to become increasingly dependent upon it.

I constantly felt bad/guilty about things that I really had no control over. I would continually try to think of how I could ""fix"" things. I believe this medication calms my mind down and helps me to realize that there are things that I can help fix in life and some things I just have to either let go of or accept the way things are at this time. Because my anxiety has been cut by atleast 75%_ I now can say to myself_ ""things will be o.k. and will all work out in the end.

After beginning to experince agitation shortly therafter this visit_ Nurses administered Ativan_which fully sedated him for the next 4 days_ when he then passed away. If You wish to have family members see/talk to your parent/loved one before they die_ you may wish to ask Doctor's or Hospice for some other med_ temporarily.

I've been taking 0.25 to 0.5 mg 1-2 times per week_ before bed ONLY_ if I'm too anxious to sleep. Before this drug_ I had terrible bouts of insomnia that would leave me unable to function or go to work. Something would stress me out_ causing intense anxiety_ and then I wouldn't sleep. Then I'd start worrying about not sleeping_ and this vicious cycle of anxiety/insomnia would get a hold on me. It was ruining my life! Thanks to ativan_ I don't have to worry about anxiety affecting my sleep anymore_ so I've stopped obsessing about it. If I am too anxious to sleep_ I know I can take a pill...and just knowing I can take ativan makes me relax enough to sleep (so I often don't even need to take it). This drug has developed a terrible reputation because many people don't use it RESPONSIBLY. They take too high a dose and use it too often.

I do not feel like I am going to die although I am still very nervous with lots of tingeing sensations_ my mind is still wondering.

394, 5, Migraines,"It worked GREAT_ immediately and I didn't feel ""doped up"" at all. It got rid of the migraine and I could even work! Take only PRN.",My doctor prescribed this when long-term migraines didn't respond to Imitrex. Of course_ I only take as needed and only if the Imitrex doesn't work first. Benzodiazepines are too easily addictive.,F,40,1  days,3/14/2008,Ativan
395, 3, Anxiety,Relieves temporary anxiety.  Has a numbing effect.  like drinking a couple beers without the down.  Xanax is a similar drug but gives you a high.  Don't take with alcohol_ you'll black out and/or vomit.  Pro: reduces anxiety_ Con: addictive_ lasting effects.,I started taking ativan/lorazapam(generic) at 19 yrs old.  I was in college and experiencing anxiety.  Took small doses (0.5mg) on and off for several years.  Good part is that it'll get thru that nerve wrecking ordeal.  You still have to get rid of the underlying issue.  Im no longer on ativan_ but I still get anxiety.  This pill is addictive.  After I stopped_ my body twitches at times.  I also have jaw/ear problems.  Neck strains.  Recommend being weened off.,F,27,2  years,3/11/2008,Ativan

I thought maybe the effects of tiredness would wear off but it didn't.Since I switched to Xanax which acted a lot better for me without the side effects of Ativan.,"Activan is sometimes used before dental extractions also other than anxiety. I would say it's not has powerful as Xanax but close. And of course that big word that's used quite a bit on this forum...ADDICTING! Most benzos are addicting but ""SO WHAT!""If they help you and you follow your doctor's recommended dosage_ I could care less about that big over ""Abused"" word ""Addiction."" If any thing is addicting it's the over used word...""ADDICTION!"" Dicipline yourself with these medications and you'll find yourself that these medications will indeed help you with your health issues. For me Ativan just didn't work for me. Xanax works much better for me.

I was warned about it by a physician friend_ but didn't realize how strong it was.  I immediately quit it after treatment_ and have experienced horrible side effects worse than what the drug is supposed to treat_ nausea_ dizzyness_ almost blacking out_ shortness of breath_ etc.  I had to ween myself off it UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A PHYSICIAN!

403, 3, convulsions_ and anxiety attacks,I took this drug when I was 17. Hyperactivity_ psychosis/mania_ no need for sleep were the side effects. Took 2mg at the onset of heavy twitching_ then it would kick in an hour later. Some days I would take 6mg_ others I would keep it down to 4mg depending if it was a good day or a bad one.,This medication worked to control my convultions due to an adverse drug reaction and controled my anxiety attacks_ however the side effects included me speaking at a million miles an hour_ producing a language that no one understood_ HYPERACTIVITY_ and not needing sleep. The drug was an amazing fix_ but it caused me to loose lots of weight from me running around and not needing sleep. No one understood what I would say_ and my thoughts would go at a million miles and hour. I could not perform simple addition_ nor sit still. I was taken out of school while I was on the drug becuase of my inability to perform. My choice was to be a maniac on Ativan or stay with the convultions. I chose Ativan_ but it was just a temporary fix. When i got off of Ativan I went crazy with the withdrawal symptoms_ but thank God I was able to go through that hell in one piece.

If I had the chance to do it over again knowing the outcome_ I'd take a bullet before using this medication. In times of need the use of ""Calms Forte"" made by Hylands which is not addictive and non-prescription seems to work. I used the non-addictive prescription drug ""Vistaril"" to help overcome the addiction to ativan.

I'm still suffering from the anxiety and will most likely have to increase the dosage.  I do grind my teeth at night_ but I solved this problem by using a sport's mouth guard (99 cents at Wal-Mart).

When all other medications failed_ this one was the miracle worker for my anxiety. 1 mg twice daily (if even needed twice a day_ sometimes not necessary) is working wonders for me.

Eventually the Dr's took pity and put me on Klonopin. I felt relaxed but I was not functioning at 100%. Eventually I quitKlonopin and went back to Ativan. I was never 100% on this drug and got hurt at work twice in one day. Now I have no job. Youcan't tell people about your psyche meds because of the stigmatism related to such a revalation. I remain addicted to Benzo's without any hope of  not using again. What the hell do I do now?

Withdrawal effects: periods of catatonia_ sometimes combined with muscle spasms_ depression_ suicidal ideation.",In the short run_ Ativan probably saved my life. It works much more rapidly than antidepressants do_ and also counters some of the negative effects of antidepressants. However_ it is extremely difficult to get off this drug. And the longer you take Ativan_ the greater the risk of having adverse reactions to it. Find a professional who knows what he or she is doing to help you with the withdrawal process.  Educate yourself as much as possible about the side effects_ withdrawal effects_ and long-term effects of benzodiazepine use. Know that using this drug regularly for more than a year can cause permanent brain damage (both cognitive and psychiatric) even at prescribed doses. I agree with others: do not take this drug every day and do not take more than what your doctor prescribes.

442, 5, anxiety / depersonalization,Tired; drowsy; slightly depressed,I was prescribed Lorazepam(Ativan) in 2003 during a period of intense anxiety and insomnia; in 2005 when I ruptured my Achilles tendon and was stressing out being in a cast for two months; beginning of 2007 due to work related stress. Every time the doctor wrote me a script I only took about four to ten pills (0.5 mg)during the course of six months and I only took them on an as need basis. I do not find this drug addictive at all but it's a wonder drug for removing those anxious / nervous butterflies in your stomach and it also work great as a sleep aid. This drug is a wonder drug IF you have a non-addictive personality and can take it on an as-need basis because all benzos are designed to work as temporary palliative measure.

443, 4, Sleep aid/panic attack,This medicine may cause tiredness in the morning_ diminished libido. Also_ one should not consume alcohol within 6-12 hours of a dose (depending on the dose_ amount of alcohol and individual response). Still_ it has relativelly minor side effects when compared to other drugs I had to take occasionally (propranolol/inderal for example_ which can also be used for some of these conditions - less effective for anxiety but less addictive also),This drug helped me go through difficult periods of stress_ when I was not able to sleep or had occasional panic attacks and dealing with anxiety before medical/dental procedures. The lowest dose (0.5 mg) would usually work for me_ but during particularly stressful periods I would take 1-2 mg/day.  Since it is very addicting_ one should learn to use the minimum effective dosage while doing everything else to improve their condition (i.e. lifestyle changes). Widhdrawal symptoms usually appear after 3-4 days and can last for weeks.,M,49,20  years,8/27/2007,Ativan

Haven't ever felt withdrawal symptoms_ but I only take a half pill at a time. Makes you sleepy_ but not too sleepy to work/drive. (and I figured better to be a little sleepy than completely stressed out and unable to concentrate!) Be careful with alcohol though. Didn't notice a problem when I had a glass of wine AFTER taking it a few hours earlier_ but felt VERY loopy when I had a glass of wine and THEN took a half pill.,F,27, ,8/20/2007,Ativan

447, 4, nausea caused by depression/anxiety,drowiness but manageable,I already take an antidepressant for depression_ however_ ativan  helps settle for stomach so I can eat.  Unlike many others_ I have not gained weight.  In fact_ I would lose weight if not for the ativan's calming effect.  I take 1mg at bedtime and sleep real well.  Before I couldn't go to sleep_ or if I did_ I would wake up every couple hours.  I depend on Ativan to help me eat_ sleep and try to live a normal life.,F,67,2  years,8/1/2007,Ativan
448, 4, anxiety,Slightly drowsey.,I was prescribed Ativan to take as necessary for periodic anxiety. There are warnings about alcohol intensifying the effect_ and after my first dose I had some wine the NEXT night (over 24 hours after taking 1 1mg Ativan) and it seemed that the effects of the wine were intesified greatly even then_ so be careful. I figured I'd be fine since I hadn't taken Ativan that day_ but from now on I'll stay away from any alcohol for a few days after taking Ativan. Other than that I have to say that when I was prescribed Ativan I was in a really bad spot of obsessive anxiety and the drug snapped me right out of it_ so I am happy to be back to normal so quickly.,M,35, ,7/21/2007,Ativan
449, 5, panic disorder,You can experience withdrawal symptoms and mistake them for a panic attack. Ativan does induce sleep.,Ativan is a god send. It stopped my panic attacks in their tracks when I first got them. Now I take Ativan as needed_ maybe 0.5 mg once per day_ if at all. Never take Ativan the day you intend to have a drink_ it puts you over the edge. You might be surprised but 0.5 mg of Ativan is very effective.,M,56,6  years,7/20/2007,Ativan

I started taking a 1mg dose twice a day 1 in morning and 1 before bed.  I tapered myself down to .5mg twice a day and then finally was able to get off it for about 3 months this year.  I just started taking it in .5mg doses again due to the anxiety and depression resurfacing after 10 years.  I dont know if its coming back because I got off the medicine or just that I am having a relapse but I have to honestly tell you that those years in between when I was taking it were the best years of my life.

It works every time_ it doesn't have many negative side effects for me (and I'm mister experience all side effects usually). However_ you have to be careful coming off of it as it doesn't like letting go. This is one seriously difficult drug to stop cold turkey.

I never felt addicted to this_ and did not take it to get a high_ or low_ or whatever. I titered myself off over a period of 2-3 weeks_ first cutting my dosage in half_ for a week to ten days_ then_ into quarters for around 3-4 days. I still have 30 pills left_ and no desire to take any. I will keep the pills for when I fly_ as I am terrified of flying. My dosage was 1mg 4 times a day. There were no withdrawl symptoms_ other than getting ""hot"" in more ways than one_ once in awhile. When taking this medication_ if I didn't take it on time_ I would feel the need to take it.

It didn't get rid of my panic symptoms (nausea_ sweating_ feeling faint_ etc...) while I was in class; it just made me feel out of it AND panicky at the same time. Not fun.

Turns out that after researching Ativan withdrawals_ it can cause panic and anxiety withdrawals_ which would resemble the actual panic attacks.

He gave me a prescription for Naprosyn (500 mg); one of the side effects is a racing heartbeat right after you take it. I took my first dose last night and got hit by the heartbeat_ whihc triggered an increaser in anxiety_ so I took an Ativan this morning and it calmed me right down. An added benefit is that it relaxes ou_ which should help me get over the TMJ a little faster. There is no shame in taking it as needed so you can function.

So start taking 3 per day again. This drug_ for me_ is highly addictive.,F,91,2  days,11/19/2006,Ativan
496, 4, anxiety/panic...agoraphobia,after several years_ I have noticed some memory loss_ but I have no idea if that is due to this drug or not.,prozac_ zoloft_ etc_ etc_ etc_ didnt' work...Ativan has always helped.  I've taken it for 8 years as needed and have not noticed any addictive traits.  After a few years I did change from .5 mg to 1 mg.  Tried it on a daily basis and it didn't seem to do anything_ but it's still great on an 'as needed' basis.,M,34,8  years,11/13/2006,Ativan
497, 5, GAD_ minor panic attacks_ OCD,Slight drowsiness at first. Went away after a few days.,This is a great drug if taken properly. I started out taking two .5 mg a day--one at night and one in the morning. Then I backed down to one during the mornining_ when my anxiety levels peak. Now I'm down to one two or three times a week. I'm also seeing a therapist to work out my anxiety issues. I think you must combine therapy with any anti-anxiety drug for a permanent cure. But I see nothing wrong with taking Ativan as needed_ even every day. Should diabetics feel bad becasue they need insulin every day? There is nothing wrong with wanting to feel normal. I hope my therapy lets me stop Ativan totally eventually_ but in the meantime its helping me get through the tough times--stops the racing thoughts and just chills me out without making me feel doped up.,M,46,1  months,11/9/2006,Ativan
498, 5, anxiety/ocd,Slight drowsiness,"I'm thinking maybe some people who dontl like Ativan had an ""allergic"" reaction. I took Serzone for about a week a few years ago and it casued all sorts of nasty side-effects--vivid nightmares_ feeling doped up during the day_ etc. I switiced to Ativan and no probelms. If you look at the Serzone section on this site_ you'll find a lot ""5"" ratings--people love it_ but it wasn't right for me. I just had a bad reaction to Serzone_ just as others may have ahd with Ativan. You have to find what works for you.",M,46,1  days,11/9/2006,Ativan

502, 5, anxiety and panic,Minor drowsoness,I have GAD and Ativan helps calm me down so I can get a grip. I usually take .5 mg in the morning_ maybe another .5 at night if necessary_ which is rare. I'm also seeing a psycologist to help get rid of underlying anxiety issues so I can stop the drug. But it has been a lifesaver through the bad times. So far_ no tolerance issues. I think its great as part of a larger drug/therapy treatment.,M,46,2  weeks,10/30/2006Email,Ativan

Am fine by noon of the next day.,I am allergic to aspirin (ASA)so Ativan is the only thing that helps stop or slow down my musle spasms when they flare.  Particularly when I get them in my chest plate.  I only take it when absolutely needed which translates to approximately 1 (.5mg) pill a month.  Sometimes 2 a month.,F,47,5  years,10/20/2006,Ativan
506, 3, anxiety/nervousness/sleeplessness,A little drowsy.  Roller-coaster ride at the end of a dose and prior to the next one.  Stopping it is pretty rough. Withdrawalsymptoms left me very tense and anxious and could not stop pacing.  Woke several times during the night wide awake and kept pacing.  Became tolerant (drug did not have as strong an effect as it did o\in the beginning) after just 2-3 weeks.  It is very addictive.  Because I tried to stop cold turkey and had to go back since I as very nervous without it.  Don't stop it cold turkey_ taper it.  I was taking it .5mg 3/day,This is a very dangerous drug to start on.,M,44,3  days,10/11/2006Email,Ativan

After going off terrible withdrawal symptoms (did not know to taper off) -- still ongoing 3-1/2 weeks later --(ringing in ears_ jerking movements_ insomnia_ painful breathing_ anxiety & panic attacks).  See www.benzo.org.uk for more details on this drug.,This drug is highly addictive.  Not worth the short-term benefit.  Do not take it beyond a couple of days_ if at all.,M,44,28  days,9/30/2006,Ativan

I could barel function_ drive etc and it just really takes the edge off. I amm seeing a psychiatrist nxt week to get on an anti-anxiety as i know i cant use ativans forever. If i could_ i def would.

510, 1, axiety caused Lamisil symtoms,I am currently tapering off Lorazepan generic for Ativan after being on it of 6 weeks. At first it was ok with no major side effects but in the last three weeks I developed tremors_ muscle spasm on right side of face_ neck_ back and legs. At first these tremors were infrequent_ 2 max_ now it is daily. Episodes 1st lasted .5 hour last episode was 2 days ago lasted. 1.5 hours. I also wonder if it has to do that I'm reducing the meds.,I took Ativan for dealing with axiety after taking Lamisil and causing side effects. Before taking these meds I had never taken anything except generic form of Xanax between Lamisil and Adivan to deal with Lamisil issue. I had to stop taking Xanax because I was becoming nauseated all the time_ along with tremors. Best advise is to see therapy_ support groups but NO Psychiatrist. They will want to put you on more meds.,F,41,6  weeks,9/25/2006Email,Ativan
511, 5, depression and severe panic attacks,When I first started taking Ativan_ the only side affect I experienced was getting drowsy. Now I don't have any side effects from it.,The drowsiness side effect only took place during the first few weeks of taking Ativan. From personal experience_ be careful about taking cough and cold medicines with Ativan_ because the side affects from the other medicines will be twice as bad. Or maybe that is just me... Anyways_ the anxiety_ depression_ and panic attacks_ are because I have a hard time dealing with my disabilty_ and perhaps partially because I have problems with my spinal cord. (Ankylosing Spondylitis with Osteoporosis_ and suspecting also Stenosis). I find Ativan to be a safe drug_ and non habit forming even if taken on a regular basis_ but it may be habit forming for other people. If I can always forget to take them_ that must mean that I am not addicted to them. I was first perscribed .5mg_ 3 times a day_ now I am pescribed 1mg_ 3 times a day. Ativan has kept me out of the emergency room from having severe panic attacks_ and it also keeps my AFIB-RVR heart condition in check. I think Ativan has been a life save,M,35,7  years,9/17/2006Email,Ativan
512, 5, Anxiety & related insomnia,None,Very helpful over short-term. Calms anxiety and helps sleep without feeling drugged. I took 1-2 mg./day for 3 months 10 years ago and had no problem stopping when issues were resolved and prescription ran out. Recently I was on 1-1.5/day for 4-5 months and tapered off after reading many of the withdrawal horror stories on the Internet. I would recommend using only as really needed_ not on a daily basis and working on the underlying problems with a therapist or other means. Tapering works...I tapered off over a period of a few weeks until I was down to .25 mg for sleep and then stopped completely with no side effects.,M,51,5  months,9/15/2006,Ativan

When I was on this medication I also had a recurring dream in which I was drinking a bottomless glass of water all night_ and I have known others this has happened to.,I have taken this intermittently since I was 17. I found that I needed a higher dose than indicated (7 mg or so) in order to combat anxiety. This drug is powerful and a godsend for people who suffer acute anxiety attacks_ but is dangerous because it's easy (and fun) to use recreationally. I've also taken a dose and then taken another dose either because the first hasn't kicked in yet_ or doesn't seem to be working. What I found most dangerous about this drug is that I don't feel high or aware that I'm altered or acting oddly. Do not drive while on this drug_ even if you feel safe doing so_ and taking other depressants can really zonk you out_ or kill you. In my experience_ taking way too much of this drug can result in extreme agitation_ panic_ hallucination (not the fun kind)_ depersonalization_ suicidal urges and almost violent extreme emotions and actions.,F,25,9  years,9/2/2006,Ativan

Knocked me out for 12 hours... then I continued taking it for 2 months before I realized that the symptoms (on the left) were from Ativan_ not HIV. Now I'm trying to taper off.

517, 4, Insomnia/anxiety/post migraine,After about three months of 1mg per night_ became quite forgetful. Cognitive abilities seemed to deteriorate the longer I was using. Also noticed occasional morning dizzy spells. After ten months decided to taper--tapered off over three months and the last month was HELL.,Wish doc had advised against using drug daily--withdrawal sickness severe_ including all over muscle cramps_ high anxiety_ flu like symptoms. After clear of drug for two months_ began using again to help recover from severe menstrual migraine. If I avoid taking more than 4mg per month_ and never two days in a row_ this drug prevents the terrible depression and brain fog that otherwise comes after a migraine attack_ and I don't have any withdrawal symptoms in between uses. This drug is wonderful as long as used wisely_ but maybe too many dox ignorant of what wise use means??,F,47,10  months,7/27/2006,Ativan
518, 5, anxiety/depression,It is very addictive.  On the occasional nights I dosed off before taking the medicine I woke up feeling as though I'd been hit by a truck - just from one night without the pill.,It saved my life through the stress of college.

524, 4, anxiety/depression,At first I couldn't take it during the day because I felt too stoned_ even after .5mg.  This went away as I built some tolerance.  Some slight rebound anxiety.,Excellent for anxiety_ it's unfortunate that tolerance builds so quickly.  I take 1mg at bed time and very occasionally during the day if my anxiety gets on top of me.  I am about to taper off it_ as my antidepressant has started to become highly effective at controlling my anxiety.  A great drug to use while you're in an acute state and are waiting for an antidepressant to take effect.  I have no idea how you could use it on its own though_ as you get used to it so quickly.,F,29,4  months,5/3/2006,Ativan

(i have no memory of any of this.),apparently this is a very rare side-effect.  my psychiatrist tells me that she's only seen a handful of patients react in this manner — and she has been practicing for decades and has previously held a prominent position at one of the most prestigious medical schools in the country.i took the drug as needed.  it took a while before i made the connection of taking it and the affect on my mood.,M,26, ,4/24/2006,Ativan

I HAVE HAD BAD EXPERIENCES WITH VALIUM AND XANAX WHEN TAKING IT REGULARLY AS MY ONLY MEDICATION_ IT GAVE TO ME SEVERE WITHDRAWL BETWEEN DOSES. BENZO'S ARE NOT GOOD EVERY-DAY MEDS_ BECAUSE THEY ARE SOOO TERRIBLY ADDICTING_ YOU WILL FEEL THE WITHDRAWL IF YOU MISS A DOSE_ OR ARE LATE ON A DOSE. BUT THEY SURE HELP WHEN YOU'RE GOING NUTS EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. WITHIN 20 MINUTES OF CONSUMPTION I FEEL RELIEF. DOCTOR TOLD ME TO PUT A TABLET UNDER MY TONGUE FOR A FASTER REACTION. THIS DOES WORK.

It seems to be the miracle cure for everything anxiety related.,There is a lot of warning about ativan being habit forming. I don't doubt that it is. But if you're smart about it you can use it sensibly. I've been on this drug as needed for five years or so now without a problem. You just have to use it only when you absolutely need it. If you find you're taking it regularly you might want to talk to your doctor about changing any other anti anxiety meds you may be on (like Zoloft_ or Paxil). Don't compensate for more anxiety by taking more ativan. All you have to do is be careful and this drug can be a great help.,F,20,5  years,2/24/2006,Ativan

Forewarned is forearmed!,"I would take 1 mg on a casual basis for travel and anxiety etc.  Over the past couple of years I found I would take it for just about every malady - anxiety_ insomnia_ hangovers etc.  I was using about thirty pills every two months.  A few months ago one of the doctors at the clinic warned me and said that Ativan is a ""bullshit drug"" and I should exercise extreme caution.  Of course_ I thought he was being overly cautious and ignored his advice.  Over the past few months I have been plagued by problems associated with heart disease_ such as severe left side pain_ shortness of breath although I work out regularly and consider myself somewhat fit.  Ativan would always restore my sense of well being.  This past couple of weeks_ I tended to over indulge (to my way of thinking).  Took a pill almost every day in the week leading to Christmas_ two on Christmeas Eve_ two on Christmas Day and because I only had four left and did not wish to be be rebuffed by my doctor_ decided to leav",M,52,17  years,1/3/2006Email,Ativan

It works great if used in this manner. Don't bother taking this medication long term if you can't do this (regulate). You must be willing to use it on an as needed basis_ but you will still need to take some each day (lowest possible dose) to prevent insomnia (when I take just 1 mg I take it before bedtime).",M,49,3  years,12/27/2005,Ativan
551, 4, alcohol withdrawal symptoms,the first few days i was extremely drowsy and slept most the day.  i was always freezing but sweat so much i soaked the sheets.  it did help with the shakes andhelped me to keep food down. i had been  throwing  up each morning and constant diarrhea although i wasn't eating.  this allowed me to stop throwing up and keep down soup.,i was told not too take it more often than every 4 hrs. i take 1mg 3 times a day but i find myself counting the hours until i can take it again.  i've only been on it 5 days but still i worry about addiction.  i have severe liver damage and i imagine this is better than drinking but i don't need another addiction.  also i cry alot.  but i want to stay sober.  i'll stay on it til the shaking stops but it makes me feel a litle dingy. i need to talk to my doctor again.,F,49,5  days,12/26/2005,Ativan

I am just afraid of taking it during the day when i am at work cause i am afraid i will fall asleep at my desk. I get very sleepy when I take it at night. I also was wondering if I get  a headache during the day can I take a tylenol and then at night take my ativan? Can someone let me know. Thanks again..,Is is true that you can develop cardiovacular disease with this drug? I really dont want to get addicted to it so im a little worried about that.

554, 5, Loss of wife through illness,None_ but looked forward to relaxing or lying down.,If it wasn't for this drug I never would have gotten through the unbelievable stress_ grief_ pressure_ that I endured in watching someone disintegrate in front of my eyes. I look back on it now (4 years ago) and am amazed that I was able to function through it. All the Ativans in the world could not get me to do it again. But as I said at that time there was nothing else I could turn to independently without showing to the rest of my family how really weak I was. I did not realize later how difficult it was to stop the drug_ you definitely have to go very slowly or you'll be experiencing other symptoms. Even now_ I always keep them around as safety crutch.

Now I've read that the damage it causes to the brain is often permanent.,Wow_ it sure does help me sleep and I haven't found a replacement. Am hopefully going to see an Orthomolecular Doctor because I've tried enough of the anti-depressants and anti-psychotics to know that I have no confidence in them. I was anorexic for years and suffered various malnutrition problems which I think hurt my nervous system. I sort of have an ability to feel when the electrical wiring is overloaded or the wires are crossed in a building.

I cannot for the life of me get off the stuff.  I've tried to switch_ but they never know how to make the adjustment. Switching I don't see as a good  option_ but at the same time_ I'm just maintaining the dose 2mg 4xday (8mg) but really_ it no longer touches me; (  Not sure what to do_ but would realllly like to eliminate it.

Later on when she told me 20 days later that it is addictive_ I wanted to only use it on needed basis. This is when nightmare began. The chest pain and cunfusion became so bad that I called ER. I concluded finally that it was withdrawal symptoms. When I took it I was fine. It took me exactly 9 monthsto come off of .5 mg twice a day. I broke the pills in 2 piece _ then 4 and basically tapered myself. It was the scariest feeling I had im my life. I felt like I was dying from heart attack. Never again I would take this.

580, 1, Insomnia due to hyperactive thyroid,I started taking 2 mg per day at bedtime. After about a year_ I experienced anxiety during the day_ and my doctor thought that my thyroid condition was getting worse_ so he doubled my Ativan dose. A few months later_ I became anxious again_ and it turned out the anxiety was caused by the fact that I had reached tolerance to the Ativan and needed more in order to feel,Ativan should only be taken on a short-term basis. It's actually possible to become addicted to Ativan after taking it for as short a time as a month. It is very potent and highly addictive. Had I known it would affect me in the way it did_ I never would have taken it in the first place. I tried to wean myself off Ativan_ but was unsuccessful in doing so because I suffered from severe interdose withdrawal symptoms. A kind_ caring doctor in an attempt to wean me off the Ativan switched me to Valium so that I could taper myself off that drug. Valium has a longer half-life_ so it's much easier for people who are addicted to Ativan to get off Benzodiazepines by switching to Valium. The website_ www.benzo.org.uk contains a copy of the Ashton Manual_ which is considered the best resource to use if you're considering tapering off a Benzodiazepine tranquilizer_ such as Ativan. I am 58 years old. I never took recreational drugs in my life_ and I discovered at age 55 that I was a geriatric junkie because of the Ativan.

599, 5, Prostatitis\Pain,I'm not sure why but this drug is really the only drug that stops the pain associated with Prostatitis. There are times when I'm in so much pain I can't do much of anything but this drug lets me sleep. I try to keep is down to ONE pill in 24 hours at most but God knows it lets me sleep and forget about the pain for a little while. It also allows me to urinate if I run the shower and let the water splash on me.,This drug works but it frightens me half to death! I think its a narcotic. I have always taken pride in the fact that I have stayed away from drugs like this but now I just sit in pain and wait for 12 mid night when I can take this thing. The pain is bad enough where it takes this drug about three hours to work but once taken I get relieve for about 12 hours. Once this drug wares off I then use Ibuprofine then a Vicodin to keep me from being in total pain. One good thing_ I've lost weight and I look like I did in High School! I know I'm in big trouble here because there isn't a cure for Prostatitis type IIIA and the pain can drive me up the walls_ can't eat or drink much. The last time I couldn't urinate they used a catheter! Being that everything down their is very inflamed the experiance was horrible. So if anyone has any ideas I'm all ears. I'm hoping that if I only use the Lorazepam once a day I'll be OK for a while. The Doctors just keep feeding me AntiBiotics but I don't think they are doing anything at all because type IIIA doesn't have infection associated with it. They did a urine test and culture.
