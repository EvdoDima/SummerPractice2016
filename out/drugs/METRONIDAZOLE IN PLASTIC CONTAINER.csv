1, 4, Wisdom tooth infection,Severe headaches and pressure behind my eyes. Muscle pain in neck and lower back. Loss of all energy. Confusion and general innability to 'think straight'.,I was prescribed this drug along with amoxicillin for my infection. They certianly worked in clearing the infection_ however I was on a 5 day course and only managed 3 days. Have been off it now for two and though they're lessening_ the side effects are still there. I feel like I'm getting the flu - ALL THE TIME! I would definately ask for an alternative to this drug and wouldn't take it again unless there wasn't one.,F,29,5  days,4/19/2006,Metronidazole in plastic container
