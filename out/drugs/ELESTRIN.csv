0, 5, hormonal suppression due to Zoladex,"reduction in appetite_ nausea_ headaches_ mood swings_ depression.  These things are not gone_ but it certainly has moved me to a ""better place"" while undergoing my Zoladex/ Femara treatment.  I feel much more stable and more like myself.  And best of all_ it doesn't seem to be strong enough to overcome the hormonal suppression of the Zoladex!",Switched to Elestrin after taking Enjuvia and literally going crazy.  I've been on Zoladex for over 3 years now to suppress my hormones because of endometriosis and ovca scares_ and I needed something that would balance things out and not cause enough estrogen to counteract the effects of the Zoladex.  So far it does seem to be working pretty well.  I've had less depression or mood swings_ but do have some very hormonal days and hot flashes every once in awhile.  Overall a huge help vs battling 0 hormones with Zoladex and femara as I had been doing.  I will continue to use Elestrin.  I apply once a day on upper arm_ switching sides back and forth.  The only issue is that my husband (this is weird...) has gotten much more emotional over the past few months- moody_ emotional_ tired_ etc- almost like male PMS.  We are both wondering if perhaps the Elestrin is leeching out of my skin onto the bed sheets or he is brushing up against my arm in the middle of the night.  Ladies- want to make your man feel like a woman?  This is the way to do it!  (Poor guy.  He's been very sympathetic...),F,31,5  months1 pump 1X D,8/9/2010Email,Elestrin
