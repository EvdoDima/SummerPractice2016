0, 5, ADD,Insomnia on days I've taken concerta too late_ loss of appetite_ minor headaches,Probably the best tablet I have ever come across. I can plan my day and get hours of studying done. Boosts my confidence when I'm writing tests or exams.Also have enough energy and concentration to perform well at work.,M,24,2  years36mg 1X D,8/5/2016Email,Concerta
1, 4, ADD,do not drink alcohol with it or you'll regret it in the morning you'll want to die and you'll most certainly feel that sh** for more than a day and you're body will hurt like a bitch for some reason _ at least mine did !!! Whatever it is _ don't drink and take it _ just a horrible idea with horrible consequences following ..,I loved it _ helped me focus continued to work better each time and made me feel like a million bucks I'd say it helped get rid of some of my anxieties and depression too with the right amount and it was nice for a change considering nothing else has worked for me but concerta does me good I guess !  also_ do not recommend for addicts because you will get hooked fast and take way too many leading up to a certain point cuz it is a great way to speed out but not what it's meant for and could really harm you . trust me I tried it and than ended up taking it only for the right reason and it works just fine for me now. And as I said before no alcohol with it once agajn_ it's just a risk not worth taking_ especially with the hard liquors such as Malibu _ Bacardi _ Whiskey or anything of the type !,F,16,5  days54 mg,8/1/2016Email,Concerta
2, 3, Adult ADD/Depression,Since it generally was to help w/my Focus & Concentration_ it would work :) However_ it'd make me jittery_ fast heartbeat & headache... Recently (past month) the headaches have increased from being Mild & Manageable to now being Moderate & Irritating. Also_ nausea set in 2-3wks ago & just last week began the nausea followed by vomiting :(,*This rating is my 'current stint w/Concerta_ tho took it B4_ years ago* -- Take it AS PRESCRIBED (for all U addicts out there)!

5, 3, Depression/overweight from other Rx,I lost a lot of weight on this med_ nearly 50 pounds. It super jacked up my metabolism. I went from size 18 to size 10 fast. On the down side I couldn't stop the dry mouth no matter what I did/used. I actually got 'meth mouth' and my teeth broke and crumbled. My dentist tried hard to save them but after 2 years I had ALL of my teeth pulled and now wear dentures. A sad outcome.,It made me thin_ made my hair thin too. Lost my teeth. The doctor who put me on this med never warned me about what could happen. It's one thing to say on the package it causes dry mouth but the FDA should make them warn this could lead to tooth loss_ which in my case it did!,F,55,2  years30mg,6/24/2016,Concerta

7, 2, ADD,I am sensitive to EVERY medication_ and always get the weirdest side effects.  I liked Concerta ok for my ADD_ but the side effects were not worth it.  I was constantly bloated and my digestion was not good while on this medication.  When I increased my dose from 36mg to 54mg_ the digestive distress increased and I developed a major fungal infection. Had to take Diflucan to combat it.  My voice was also getting more hoarse.  I recommend the medication because of the effectiveness of keeping me focused_ but could not tolerate the side effects.,,F,45,45  days54 mg 1X D,6/20/2016,Concerta

10, 1, For college and work,Loss of appetite_ depressed_ anxiety_ acne_ fast heart beat_ nausea,I started taking concerta for school about two years ago. I am currently trying to be done with it. It gives me horrible acne. It makes me depressed and have horrible anxiety. Which makes me smoke ciggerates which if I don't take the medication i can't stand the smell of them. I have never been so depressed in my life. It helped me in school but I can find other ways to concentrate. It gives me head aches and make me nauseous in the morning. I have a three year old and if I take my meds I have to wait till I come down to even be social with him. Cooking for him when I take it makes me sick to my stomach. I get head aches here and there. It's the devil stay away find alternative ways to coup with everyday task. Also any loud noises like music loudly irrates me and i just want to be left alone in my room plus it makes me feel tired but can't sleep.,F,24,2  years36,3/19/2016,Concerta
11, 3, Diagnosed ADHD,at the start (Fatigue_ tiredness_ change in appetite_ loss of weight),I was taking Concerta XL when I was 14-16 to improve my concentration at school. I was being sent out of classes a lot and was generally a really rude person.  At the start_ I noticed that my appetite had changed a lot_ I was also crying a lot to begin with. After about 4 months I had lost a fair amount of weight. I had noticed that my appetite started to pick up_ but instead of me eating junk food (like I usually would) I would start to eat healthier foods? Which seemed a little odd. I believe this medication does work_ I managed to go from getting E's and D's in most of my GCSE's to passing them all with C's and B's. However_ I do believe that you need to want to change/help yourself for this medication_ like all medications_ to become effective. I'm now at University and I find it hard to believe that a few years ago I was failing mostly everything and didn't know what I'd be doing later in life. Also_ i think it is important to identify that I also applied myself more. So if you're prescribed this medication_ you also need to work with it for it to benefit you.  I hope this information is beneficial for anybody who is reading.,M,22,2  years30mg 1X D,3/16/2016,Concerta
12, 3, improve my concentration at school.,Weightloss_decreased appetite.(but i also get extremely hungry)_ irritation_ depression_ blurred vision_ insomnia_ anxiety.,From the age of 12 till 17 i took about 54mg of concerta daily. Iam now im my final year in high school_ ive been taking 100mg due to the increased amount of work at school. Ive never till today felt so depressed_ my confidence in down the drain_ i no longer want to play netball or go to school dances. I feel that i dont have a personality_ im constantly very quiet and reserved. Its gotten so bad that i fear of leaving my room at boarding school and if i do i make sure i come back asap. I easily feel intimidated and im always thinking that im not good enough. Concerta does help me concentrate_ i do one thing at a time and im very patient. Weirdly my hearing has improved tremendously_ for example; im able to hear when someone is walking down the passage quiet a distance away. When im studying and concentrating really hard_ ill tune in to the sound of someone crunching a paper or drawing with a pencil on the other side of the room and get extremely irrated or if a clock ticks ill stare at it for a long time (hoping that it will stop). Judging from my marks at school_ concerta has helped me alot. But the way i feel about myself now_regarding my self esteem and doing things at school or anywhere_ i wouldnt want anyone to feel like this. Yes i have been to a psychologist many times_ but honestly it doesnt help. I feel i cant go without concerta. Actually my body is dependent on it_ i can immediately feel when i havent taken it_ i feel almost tipsy and i struggle to speak properly_,F,17,7  years100mg,2/13/2016Email,Concerta

14, 5, ADHD,Cold and/or sweaty extremities.  Loss of appetite.  Trouble sleeping.Trouble staying hard during sex.,I have been taking concerta fror 11 years and have gone through numerous dosage changes and even stopped and restarted the drug.  From my experience this drug works well to increase concentration_ focus_  and attention.  Helps me do one thing at a time without jumping from task to task.  Slso this supresses my appetite which has helped me maintain normal weight.,M,19,10  years54,2/12/2016,Concerta

18, 4, ADHD,I didn't feel that I experienced any of the side effects of concerta apart from loss of appetite and a few minor things but things that have happened in the past few days have made me realise that I a lot of things about me have changed but not all of them are for the best I now feel like I have lost the real me a little like I have lost my personality and I have noticed that my confidence to do things and self confidence has dropped huge amounts I don't do anything or try anything if I think someone will have something to say about it I fear that if I try letting go and be myself that I will lose friends and people won't like me I don't try any thing new anymore even things to do with myself like new styles because of fear of being judged and fear that people won't like it_ I don't even like expressing my opinion and get nervous when I think I've done some that people won't like and I know my real personality is nothing like that_ I feel dependant on concerta and actually fear trying a different medication or coming off of medication as if I'm afraid of the real me and my real personality. I am sharing this just to make people think about what it's actually effecting about yourself and don't just look for the named side effects like loss of appetite and and stuff look at yourself and how you've changed but don't get me wrong over the years I have been taking concerta it hasn't all been negative_ my graves in school went from E's - D's to B's - A*'s and I am now studying at c,at college_ passing all of my assessments I also stopped fighting and I had been known throughout school for fighting. Look at the way it has changed you not just the way it has changed you body and don't just look for the side effects that have names like for example if you have started feeling down after you start taking concerta don't just think ahh it's nothing don't look at the side effects and see depression and think well my low mood must just be me_ is just me_ it's not the medication because I'm not depressed and that's what the side effect associated with your mood is called. I hope me sharing this will help at least a few people.,M,16,4  years72 mg,2/2/2016Email,Concerta

21, 3, ADD,I can attest to what your son is experiencing: cold (feet and hands)_ heart discomfort or at least an irregular feeling_ as well as anxiety when comming off the medication. As a 200lbs man on a 18mg daily dose I can imagine what the effects would be for a smaller boy.

22, 3, my son has adhd,Since my son has been on concerta he been complaining Bout chest pain_ being cold and been getting muscle spam. I had to drop him from 36mg to27mg. The doctor states his symptoms are not related to concerta_ but since I drop his dosage some of his symptom have been reduce. He gets headaches nausea_ dizzyness and his vison blurr_ and the worse muscle spam. I ask my doctor to change his medication and he was not willing to. So I am going in for a second opinion. For some reason doctors do not want to report serious side effects of concerta. It helps him concentrate but has a lot of side effects.

Most of the time when im on concerta_ i feel almost emotionless. Also_ if i stop taking concerta for one day after taking it for a long period of days_ i get very high levels in confidence and happiness.,Besides all the negatives_ concerta has helped me concentrate much better_ making me feel like if i have homework_ that i will just do it with out any distractions and it has helped me to cope better with working and focusing on school work_ in class with noisy_ disruptive classmates.,F,16,3  years27mg,11/25/2015,Concerta

27, 4, ADD,Fast heart rate_ anxiety_ easily annoyed attitude_ and loss of appetite.,Concerta helps me to focus more and stay on task. I am an outgoing and social person_ even on concerta. However_ on concerta I sometimes refrain myself from socialzing at times that I normally would. My first year taking concerta I lost 19 pounds in the first three months at 18mg. After I became more immune to the pill_ my dosage went up to 56mg. I have gained the weight back_ although in muscle since I am an athlete. If you are an athlete and take concerta_ know that while you are playing in a game you may feel like you are about to throw up sometimes. This is due to your loss of appetite in lunch and since you didn't take in much energy from the little food you have eaten_ the acidity in your stomach causes you to have a strong gag reflex. Also_ after going a day without eating on the pill and exercising_ you should hydrate because you will become dehydrated on top of being starved and will become easily annoyed by everything around you. Overall_ concerta has helped me maintain good grades and stay organized.,F,14,2  years56mg,11/21/2015,Concerta
28, 2, ADD,Irritability_ anxiety_ self-conciousness_ social anxiety_ appetite-loss_ loss of control_ depression_ insomnia_ migraines_ discomfort.,I took concerta when I was 13 and am currently taking it at age 15 (against my will). Concerta was very helpful for me in the ways of focusing on tasks_ getting things done_ and paying attention in class; but it caused irrational worry and a very high heart rate. It made me extremely tense and uncomfortable physically_ and also very self-concious about everything about myself. I became an outcast and had no friends. I was afraid to do anything for fear of judgement_ and my personality was lost as I became quiet and withdrawn socially. I did stop taking it for one year last year_ and socially and emotionally my life was so_ so much better_ but my grades and focus plummeted. At the beginning of this year however_ I entered high school (at grade 10) and my grades were worse than before and I was falling behind in everything_ so I was back on Concerta. I recommend finding another medication for ADD/ADHD. I would be trying something different if I could.,F,15,1  years36MG,11/3/2015Email,Concerta

30, 4, ADHD,GOOD: the ability to concentrate and focus on a specific subject at a time. Increased patience and willingness to do long activities such as reading or homework. Created empathy towards others and general calmness. I can think of things before i do or say them and usually have better judgement. Reduces hunger which can make you drink more water or pick healthier foods. More serious_ i generally just want to accomplish stuffBAD: dry mouth_ lack of appetite_ difficulty in being social with others_ less able to joke around with my friends since i have no humour_ feel like im depressed_ hard time sleeping_ harder to talk to girls and my friends say im boring when i do take it.,Mind you_ I am at this point still 17 and my thoughts of good or bad may be wrong or simply change within the future.

32, 5, Adhd,My only negative is that the doctors don't really tell you how to take the medicine and the insurance companies along with the doctors don't feel the need to require n provide us with nutritionists. I can go on n on about this but after reading everyone's complaints most of them are totally correctable if we were provided with more serious instructions n a nutritionist. For example if I take my concerta 10 minutes past 9:15 I will be up_ full functional n productive all day n night long. Or how some of us become extremely sensitive to sugar n that it should be avoided at all costs. All it takes is one experience to realize. Or how extremely important protein is for us n how we need to be having what is at least 10 grams every 3-4 hours. Once you have one bad,Experience I can promise you will never make that mistake again. For me it impairs all of my senses to the point I can't visually or audio recognize my own father if he was standing in front of my talking to me. I am unable to speaker cause my toung curls up n you can forget my ability to  comprehend a thing. N it is a very slow recovery. If that happens around 1 or 2 o'clock I am done for the day. I need to go hm n relax for the rest of the day. Normally I don't even want to drive anywhere. The harder I make my concerta wk for me the more I need to monitor my protein intake. If you are pron to depression you should have a pet..a dog_ cat_ bird_ horse_ etc. oh n you never take concerta with other medicine_  exercise enhancement type stuff_ or vitamins n not eat with in  absolute  max 30 minutes! Excercise n eating healthy can help you decrease your dose a little. Omega 3 n caffeine without sugar  enhances your medicine. N when studying if you take a short break..a complete mind break every 5 minutes your ability to retain info is  absolutely beyond mind blowing! It will bring tears to your eyes. I even try to carry emergency protein in my purse n car.,F,41,11  years72 1X D,9/29/2015,Concerta
33, 4, Adhd,Extreme weight loss_ irrability_ weakness_ headaches,I have pretty bad adhd and was prescribed Concerta in May. I started with 18mg which didn't help too much. Then went to 36mg and didn't help either and now I'm at 54mg and it helps wiTh concentrating in class. I took it in May and June then stopped over the summer. 4 weeks into taking it I lost my appetite and lost 10 pounds. Over the summer I gained the weight back. Beginning of September (3 weeks ago) I've lost about 10-15 pounds. I barely eat at all. I can't even snack. I get extremely irritated quickly as well. I play hockey and I can't stay on very long because there is no carbs in my body to give me energy. I've also become very anxious 24/7. I DO NOT recommend concerta for anyone.,F,15,3  months54 mg,9/24/2015Email,Concerta
34, 4, ADHD,Appetite loss_ irritability_ headache_ frailness/weakness_ weight loss.,I first began to use Concerta two years ago when I was diagnosed with ADHD. Right away my teachers saw improvement in work_ but at what cost? I lost my appetite_ sometimes completely_ and would not eat lunch. I lost around 8 pounds in the first year from malnutrition until I gained it back over the summer for the fact that I didn't take it during the summer. I was also extremely irritable to everything around me. Every small sound or sound of a pen tapping on a table while I was trying to focus would enrage me and it is extremely hard to control especially around friends. My inability to eat also brought along a slew of new symptoms such as frailness and weakness. My hands would shake as I would write something down or type something on my laptop. Although this medicine did help_ its side effects can be a turn off for some people_ if you have issues with anger_ eating_ or weight I would NOT recommend this drug. I countered the appetite loss by eating large dinners and large breakfasts_ the irritability is countered by sound canceling headphones while doing work. Headaches are countered with constant water consumption. Frailness and weakness is countered by constant working out and sports activities. Also_ sports seems to help with the irritability. Weight loss can be stopped by large meals and sports.,M,17,2  years54 1X D,9/21/2015Email,Concerta

36, 4, ADHD,"If Concerta has intolerable side effects_ do not switch over to an amphetamine containing drug (Adderall_ Vyvanse_ Dexedrine). Amphetamine is a potent neurotoxin that destroys your brains dopamine neurons. Type in ""amphetamine and parkinsons disease risk""_ ""amphetamine neurotoxicity in ADHD"" and ""dopaminergic dysfunction in dextroamphetamine users"" for more information. An amphetamine containing drug will not turn you into a mentally retarded person_ but it will destroy your brains dopamine neurons (in the range of 40-70%) and therefore when you stop taking it_ even after as little as a month_ you will have a permanently reduced capacity to experience pleasure.",Concerta has a lot of side effets due to its ridiculous absorption and release system and due to the fact that it contains the left isomer of methylphenidate (L-Methtlphenidate) which is not only useless but actual blocks the benificial effects of D-Methylphenidate. Focalin XR is far more effective and lacks the side effects of Concerta_ so I recommend you ask your doctor if you can try it. Neither Concerta_ Ritalin or Focalin are neurotoxic (brain damaging) But remember_ stay away from amphetamine containing ADHD meds_ they will mess you up permanently in the long run! Thats why they aren't available in Europe for ADHD.,M,28,2  months50 MG,9/13/2015,Concerta

My marks in school aslo went up as I was more attentive in class and the quality of my work improved dramatically.Every time my dosage increased_ my grades increased_ I became more attentive in class_ I also became more observant. I'm not allowed to drive a car unless I have taken my Concerta (or_ if its later in the day/evening and it's wearing off_ at least 5mg of ritalin).My teachers at school have said that I'm a completely different kid now compared to a couple of months ago - when I was on a lower dose. They've said I'm more confident in class_ the quality and quantity of the work I produce in class has increased tenfold.I won't do any assignments or homework if I have forgotten to take the Concerta because I'm no longer hapoy with the work I produce without it.

38, 2, ADD,Extreme nausea_ dizziness_ emotionally numb_ headache_ trouble breathing_ insomnia_ paranoia_ passed out,I took Concerta during different stages of my life. When I was a child_ a sophomore in hs_ and a junior in college (now). When I was child_ it worked miracles. My parents loved it_ I felt focused. When I was in high school I was okay on it_ minus the occasional head rush. Now I'm kicking off junior year. I wanted to do well so I figured I'd take it again. I now feel that it was a mistake. I hear a constant rushing noise in my ears_ I loose interest in things fairly quickly_ if I loose interest I don't concentrate. I'm emotionally numb_ I had a customer yell at me and I just stared him in the eye the whole time. I couldn't even fake being contrite. When I'm crashing I crash hard. But then I wake up from VERY VIVID NIGHTMARES. I feel like someone is standing over me and laying beside me which freaks me out. I've had small issues with paranoia for awhile. But it has gotten worse while taking this drug. The headaches are almost unbearable. Today takes the cake though. It's hot right now where I live and very humid. I had to walk to to work but I passed out in the middle of the sidewalk. What's weird is when I woke up I just slowly got up and kept going. I was so numb because it was the highest curve of my dosage that having that happened didn't even bother me. I'm thinking about going off of it.,F,20,6  days,9/3/2015,Concerta
39, 3, ADHD,I did not experience any side effects of concerta until after my dosage was moved up to 27mg. My third day taking it i had lost my appetite.

I was very depressed all those years on that drug and no one would listen to me because I was a foster child. It made me feel disconnected with all emotions. Some of the effects are residual and still affect me as an adult. I developed severe OCD_ which I am currently trying to control. I also lost 1/3 of my weight. I started high school weighing 170_ by the end of my Freshman year I was down to 116 because they kept upping my dosage.

My biggest issue is (obviously) focus. I have a problem that I can't control what I focus on and when. I am a full time online student at a university with a full time and a part time job_ I have no choice but to have so much going on. For example_ When I am at work_ I can only think about school and will try to take opportunities to look at my online classes and get things done at work when I have things that I should be doing and vise versa when I am at home at night trying to focus on getting school work done_ I can't stop focusing on work. In conversations_ I am constantly cutting people off_ but I can't help it because if I don't say what I am thinking I will forget but when I do have the chance to talk_ I am easily distracted and will lose my train of thought and it not only frustrates me but my family and friends_ which is why I sought out a psychiatrist_ after speaking to therapists and trying different non stimulants that worked for depression_ but not so much for ADHD. My psychiatrist upped my dose because its working_ but not really too effectively at this point in my opinion so we are going to try sticking to the same medicine but upping the dose to 36mg.

I heard terrible voices in my head. I thought people could read my mind. many strange things happened to me as a direct result of this medication. I became similar to someone with scitchfremia. I would have awful nightmares each night. I would be so scared to go to sleep because of these terrible awful nightmares. Because of that I lost sleep which only made things worse. I thought people were out to get me and wanted to hurt me. I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone_ not even my worst enemy. Please whoever reads this_ be carful!

They tried me on Concerta. My grades improved at first but then came the bad stuff. Like Ritalin_ Concerta made me disgusted by the taste and smell of food_ I would only eat once every 3 days_ I was 5' 0"" and weighed 106 lbs. I went from being a social people person to scared to death to even look someone in the eyes_ I thought people could read my mind. I'm not schizophrenic but stimulants bring out side effects that make me think like one. Extreme insonmia_ only slept for 6 hours every 3 days. OCD like symptoms_ started checking everything 3 times_ all labels on products had to be facing a certain way_ I felt like a zombie like I was in my body but something else was controlling my movements and thoughts. Also had heart palpitations. My normally healthy heart would suddenly beat like thump-thump-thu-thu-thump and I would gasp for air when it happened. I took from age 15-18 then again from 19-22. I tried taking a break at age 18 but I lost every job I had and had no option but to start back_ otherwise I could not function as an adult.

I could go on_ but I'd rather go ponder my sanity in bed upstairs while I get no sleep tonight.,I guess this works for some people. I am not one of them. I have taken Concerta at a couple different points in my life - most recently I started taking it again (I am 30 now) and have only taken it for 8 days and today will be the last day of this psychotic experiment. Apparently I forgot how terrible it was the first couple of attempts years ago as it was stuffed down my throat by my parents because their boy-genius suddenly couldn't pay attention in classes once he got to high school. I'm BEYOND tired of trying different medications. Stimulants don't mesh well with anxiety_ although my anxiety is unfortunately rooted in my ADHD and inability to complete anything I start. Somehow I'm a successful (by societal standards) young adult that is married and has a great job at a Fortune 500 Company. The only thing that has ever helped me successfully cope with my ADHD and Anxiety is Marijuana. Period. I stopped smoking it the past couple of months_ but that changes tomorrow. I'll take whatever minor side effects come with it (you know: sleeping well_ being able to focus and complete tasks_ the ability to relax)_ because they're not nearly as terrible as every other fucked up prescription drug I've taken along this terrible and seemingly pointless and torturous journey they call life.

I've been taking that for over 2 months now and I've had a 2 week early menstrual cycle that comes with Nasty cold sores (not prone to cold sores) as well as relationship problems. The adderall caused me to start a cycle of ultra rapid cycling bipolar disorder displays. If your already anxious and panic and withdrawl socially_ don't take adderall_ it will make your anxiety into mania hell. I'm going to the clinic today to beg them to step me off of it.

58, 1, ADHD,Anxiety_ Social withdrawal_ Weight and appetite loss_ Depression_ Chest pain,I was given Ritalin for 4 years and they switched me to Concerta. I remember ritalin making me socially withdrawn_ I had trouble having close friends but I still played at recess and stuff. From age 10 to 13 I went through hell. I was taking the pills 365 days a year. I know for fact I was on 36mg for a short time but then I was upped to 54 and that's when it started. I entered high school and I couldn't make friends_ I couldn't socialize. I was thin and never ate_ I remember chest pain and my heartbeat going crazy giving me chest pain. I had high anxiety levels all the time. I stopped taking it in the last month of the first highschool year_ my parents were forcing me to take it_ and even told me the side effects were in my head. When I stopped I started getting more depressed and slipped into depression_ I had anxiety attacks and chest palpitations_ though no more chest pain. It took 2 full years to get rid of that and to this day I still have anxiety and still deal with episodes of being overall extremely depressed. My appetite came back so vividly that I have stretch marks because of the weight I too suddenly gained as I felt hunger for the first time in 3 years. I was never anxious or depressed before taking concerta and now I'll probably have to deal with it for the rest of my life. It's been almost 8 years and I still deal with this.

59, 3, ADD,- Constant headaches- Mood swings - Nausea,Suffered with ongoing headaches throughout the day_ but this can be minimised by ensuring to drink the recommended amount of water in a day; Nausea kicked in from time to time_ but could be due to forgetting to eat_ as engrossed in activity (possibly excitement from being able to focus a lot_ after so many years of not doing so); Mood swings are definitely my biggest problem with this drug. I don't feel like myself anymore and I find that I am a lot more quiet_ more irritable_ and more prone to reacting negatively to pressure than I used to be. I find it a lot more difficult to be around my friends as I don't feel like I have much to say anymore. As strange as it sounds_ I feel like my soul has been extracted from my body and replaced with one that's robotic and isn't a real person. I have no idea whether or not these side effects are temporary and whether I get them so severely because I have only just started taking them. I have definitely been a lot more productive and am able to use my time effectively and I'm really glad.

Yes_ it does take away your appetite_ but remembering to eat small meals throughout the day (even if you are not hungry) is actually better than 3 large ones.  Your metabolism will start to work better and your brain will get the fuel it needs through out the day_ allowing you to concentrate properly.  I always reach for walnuts_ almonds_ yogurts_ bananas to nibble on through the day when I don't have an appetite so that I'm not starving my body or brain.This also comes from a  person who has suffered from Bulimia for 10+ years.  It has been the only thing that has helped me manage impulsive eating_ binging and purging.  When on the meds_ and taking them properly_ I have a better sel,This drug has saved me from depression and binge eating.I am taking other meds to deal with a slew of issues that came from not being diagnosed with ADD sooner.  History - ADD - my lack of control and insecurity with being unable to concentrate and do homework was overwhelming.  Because I was not hyperactive and overweight_ I was not diagnosed. I coped with stress by binge eating.  In my last year of highschool_ I lost weight_ and after a really hard 1st year in University_ I was put on anti depressants because I had a nervous breakdown during an exam that I had studied for weeks.  MY memory was horrible and nothing stuck.  I could never just cram_ because it was useless.  Within months of being on antidepressants_ I discovered bulimia and became hypomanic. I eventually got off the antidepressants_ but the bulimia stuck around.After 8 years with the ED_ I researched my condition and begged my GP and psychiatrist for years to start ADD meds_ but they wouldn't because they were afraid that I would abuse the drug to lose weight.  I knew that I wouldn't...and guess what_ I DON'T - it helps people like me. Instead of that_ they said I was bipolar II - I am medicated for that_ but apparently_ had I been diagnosed properly with ADD 10+ years ago_ there is a high chance that I wouldn't have had depression_ bipolar or the ED.I'm actually a lot smarter than I ever thought.  I just went back to school to pursue a Masters in Clinical Psychology to help people like myself who,F,31,2  years36 1X D,4/5/2014Email,Concerta

83, 2, adhd combined,When i first started taking this drug it was life changing and worked really well. I was able to complete a college course and do things like deal with supermarket queues without a problem. Main side effect for me was i lost an awful lot of weight and my drinking and smoking cigarettes became too much as i felt dependant on them to unwind at she end of the day. I decided to make effort to stop drinking and smoking and join a gym. I felt as long as i continued taking my medication i would never be able to stop drinking and smoking. So i Stopped taking my medication and went to the gym. The gym really helped instead of medication but i was training 3 times a day and got very addicted until i injured myself. I wasn't able to train for a long time and i started to deteriorate. So i to take my mediation again and i feel awful. This time around i am two stone heavier  and it does nothing to suppress my appetite. I am constantly hungry. I feel angry all the time and i have  more sensory issues than even before!

89, 2, son taking for adhd,My son has been on concerta for 7/8 years for adhd.  He has always had emotional outbursts but has been a pretty good kid.  He struggled in school and functioning in general. Just in the past 3 months he has self injured himself. He is dealing with depression_  failing school_low self esteem_ and seem to have no emotion or feelings.  He does not have any real friends and stays up in his room. He is also on zoloft now and has been on 300 mg of seroquel and 3 mg of intunive to help him sleep at night.  I am starting to feel like these meds have had an effect on him and his personality.  I am missing the fun loving son I had.  Are these long term affects or can they get better in time by weening him off these meds.

90, 5, ADHD_ OD_ and OCD,Once this medicine is taken with breakfast my son goes from bouncing off of the walls and being way too hyper_ to relaxed and happy. By the time school lets out he is crabby_ and just plain angry. He is fine after a small snack of fruits or vegetables. Overall this medicine works wonderfully.  He is in 9th grade now and has always only gotten A's. and B's on his report cards since he started this medication in 1st grade. He is now an Honors student who has chosen to go into the medical field. He loves school and loves to learn. ADHD doesn't get in the way of what my son wants to achieve in his life. He doesn't fit in with big groups of kids but has one or two goos friends and he is fine with that. He is on a swim team. I would suggest swimming for any child with ADHD. It is a great outlet for their energy since they have to use their entire body to swim. My son did ok in softball and soccer too_ but swimming is his favorite because he said he can move all around so freely. My son is also on Kapvay which is a long acting form of Clonidine. This helps with his higher blood pressure and sleeplessness due to taking the Concerta. He was on 72mg of Concerta for a few years but we took him down to 54mg with no problems two years ago. My son also got horrible migraines. Sometimes 4 or more in one day. His neurologist put him on Zoloft since my son has high anxiety and his Migraines went away completely! My son has a great team of doctors and for that I am very grateful.,,,15,8  years54mg,11/15/2013Email,Concerta

94, 3, ADHD,Insomnia_ acne_ loss of appetite_ social isolation_ shaking_ over reacting,I have a very mixed opinion on this medicine. I am unsure whether or not to go to a higher dose due to the negative side affects. My acne has significantly worsened since I began this medicine. I also have had problems with my eating habits. Before taking the medicine I had a fairly good diet_ but this medicine has made it extremely difficult to keep a good diet. I find myself hungry_ but disgusted by the idea of food_ which usually lasts a couple days of not eating enough. Then I come to the point where the only things I am willing to eat are unhealthy foods_ (I have gone days only eating ice cream). I also tend to binge eat when the medicine wears off due to my lack of nutrition. Socially I have become withdrawn and find myself often not wanting to bother spending time with people and instead just do something on my own_ mainly due to how self critical I am naturally_ which this medicine has seriously amplified. Concentration wise I love it_ I find myself becoming more and more interested in academics than I ever have_ but as I become more use to this dose I find myself becoming distracted_ and then becoming extremely concentrated on irrelevant things. Academically this has been amazing_ other than that it has definitely caused more problems than it has solved.,F,17,4  months36 1X D,9/23/2013,Concerta

97, 4, ADHA,headaches_ dry mouth_ urinating a lot!,I noticed as my life had become more hectic_ that I was not able to stay on task.  I would start doing the dishes_ and I would get a few done and then I would bounce to the living room and start dusting_ then I would go back to the dishes ect. I would be talking to someone and be in the middle of a conversation and just up and walk away. I started out on a dose of 18mg for 1 month. Everything was great.  After 3 weeks_i felt like my old self again.  My doctor did tell me that he would have to get my dose correct. I went back to the doctor on Friday and my dose was increased to 36mg.  Saturday I started taking the new dose. I feel like im stoned! im constantly thirsty_ peeing 8-10x a day_ and ive been getting headaches. I feel that because I was just increased_ my body needs time to adjust. I can sleep better at night_ and have no issues getting to sleep. I do however get the shakes_ and tend to forget I need to eat ( could be why im getting the headaches) I am starting school the end of this month for my RN. As long as this medication can keep me as focused as it is now_ where I am getting what needs done_ done. I feel  this medication will do me wonders!! My only complaint about this medication is that I don't like the feeling of being stoned once it starts coming out of my body around 10-12 hrs after I have taken the medication.

So far he says he can focus better and he grades have improved and_ he has lots of energy. Orginally he started on 27mg but was very frightened by the side effects_ racing heart_ tremors_ extreme breathlessness and a very bad headache. He was only supoposed to be on this dose for a week then go up to the prescribed dose for his weight = 36mg. He came off for a week then dropped the dose to 18mg. Said it was much better; noticed it was very diffiuclt to come off it at the weekends as he experineced the symptoms again on monday when he re-started. After a month he said he felt the dose should go up and he started taking the 27mg. This dose seems to be working for him; suspect he could do with 36mg but he doesn't want to try this dose. Best advanage is he is no longer so depressed as his grades are better and he doesn't get into so much trouble at school anymore. He chooses himself to take continously_ no weekend breaks and even sets early morning alarm so he doesn't miss.

I completed a lot of my tasks with no distractions. I felt focused_ relaxed_ confident and had a sense of calmess. Mind you I was freaked out about trying this drug because I never took any kind of meds or drugs. It worked great. After around 5 hours the side effects kicked in. This include fast heart rate 90bpm_ nervousness_ headache_ loss of apetite. I felt kind of scared because my heart was racing_ it lasted for 4 hours. But slowly decreased in speed. I took 2 ibuprophens for my headache. Can anyone email me why my side effects were so harsh? Is 54mg too much. My doc said take on pill everyday but I feel like that's unhealthy. Please email me!

122, 4, ADD_ MDD_ and Social Anxiety/Phobia,I am about as hungry as I always was_ but now I can't eat nearly as much as used to. I've also noticed that I'm having a few more panic attacks. I'm a bit more suspicious of people_ so maybe very mild paranoia. My OCD is a bit worse. I sometimes sweat like a pig or get heartburn after taking this med. Whenever I don't take Concerta_ I feel like I've got the flu and experience severe anxiety/depression. Oh_ and the drug is constipating.,Okay_ here's a bit of exposition. See_ I was always a good student. A B was typically the lowest score I'd get. However_ when Ninth grade rolled around_ it rolled over me. My A's and B's degraded into D's and F's. I was confused about this_ and that confusion turned into rage. To put it bluntly_ I was an ass. My family berated me for my inability to focus_ which caused me a rather large amount of distress. Eventually_ I plunged into despair and just gave up. Until I received Concerta last January. This med changed my life for the better. I was rather hesitant to take this drug_ as I worried that it would worsen my anxiety. I didn't even know I had ADD_ so that was a knock.So_ the next morning dawned and I popped one of those yellow little pills. Within minutes_ I felt my focus becoming sharper and my generally dark mood starting to lift.Let me cut to the chase: This drug changed my life for the better. My GPA skyrocketed_ and is now at 3.0 and rising. I no longer harbor violent feelings toward others and myself. People like me now_ and I find myself liking them_ too. My anxiety rears its ugly head a bit more often now_ but considering the benefits that this med gave me_ I'd say it is a fair price to pay. So_ to parents and patients of every age_ I implore you to consider Concerta as a treatment option. This medicine gave me my life back.,M,16,9  months18 M.G 1X D,9/24/2012,Concerta

132, 2, ADHD,I can't believe all the reviews about anorexia and weight loss_ I had increased hunger and weight gain of about 10 pounds over the month I took Concerta. It also caused me to have visual hallucinations. Concerta is also addicting_ I found that unlike Adderall_ I found myself needing to take Concerta in the morning. It was actually good because I had a problem with taking medication every day_ but it's still an addictive drug.,For those who have taken Adderall_ I learned the hard way that Concerta is a much stronger drug. It takes a much smaller dose of Concerta to be equal to Adderall. Concerta also requires a build up over days to fully work. So_ unlike with Adderall_ if you don't take Concerta for a day or 2_ it will take a couple days to build up to full strength again. Overall_ it helped me concentrate_ but I had a lot of side-effects. And as someone who doesn't normally take medication_ I could tell it was the drug itself.

Still has deceased appetite with Focalin XR_ but I counteract that with a heafty breakfast (that includes protein) and a hearty dinner (he is starving by dinnertime).

For years_ I worked harder than my work reflected. I would get in trouble at home and school for being disorganized and for my grades_ which were lower than my sister's. Both my parents went to top universities_ and they believed I was being lazy. I became depressed.  Then_ I figured out that I probably had ADD_ and had the diagnosis confirmed by my doctor. Concerta changed my life.  I could focus in class.  My homework is super long and neat_ my lab report was the most detailed in the class. It's only been a few days but I adore Concerta :) EFFECTS:  It took about an hour to kick in. I felt razor-focused. It peaked about two hours after I took it_ and ADD symptoms came back around 7-8 hours after taking it. Time perception is off- for example yesterday morning feels like ages ago_ like it couldn't possibly be in the same week. Focus is INCREDIBLE.

These are some of the side effects that I found:-addiction-Craving cocaine-trouble sleeping-Behavior and thought problems-aggressive behavior and hostility-bipolar illness-slowing of growth (height and weight)-feeling suspicion and paranoia -psychotic symptoms-may later disrup,This is not worth it_ the school counselor tried to say it may be puberty_ but I don't think so.

I can know keep up with my peers in my field and other fields of study_ instead of being seen as the dumb girl trying to major in science.  I can safely say it was because of Concerta ability to help me think clearly that I am able to accomplish these feats.

Focus a little better_ little faster heart rate. 1 pill chewed (5:15 P.M.) slight slight numbness_ increased heart rate_ weakness. 1 pill chewed (6:30 P.M.) major increase in heart rate_ weakness_ huge insomnia_ no appetite (ate a chicken sandwhich at noon and off it I have a huge appetite) very very calm_ nervousness; probably because the side effects worried me.

Can not stop talking and does not want to attend school! We will be meeting with the doctor tomorrow. I am very worried that this medication has caused these tics that he did not have prior to taking the meds. Also_ he didn't eat much and could not fall asleep.

Did nothing besides decrease my appetite and make me want to murder someone. A week later they upped it to 27mg and it's done nothing for my focus. Decreased appetite_ so-so depression_ insomnia_ and EXTREME irritatiablity. I would NOT recommend this. I'll he switching to adderall soon.,,F,,2  weeks27mg,11/20/2011Email,Concerta
169, 5, ADHD,Slight loss of appetite. Sometimes has trouble getting to sleep. Possible OCD or tics developing?,"My son who we adopted at 6 weeks old never had any issues until 1st grade_ when school became more rigerous and he had to sit still and listen. He was constantly in trouble as he was very impulsive. He could not focus and was very distracted by everything. He was behind academically. When he entered 2nd grade things were no better_ so we reluctantly put him on meds. He started with 18mg 1x day on the Concerta and we saw no change in him. His Dr. raised his dose to 27mg 1x day and the difference in our son is amazing! We are very pleased so far with the results. School is 100% better and so is life at home with him! He can focus and he can behave. He has had slight loss of appetite_ but it's not real bad. Usually lunchtime is when he doesn't eat much_ but the other meals are fine. When he has been off the meds on a weekend_ the next time he takes it he seems to have trouble falling asleep that night. We are noticing that he may have developed a tic or OCD or something_ as he keeps moving his elbows back and forth and also his knees. He says they ""feel different"". We will keep our eye on that for now_ because the pros have outweighed the cons with this medication at this point. We hate the idea of medications because of not knowing what this will do to him for the long-term. But for now life is easier for him_ his teachers_ and us.",M,7,2  months27mg 1X D,11/8/2011,Concerta

The first few days were very questionable_ with her having major meltdowns in  the early evening as the drug was leaving her system. After her little body adjusted_ she was fine and I knew we had done the right thing when she said_""Mama_ before I took my pill_ my brain didn't work right"". Now she is in fourth grade and still takes her Concerta once a day. We see a huge difference in both her focus and behavior when she doesn't take it_ and more than two days without it and we are all unhappy...especially her. We do not allow her to use not taking it as an excuse for poor behavior...but the truth is_ she struggkes maintaining appropriate behavior without it.  Her health is good_ she is happy and well adjusted and her teachers comment about how good her focus is in class.

After being off of Concerta for the summer_ I have taken it for three days this school year and one during the summer. I still experience an extreme loss of appetite but I now also have persistent dry mouth.,I think Concerta does make it easier for me to focus in class and to organize my thoughts. The appetite loss isn't really a bad thing since I am overweight. You do however need to make sure that you eat_ if you don't_ it could cause a loss of energy and sadness. The only negative thing about taking Concerta for me is the dry mouth. It's very uncomfortable and no amount of water_ juice_ gum etc... seems to help.

183, 4, adhd,chesty cough/post nasal drip_ headaches_ dry mouth and mucous membrane_ poor circulation_ lack of appetite_ sometimes stomache aches_ and others. racing heart,I've been taking concerta for a long time_ so it's difficult for me to tell where things are a result of the medication or just a personal quirk. I have worked out that my heavy cough started around the same time I started on the medication and just never left. The dry mouth thing has been difficult and it definitely had a negative affect on my music. The loss of appetite thing is mainly annoying when you aren't in a family type situation where everyone sits down for dinner together. I've really found that you have to force yourself to eat or it just doesn't happen and the meds wear out and you're starving. Or when you eat heaps and then they kick in and you feel sick. I've occasionally gotten sharp pains in my stomache. Not too bad_ but noticeable and I believe after looking at the common symptoms list that this is why. I also stopped growing soon after I started taking it_ whether I was meant to stop growing at 12 or not will always be unknown. Whenever I've gone to the doctors_ or even my paediatrician_ they always comment about my racing heart. I really believe this is a side effect as well. All in all_ the side effects do suck_ but it's just something I deal with. Because I've been on the medication for almost 10 years most of the side effects are just things I see as being personal quirks. It's the little things that get frustrating though_ mainly the cough and dry mouth as these have further consequences (dry mouth makes cavities more likely etc).,F,21,8  years54 1X D,8/10/2011,Concerta

It does its job: it allows me to maintain concentration on a particular job.  But_ its side effects were detremental to my emotions_ social life_ sleep cycle and appetite. the concerta makes me have no desire to eat. food seems repulsive. But_ i still felt hungry physically (hunger pains)_ and if food was put infront of me_ or i would walk by the pantry or refrigerator_ i would instinctively eat.  The first few years i took the medicine_ i couldn't fall asleep easily_ especially if i took it after 10 AM. Now_ i can take it at 4 pm (if necessary) and fall asleep at 1 (which is a great improvement). It certainly helps me stay awake at night (which used to be a negative side effect_ but now with my homework is a great positive side effect). But the WORST SIDE EFFECTS were depression anxiety and EXTREME irretability that seemed to be directly proportional to my dosage (i got up to 54 mg in 10th grade_ and hated it so much that i dropped down to 18 mg later to find a balance between 27 and 36) (((**** my original dosage in 2nd grade was 18 mg))). i am still much more social off the medicine_ and am verymuch less irratible. I am comfortable with my current dosage of 27 mg (17 years old_ 5' 7"" 120 lb wet) although i have self destructive tendencies with relationships that do not seem to exist when off the medicine [i am still expirementing to see if those are due to the medicine or just my personality]. i would like to work my way",M,17,11  years27 MG 1X D,8/8/2011Email,Concerta

Why do you think people who don't have ADD are always trying to get their hands on this prescription drug?  And if it decreases your appetite then you need to account for that and make life changes!  Eat large caloric meals etc in the morning and evening to account for the mid day abstinence in hunger.  You still have to take control of you life.  It's not just handed to you in a freakin' pill.

247, 4, ADD,I got small involuntary ticks_ what struck me to be the most strange was the fact that I felt hungry but when i went to go eat something i felt disgusted at the thought of it_ ups and downs of hyperness and a productivity feeling_ and the inability to sleep until 7 am the next morning_ fast heart rate_ and it was hard to sit still.,It helped out when it came to school and homework_ which is why i got the pill. i started out on the 36 mg dose_ but it stopped working so now i am on the 54 mg dose. the effects seem to switch everytime i take the pill_ like one day ill be very happy and hyper_ and then the next ill be depressed and very anti social and i am a very outgoing person so that stuck out the most to me. i found if i drink a cup of coffee after i take the pill im more likely to get rid of the depressed possibility. it did help with my focus abilty but i wonder if thats worth the side effects i experience_ my mom thinks so haha. its your call,F,17,2  months54 mg 1X D,8/11/2010,Concerta

It was great the first week--I cut down from 2.5 lattes/day (one triple_ one double) to one per day. Started to experience severe insomnia after about 1.5 weeks so I stopped taking it. Got a lot done in that time period though. It does help you concentrate_ definitely_ but the side effects were too much for me. I was on a really low dose too.

When I first started on it around 12 it helped my ADHD and my grades shot up. I also started to have problems socializing I only had 5 or so friends at an age when most kids are friends with all the kids in there grade. once I reached 8th grade the medicine had pretty much become my way of life. Up until 8th grade I really did not really notice that my medicine made me unhappy_ in 8th grade I started to be interested in girls_ but since at this point out of my five friends 3 of them I only talked to in school_ and the other two where as socially uncomfortable as me. I never had the chance to really hang out with people or go to parties or do anything most kids did. I realized the meds were holding me back but I really did nothing about it. Then when freshmen year came around I started having more pressure then I could handle alone ( at this point I only had one good friend left.) I stopped doing my homework after school and instead would just kill time focusing on one hobby until it no longer interested me and move on with in a month to a new one. Since I was not doing my home work after school and the meds in my head demanded I get it done some time I started taking it before beds o I could not sleep and I would do my home work at around 3 or so in the morning and then to stay awake during the day I would double or triple my dosage. then repeat until the weekend.

254, 5, ADHD,Trouble going to sleep,My daughter has ADHD_ we have been on other meds_ concerta gives her control of herself.  She says she is able to concentrate in school better and is more comfortable in social settings. It actually helps with OCD and other aggressive behaviors.  To help with her sleeping she takes 3mg of meletonin and 2.5mg of clomindine to help her sleep.  Works like a charms she will sleep for 8-10 hours and feels rested in the morning.  Our experience is not enough sleep can effect her ADHD_ no matter what meds she is on.  She and we feel she is more herself when she is on it_ because she can control her behavior.  If zombie effect happens_ we lower the does_ especially from school year to summer_ when she may not need to concentrate as much on task work.

Keeps me positive_ focused_ and level-headed.,I love this medicine. I have been taking it for 8 years and now_ even as an adult_ I do not wish to stop taking it. The days that I don't take it I feel depressed and unfocused and I eat constantly. The medicine helps me to stay concentrated. I graduated high school with a 4.0 GPA.

I was started on the low dose_ doc says he wants to monitor BP in 3 weeks and see where we stand. The first pill I took I could feel it going to my brain_ like a burning sensation up the back of the neck and skull_ haven't had that feeling since the first day. On the first day on this med_ I was manic but in a good way. Tons of energy_ talking non stop and cleaned my room spotless which I haven't done in over 6 months. I was also hyperaware of everything. Second day_ the effects weren't nearly as noticable_ in fact_ I don't feel it the same way anymore. I hardly feel anything to do with the meds.  It does however continue to take it's toll on my appetite_ which is fine with me because I gained 40 pounds over two years thanks to my thyroid gland. After it was removed due to cancer I gained another ten.  I had no idea I had ADHD until I did some research and the symptoms fit.

274, 3, ADHD,,I have experinced weird ways of thinking and what I call hyper focus_ its when you get so instensly focused on school work that you feel like you are using it as an escapism from dealing with real life. Smoking pot and being on concerta is not a good feeling I would recommend against it_ drinking on it is not to bad but you get really tired the next day. If you plan to do Ecxtasy you have to take more then you would orgionally think_ and do not do it while on the concerta. I feel that sadly smoking ciggarettes all day even thought it makes me tired helps me focus with my ADHD sometimes better then the concerta sometimes worse. I wonder if smoking cigarettes while being on birth control and concerta is bad for my heart though? It says alot that if you smoke you should be careful taking birth control and concerta is a stimulant too_ so it concerns me but I feel like there are no other options for what I can do right now.,F,17,9  years40mg 1X D,5/25/2010Email,Concerta

The biggest thing I've noticed has been insomnia.  I've been able to get maybe 3-5 hours of sleep for the past three nights after trying to get 8.  I ran a 10K today and am unable to nap.  I lay down and work as hard as I can to stop thinking and let myself drift into sleep_ but my mind continues to race.  My focused is increased_ yes_ but I am so anxious (side effect of the drug itself or the mental fatigue brought on by insomnia_ I'm not sure) I spend all my focus and energy trying to keep my thoughts in control.  It feels like someone's strapped a jet-engine to a tricycle.  It's too much power to control for me_ but I'm fairly certain this is because of the very very high dosage I'm on.  The mental fatigue and anxiety mixed with the enormous amount of mental firepower is like putting a howitzer in the hands of a drunk man.  Like I said_ I plan to lower my dosage.  I fear this will cut down on my raw mental horsepower (I took the ACT twice.

It's on the pharmacy printout_ the insert with the drug and ALL over the internet. Most ADULTS who are trying Concerta have tried other stimulants.  The side effects are all the same.  The suicidal thoughts and thoughts of harming yourself are the same for ADHD meds_ SSRIs_ MAOIs and Tri-Cyclics.  DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!!  It's ok to record your side effects_ but to say you didn't know is just ignorant.  READ THE INSERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  KNOW THE SIDE EFFECTS and LOOK for the SIGNS.  UGH_ unless you're illiterate there's no excuse!!!,F,35,0  days36 1X D,4/9/2010,Concerta

FYI- Body weight has a huge influence on dosage- I'm 6'4""_ 220 lbs.... down to 27 mg/day after I lost over 20 POUNDS from not craving sugar- I had a dependency for carbs and starchy foods due to the effect sugar has on the brain-it helps people with ADD/ADHD to concentrate temporarily- but now Concerta does it_ (for hours_ 6-9 on average) WITHOUT THE CALORIES!!! The whole world seemed to 'calm down' within 15 minutes of my first-ever dose_ and I haven't looked back. Communication with others is now even-paced_ the day doesn't seem so short and rushed now_ and socially I'm WAY more effective. Problem-solving is now clearer and more detailed_ without the panic or fear of not finishing the job...sound familiar? Also-I was the ""life of the party""-whether people wanted me to be or not- before Concerta_ but the difference is now I can involve myself socially with half the effort_ and still have an awesome time!!! And in all honesty_ and without overstating it_ Concerta saved my marriage and my relationship with my kids. I now have the patience to listen_ and not obsess with my own thoughts and compulsions taking over.....I told my siblings and family about this_ too- ADD/ADHD is an inherited trait_ and it definitely runs in the family_ so get involved_ and GET TESTED!!

I was taking 54 MG a day for a while and it was making me incredibly irritable_ rage-prone_ and wildly anxious. It also had a strange effect of giving me a series of facial tics. I've reduced my dosage to 27 MG every three days or so and that seems to work. But look_ THIS DRUG BUILDS UP IN YOUR SYSTEM so the effects are aggregate. I can't take it every day_ but tapered to once every three days and it seems to be fine. I'm alarmed at how angry this drug made me when taken regularly.

316, 3, ADD,The first day I took it (18mg - at around noon)_ I was up until 3am because I was so wired.  I had to wake up at 6am when I took another pill and functioned normally all day.  After a couple weeks_ I noticed this unreasonable anger building inside.  I spoke to my doctor about it and he upped the dose to 36mg I believe.  He told me that the beginning dose was to get my body used to it more gradually and that the anger was to be expected since the 18mg is usually a dose prescribed to younger kids.  I have been on this medication for about 3 years now.  Slowly_ at the max does of 54mg_ the anger is returning and I assume that it is because my body is becoming acclimated to it.  Also_ after all this time_ I am noticing that the stimulant effect when I first take it is virtually non-existent.  I've also noticed that I have become further anti-social (pre existing personality disorder traits are being amplified ten fold).,I am considering going off this medication because of the type that it is (stimulant).  I dread the thought of what I will be like as I go off of it and replace it with Stratera (which is a non-stimulant that works in about 70% of patients).

319, 4, ADHD,headache_ weight loss,it seems that many of these comments come from users or parents of users who are very uninformed about how this and other ADHD medications work. also its important to be aware that if there are other mental health problems simultaeously occuring one might have much more dramatic symptoms. if someone who was bi-polar was put on concerta he would most likely become manic_ irritable_ sleepless_ and have pronouced mood swings. personally_ it has worked well. you must be mature and self-aware enough to notice when you are being irrationally irritable or not eating properly. if that is too much to ask then it seems silly to be on this drug.,F,25,8  years,12/5/2009,Concerta

I thought more about what I was doing_ and I did not just say things that popped into my head. I learned a lot better and quicker_ and now maintain a 4.0. Concerta is great_ until you try and go to sleep at night. Laying in bed_ I will have severe anxiety and worries to the point where I cannot even fall asleep at night. Some of the things that I worry about are very unreasonable. I feel like I cannot stop my mind from slowing down at night. I usually do not fall asleep until around 2:00 a.m. even on school nights. It's so frustrating. When I worry_ or have severe anxiety_ I will start out with a small worry_ and then over a period of 5 minutes be worrying about a whole bunch of things at the same time.

326, 3, ADD,Lack of hunger_ spaced out feeling with too many thoughts_ and muscle tension.,I have been taking Concerta for quite sometime now and even though people complain that it doesnt work...they should really take into account that the dosage could be wrong. I learned at least with my own body that you have to adjust yourself to the medication. The first week I started taking it I ate almost nothing for a whole week. I lost twenty pounds. I alerted my doctor_ she lowered the dose and my body evened out. You really cannot say weather or not this medicine is working for someone based on their behaviors. THEY have to decide that on their own. Trust me they can tell if they are behaving differently. Concerta helps you think things through more. If someone wants to commit suicide or play with their hair or anyother behaviors that doesnt mean that the Concerta isnt working or it makes them think through it more. It is still their own decision to act on those thoughts. Be patient talk with your doctor and see what other possibilities are out there. And PARENTS talk with your kid about what they are feeling and thinking. Dont assume and dont judge. Medicines like this are serious so talk to your kid in a calm mature manor. Any questions feel free to ask.,M,19,3  years,10/28/2009Email,Concerta

I now have entered my 4th month and started recieving strange headaches. The pain can be described as a ""preasure feeling"" on top of head and the particular sensation is quite painful and can last from a day up to 3 to 4 days.

330, 1, ADD,listlessness_ loss of interest in anything_ unable to sit down for any period of time_ delusional thoughts,Although I was dealing with other things in my life_ I believe that Concerta is what ultimately led to my psychotic break.  I started at 36 mg_ and from the first day I took it_ I couldn't sleep at night.  My racing thoughts kept me up for hours_ and I couldn't stop thinking crazy thoughts in my head.  During the day_ I felt robotic.  I couldn't hold a conversation with any of my closest friends.  I would walk from room to room in my house_ and completely forget why I was there.  I showed no interest in tv_ books_ or the internet_ three of my favorite activities.  I completely isolated myself_ and was terrified of going back to school.  My heartbeat was so rapid_ I thought it would burst out of my chest.  I stopped taking it after a week_ and the awful side effects remained.  I returned to school_ and a week later I landed myself in the psych ward_ and had to take the semester off.  Eight months later Im myself again and perfectly happy_ but it took me a long time to get to this place.  I would not recommend this drug to anyone.  I temporarily lost my mind_ and in my opinion_ Concerta's not even worth trying it if it means risking your sanity.  If anyone is experiencing any similar side effects_ and would like to vent or ask questions_ feel free to email me at lad66@pitt.edu.,F,20,7  days,10/3/2009,Concerta
331, 4, adult ADHD,Slowing down of pretty much everything - this is a good thing// times stands still/ I walk/ drive/ talk more slowly/ at work I don't bark out orders like I used to/ difficulty sleeping - getting to sleep or falling back asleep if awakened/ no appetite/ increased sweating/ cold intolerance/ less desire for wine/ slight weepiness but I think at this point it's just being able to take so much more in - it's a bit overwhelming how much I didn't notice before.,My son was diagnosed with ADHD and started on meds at age 8 over a year ago - he's a tiny kid to begin with so the appetitie supression is an issue but he's up to 27 mg and it has helped sooooo much with school/ social/ hockey// he has some occasional inexplicable sadness and rare angry defiant outbursts but these happened before meds and were much worse. I was diagnosed simply by having a son who was just like his mom_ and I finally decided to try the meds. I am a nurse practitioner. It's too soon to predict anything long term but for now I'm impressed and I understand my son much better. As well I am so much calmer with him so there have been NO arguments with him since I started meds - insert lightbulb moment here. I'm on 45 mg. I think the trick is to just slightly undertreat rather than overtreat to avoid the side effects. It's not an easy thing.,F,45,8  days,9/25/2009,Concerta

I go through periods where I really feel as if it's helping me_ and then at other times I notice how it has changed me_ not always for the better either.  Anyway_ I have lost almost 30 pounds while taking concerta and have definitely noticed an increase in my ability to maintain my focus.  The problem is that this focus usually takes the form of a hyperfocus_ which means that family and friends are pushed aside.  Of course_ this leads to social isolation_ which only feeds the social anxiety effects of this drug that I eventually endure if and when I am in social situations. I would definitely say that this drug is effective_ but the way that it can affect thoughts_ mood_ and behavior is something to strongly consider if and when deciding whether or not you or your loved ones might benefit from it.,M,27,90  days,9/4/2009,Concerta

I have a bunch of side effects that are very uncommon_ but about 75% of those taking Concerta won't have any side effects at all.

351, 3, ADHD/ ODD,Severe mood swings and violent outbursts,My son was diagnosed with ADHD in Nov. 2008.  The doctor put him on concerta (18mg).  It worked instantly.  I was so happy.  He was not moving around in class he was able to concentrate.  It was a wonder drug.  Well in Feb.  the dosage was increased  to 27mg because of the length of the effectiveness did not get him through the day.  3 weeks later I noticed a change in him of mild moodiness.  at times he would have a temper tantrum.  In May the dosage was increased again_ now to 36mg.  Big mistake I think.  He became violent and distructive at school.  It even got to a point where he was physically abusive himself.  He bust his lip with a book and bled all down his mouth.  just yesterday he went bolistic in the mall to the point I had to call mall security to escort me back to my vehicle.  The psychitrist said it is not the concerta because the side effects would have been seen within 24 hours of the first dose back in Nov.  But to me there is no other explaination for his outburts.  He has never been violent like this.  I have a master's degree in psychology_ but I am currently teaching_ I feel helpless because I can't help my child.

At first I thought he was licking his lips but I noticed he was just moving his tongue back and forth and moving his mouth.  He even did this while talking_ which gave him the odd appearance of being in a badly-dubbed movie (mouth movements not matching the words coming out).  When I asked him if his mouth was dry he said ""no"".  He also complained of his stomach hurting him.  On Sunday_ 5/10/09_ we did not give him the Concerta and he did not have the facial tics at all but he did say his stomach hurt at one point during the day.

I am on 36mg. At first it was hard to sleep_ but everything evened out after 2 weeks. My mood is definitely better_ everything seems do-able!

It really controls him fidgeting and his concentration is so much better.  He does well in college_ but his loss of appetite is hard to deal with.

376, 5, ADD,Difficulty sleeping at night_ loss of appetite. (email me for my full story),"I'm 29 years old.  When I was younger I struggled desperately to stay organized and focused but failed.  My parents worked soooo hard to help me and my teacher's always said the same thing ""He is so smart_ if only he would focus""  or  ""He does great on tests but constantly forgets his homework"".  I always felt so different.  My backpack had cookie crumbs and crumbled paper.  It was dirty and I always forgot books_ and pens.  Everyone seemed so organized.. so perfect.  I wanted to be like them but no matter how hard I would try_ I would end up failing.  This brought on depression and sadness.  Especially in High School when my social life became complex.  At some point I decided to be the class clown.  I suppose_ if you can't beat your problem.. might as well use your wild and silly behavior to your advantage.  I got detentions and my parents were happy just to see D's and C's on my report cards.  Being so smart_ but struggling so hard was very frustrating for teachers and my parents.  Finally_ after many failed attempts I sat down with a psychologist provided by the school.  After quite a few sessions_ she diagnosed me with ADD.  My parents heard all of the bad things about Ritalin and the like.  They took me to the University of Chicago Hosptial and had me professionally tested for ADD.  After that_ it was off to a psychiatrist.  It was determined by both sources that I indeed had ADD.  I took Ritalin.  It made me focus.  It slowed the world down for me a",M,29,2  months,4/7/2009Email,Concerta

I felt it changed my personality in a negative way (argumentative_ less patient_ introverted_ moody_ grouchy) and produced negative habits which I have never experienced before (playing with fingertips_ etc.)  I was also concerned with the increased heart rate and blood pressure.

All of the side effects he has had have happened on different occasions but the Concerta is what keeps him awake at night he is so tired but can't sleep. He also has no appetite.

When I was  in elementary school_ the teachers would put me in a desk in the corner with a cardboard box around it so I wouldn't get distracted(didn't work). Concerta has helped my ability to focus.  It does cut appetite (makes you feel full) and I've lost 10 pounds because of it. I was underweight to begin with so this raised some concerns. It does make you dizzy for the first few days and if you skip a few days and then start taking it again the dizziness returns. My doctor first prescribed me 36 mg and then switched to 54 mg. I take the 36 over the week end so that I'm not dizzy when I go back to school. I've been having some mood swings. Crying   one moment_ screaming in anger the next. I've been feel depressed lately_ but I'm not sure if that is just situational or a side effect as I've been under quite a bit of stress lately.

I only took this dose for 1 day. I did not notice any improvement in my ADD symptoms. Instead I had a headache all day and  felt irritable. Unfortunately_ Concerta is not a magic pill. What I do to help myself plays a big role in my treatment. I've been researching CBT and NCT_ putting into practice what I think may be helpful for me.

Which is nice because before I couldn't concentrate in class or sit down to work on homework for long periods of time. I have never felt this eager to learn. However_ the side effects are awful. I got irritated easier and started to snap at people. My stomach was hungry because it wouldnt stop growling but my head told me I wasnt. The loss of sleep was the worst for me...The first night I didnt even go to sleep. Also_ I kind of felt like I was moving in slower motion. But for the first few hours_ I got work done and concentrated.,F,18, ,3/27/2008,Concerta
469, 5, Adult ADD/ADHD,The good stuff: increased motivation and self- confidence educationally_ more focused_ less fatigue_ less frequent instances of racing thoughts_ way more productive with my busy schedule_ etc.Side effects: Decreased appetite_ dry mouth_ increased thirst and urination_ frequent insomnia (likely self-provoked with caffeine and taking too late in the day)_ excessive underarm sweating at times_ heart pounding_ smoke more ciggarettes_ reverse effects with alcohol.,"I am very happy with the benefits of Concerta. SOMETIMES when it first kicks in I may have excessive underarm sweating_ clammy hands that may be a little shaky_ which wears off. However_ I also have not given up my undying love for coffee_ which by itself can cause that. It also depends on the amount of sleep I've had. I do have frequent late nights and even insomnia_ but I can be in bed before midnight if taken early and limit my caffeinated beverages. I am motivated and actually enjoy studying. I've always been considered ""smart"" but lacked the attention and motivation to even read a page in a book without starting something else. I used to have racing thoughts all the time_ and couldn't even concentrate on listening in lectures_ or even while having a conversation. I went fluctuating grades (2.6-3.6 GPA) to a steady 3.46 and above_ having Professors use me as an example_ without even a struggle. I don't 'party' nearly as much_ but I don't consider that a bad thing. Saves m",F,23,2  years,3/21/2008,Concerta

I switched to taking 54 mg of Concerta every morning_ deffinetly noticed my concentration improve. After the first day using Concerta i was unable to fall asleep that night and ended up staying awake till i had to go to school again. I took my 54 mg's that next morning just so i would be able function in school that day. That night i had trouble falling asleep but ended up getting about 4 hours in. Today i took another 54 mg's in the morning and am feeling quite depressed and irritable at the moment.I realize that different medications treating ADD/ADHD will have significantly different effects on one individual over another. . . this drug just isn't for me i guess,M,17,4  days,3/13/2008,Concerta

My GPA has gone up dramatically and I am motivated to participate in many more extracurricular activities. For the first time in my life_ I am having erectile problems. I went off the drug last summer and had no problems whatsoever but now for no reason I can think of_ 2/3 of the time I lose my erection just as I suit up. This is incredibly frustrating to myself and my girlfriend_ and I can't think of any other reason why this should be occurring.

I didn't even know this was possible. But after taking Concerta for a week now he's been doing GREAT! Suddenly his homework is nice and neat (whereas before it was correct_ but practically unreadable). He is no longer squirming in his seat or invading other's personal space. He's listening to his teachers! It's amazing! He takes the lowest dose even though he was diagnosed with a moderate to severe case of ADHD. By 4pm he starts to return to his busy self_ but even at that point he seems a bit more in control. So far this drug is a miracle!

This has been the most bothersome side effect; some mild jitteryness,"I've suspected I had ADD all my life (it's rampant in our extended family)_ and this summer an adult friend made a strong case for Concerta. The drug has helped me not de-rail so much in conversation_ or panic that my mind has gone out to lunch while the other person is talking. It's a bit like a caffeine kick_ though_ and I can't have any caffeine in addition during the day. Another benefit is that I've always struggled with compulsive overeating_ and probably because of the appetite suppressant in this medication_ I am now able (after the first three days of not being hungry at all) to stick to a reasonable eating plan and intentionally lose weight. It's the first time I ever felt like a ""normal"" eater.  The dry mouth side effect is annoying enough for me to think about going off it altogether; the fear of regaining weight and getting sluggish mentally keeps me on it.

The DR's said that he had childhood schizophrenia and that the hallucinations were not caused by the stimulants. They added Risperdal to his diet of drugs and he developed severe tardive dyskinesia which he still suffers from 7 years later. The hallucinations went away when he went off of the stimulants_ the TD remains. Two years ago_ the FDA finally came out saying that these stimulants can cause hallucinations. It is a money market_ the pharmacy companies have their hands deeply tucked in to the politician's pockets. I had three boys on stimulants.

She is listening_ turning her work in on time_ her concentration has impoved and we are getting positive reports from her teacher.  I do hope her appetite returns as she does not eat hardly at all during the day and is really hungry about bedtime. Concerta is working so much better that Stratera did. She has had a few more headaches that usual but they do not last long. I really hope we have found a way to control her ADD.,F,8,1  months,9/6/2007,Concerta

It scared me - terribly!!!!",My son has had oppositional behaviors as well hyper excitability for as long as I can remember. At first the doctor prescribed Rispiradol for the ODD. That did not work so we paid 120.00 for a 30 day supply of the 18mg Concerta. He took it at 8am the first day and by 1pm he was having trouble keeping his tongue in his mouth and his jaw was twitching back and forth. By 4pm I called the pharmacy who said take him to the emergency if it did not stop by 9pm. We went to emerg by 9:30 and was told to stop giving it to him_ and he was given Benedryl!

At this point_ I have seen a remarkable improvement in her ability to focus on her work and even to become a successful multi-tasker.  Her grades have improved from a low 'C' average to a 'B' average.  You have to stay on top of this drug however.  She started at 18mg which didn't do anything_ then went up to 36mg.  This gave her a big boost_ but after about 2 weeks she became very sad and said that she ""just felt empty"".  Naturally concerned_ we had the dosage readjusted to 27mg.

If there is any one else who is on this medicine who is hypoglycemic_ I'd recommend buying a blood glucose monitor to keep an eye on your glucose levels. the medicine seems to intensify the symptoms of hypo.once i started monitoring my blood glucose_ i could see a direct coralation between some of my mentioned side effects and my sugar level(always low when side effects are a bit too much).since the medication suppresses the appetite_ I found it VERY important to force myself to snack all day(every 2 hours or so to maintain somewhat of a proper b.g. level. It definitely took some of the edge off the side effects.And since glucose is the ONLY fuel your brain uses_maintaining proper levels seem to help the med. work better. Hope this will be useful to atleast a few people.,M,31,2  months,3/31/2007Email,Concerta
558, 5, ADHD - my son age 10,Increase in appetite_ slight increase in thirst_ occassional mood swings_ little bit of difficulty falling/staying asleep.,I think Concerta is wonderful.  My son is ADHD and his hyperactivity made the Energizer Bunny look lazy.  He used to  always be in trouble at school_ grades were nearly failing_ the teacher/principal were always calling to complain_ no one at school would be his friend.  He's been on Concerta for 2 years and we've seen more positives than negitives.  The teacher rarely calls_ his grades have improved_ he laughs more since he's not always in trouble_ when I take him to school I hear kids calling out his name to say 'hi' or to say 'come on' and off he runs...he has friends now! He still has mood swings occassionally and can become very angry_ but temperment doesn't just come from adhd_ it also comes from parents.  With calm talking_ lots of praise and reenforcement of rules with  structured non-physical discipline he is getting better at that.  At the beginning we had the problem with him not sleeping_ but we fixed that by doing his homework immediately after school and then sending him,F,36,2  years,3/28/2007Email,Concerta

564, 5, ADD (inattentive),"No negative side effects. After 35 years of undiagnosed ADD_ I finally can experience life without distractions.  Have tried Strattera_ Wellbutrin_ Adderall XR and Focalin XR -- Concerta BY FAR has done the trick for me.  Able to focus for a good 8-9 hrs.  Sadly_ after that time has passed_ I go into ""a funk"" and often wander around aimlessly (browsing the internet with no specific purpose_ watching TV for a good 10 minutes before it occurs to me that I haven't turned it on (hahaha!)_ takes an hour to clean 5 minutes worth of dishes_ and just feel a low sense of accomplishment with tasks).  I have taken 56mg as late as 5pm and was sleeping like a baby by 10:30p.  It doesn't make me feel jittery_ IF ANYTHING-- it really calms me down.  Which is an irony-- How A STIMULANT can calm a person down.  I also have had panic attacks since a young child and am taking 100mg of Zoloft for this.  I couldn't be happier with the way that I feel and my ability to focus and complete tasks (as","There is so much 'negative' talk about stimulants and how they should be 'outlawed.'  Unfortunately_ I don't believe such critics are going through the issues that those with A.D.D. are.  If a person has cancer_ arthritis_ even a toothache--such ones will get sympathy because others can imagine what such an ailment would be like.  But_ when the primary OUTWARD symptoms of an A.D.D.'er is ""lazy_ mindless_ flighty_ cannot stay on task_ all over the place_ etc.""_ there isn't any sympathy to be found (nor does it look very good on a resume`).  Parents are told they aren't disciplining their children properly if their kids have A.D.D... and adults never quite measure up to their full potential and SADLY--may never know why (if undiagnosed).  There are_ indeed_ reasons NOT to take these types of medications_ but when the results of 'untreated a.d.d.' are added to the equation_ the reasons for getting a.d.d. cared for FAR OUTWEIGH leaving it to the wind.",M,36,9  months,2/1/2007Email,Concerta

Of course_ the Dr. said it was not related to the ADHD medication.  He is now 11 and still on Tegretol to control the petite-mal (partial) seizures.  His neurologist said this type of seizure should go away once his brain in more developed.  He is doing o.k. w/out medication - academics would probably be better on medication (A's instead of B's or C's) but it's not worth it to us.

604, 4, add,Headaches_ sinus pressure_,I started taking concerta about 3 months ago and it started great_ like an energy boost that also gave me a sharper focused mind. For a while I thought it stopped working. But then I realized it wasnt going to do all the work for me. I focused my mind while on it and learned to channel my mind. Concerta definitely helped me do this. My motivation levels practically double while on it to boot.

605, 4, add,Headaches_ sinus pressure_,I started taking concerta about 3 months ago and it started great_ like an energy boost that also gave me a sharper focused mind. For a while I thought it stopped working. But then I realized it wasnt going to do all the work for me. I focused my mind while on it and learned to channel my mind. Concerta definitely helped me do this. My motivation levels practically double while on it to boot.

I take Lithium for bipolar disorder_ and I was also taking Dexadrine.  However_ Dexadrine was a challenge to remember twice a day and Concerta solved this problem.  Much clearer concentration_ my mood swings (I rapid cycle) have levelled out immensely.  Irritability is decreased.   I am having difficulty with vision and am trying to pin down when it started.  My menstrual cycle is out of wack now and I'm pretty sure that it is related to Concerta.  Will be doing research and talking to my physician.,F,38,3  months,7/31/2006,Concerta

Really helped me focus though. I got off of it probably 9 months later. Withdrawl was HORRIBLE! I felt like I had a hangover times 10. Now_ I've started taking it again (18mg). It has helped me remember things and made me more tollerable to my family_ but I feel ""out of it"" and alittle more depressed than usual... I'm pretty shy_ but on Concerta_ I could just sit for hours and think. I'm also more tired. I don't have much energy_ but I am more motivated to do things that I know need to get done.

Everything was so lucid_ everything_ even the hardest questions made perfect sense and I was able to focus so much better. The strange part was that I was able to see the world slower at will ex.: cars seemed slower_ people walked slower. It was very strange and I liked it.

Dr's recommended meds to help him focus.  He took ritalin with okay results_ helped him focus but he withdrew and became very timid and quiet_ not wanting to play outside or seek friends out_ I thought this was just his personality that he was just a loner.  We then tried a time release formula_ started concerta about 2 months ago and his anxiety quadroupled.  He worried_ and obsessed about the smallest things_ he had no tolerance for his siblings_ he was just not a happy child.  At first I thought this was just his personality but a couple of days in a row I forgot to give him his pill and realised he was in a really good mood.  The third day gave him his Concerta again and he was a nervous wreck.  Since_ we have stopped the Concerta and started  giving him a St Johns Wort supplement_ he is like a different child.  Happy_ talkative_ more energy for life.  Don't know if  St. Johns Wort will help him  concentrate any better but I'd rather have a happy lively child than watch him be drained of his personality by the concerta.

688, 4, ADD,Effects during: anxiety_ agitation_ rapid heartbeat_ loss of appetite.  Effects when drug wears off: paranoia_ moodiness_ sleep deprivation_ depression (I don't understand how some people list depression under reasons- it just adds to it).  Other effects: addiction and dependence; days without Concerta I feel are spent wasted doing nothing productive,Despite the extreme side-effects experienced_ I rated Concerta a 4 simply because it works as a stimulant; it keeps me focused inside and out of the classroom_ and I'm driven to work and keep working until the drug begins to wear off some 8-10 hours later. A workaholic zombie_ with little emotion or boredom to get in the way of getting tasks done. Once the intended effects wear off_ the emotion will hit me like a ton of bricks_ and depression and paranoia will set in. Usually_ I counter this with a mild tranquilizer in the evenings to force myself to relax or sleep during this period. I'm a graduating college senior_ dual majoring in both mathematics and computer science- I honestly don't think I could have pulled this off without the help of Concerta.

For a long time it seemed to work very well and my side effects were anxaity_ headaches_ tremors_ social withdrawal_ sleeping problems_ paranoia_ and the like but not very serrious at first.  Even the first couple of months on 20mg was ok.  And it did help my grades a lot_ by allowing me to actually concentrate.  But as time went on_ I became very intolerant of Ritalen.  In 10th grade the anxaity attacks were pretty nasty_ and thats when social witherdrawal really started to kick in.  In 11th grade some terrible stuff started happening-when I started driving to school in the morning_ I would constantly check the backseat of the blazer to make sure no one was there.  And this was before the drug took effect.  Even though I rationally knew that no one was back there_ I drove wildly because I thought it would keep them off balance.  Thats when I knew I had a problem_ but I really thought I needed Ritalen to complete school.  After the side effects came to a head midway through my senoir year I could no longer handle the paranoia and anxaity so I told my family that I was no longer taking ritalen.  I was a 4.0 student at that time and my mother told me if I did that_ then I would be a total failure at school.  I did it anyways and I graduated with a 4.0.  When I stopped_ I agreed that I would try concerta for a while_ but I would decide if I would take it regularly.  When I stoped taking ritalen_ most of the side effects went away except for the paranoia_ although it was greatly migitated.  I now take a 54 mg concerta_ and although I still get the same side effects_ at least they are not so intense and distrubing.  In HS I would run and lift weights to allievate the stress (that funny feeling in my chest disappeared pernamently after a couple weeks of running_ and stays away as long as I continue to exersize) and focusing on certain things would stop the paranoia.  I wonder if I have outgrown my add but am not sure how to find out.  I hate this drug_ but can't leave home without it.Oh_ and sometimes I feel like god.  I think I can do anything_ but I can supress that.,M,19,7  years,2/9/2005Email,Concerta

The rest of the day I felt dizzy_ nautious and sick. When the medicine started to wear off my right hand would shake. I spent most of the day focused on how I was feeling_ rather than concentrating on school work and things I was supposed to be concentrating on. After doing some research online and finding out that these were common side affects of CONCERTA_ I told my doctor and have been on ADERRALL since. So far there have been no problems with ADERRALL other that difficulty falling asleep_ and I've found that I have much more of an appetite than I did with CONCERTA.,F,16,2  weeks,1/6/2005,Concerta

My classes are huge_ so without the medication_ I was constantly over-whelmed and over-stimulated.  I have suffered with migraine headaches_ stomach problems_  muscle tension problems_ and high blood pressure for years.  Since taking Concerta_ I have noticed a significant decrease in all of these conditions.  I feel like I can turn off all the channels and noise and get to the point quicker.  I'm also much less impulsive; I don't interrupt or finish other peoples' thoughts.  I still have symptoms and always will. It would be incredibly naive to think any medication will be   100%.  I'm grateful it's on the market w/limited side effects.,F,43,3  months,12/29/2004,Concerta
705, 2, Contol the syptoms of ADHD,SIDE EFFECTS:1) Feeling of being stimulated in that can't start the engine in a traffic jam (feeling unsettled and alert almost in the direction of panic just enough to be uncopmftable!!) kind of way for the whole day!!! 2) Inability to relaxe (body perminantly tense (causes me to smoke Heavily).3) Can focuss on a task better_ but am to stressed to sit and work as a result of this medication.4)Leads to gradual depression therefore requires withdrawl from drug to correct this.5) Can't perform socially as I usally can. Takes some effort!6) Can't eat leads to bad eating habbits!7) Can't sleep leads to body clock being out of order!,The drug:1) Increased my attention span_ but increased my stress level which canceled out the achivment here!2) The one succesful outcome for me is that this drug makes me think more clearly about my actions and what I say_ it makes me less impulsive and thats the one great thing. However pretty sure Im going to have to come off it now! I am a second year Physics student at uni.,M,25,1  years,12/29/2004Email,Concerta
706, 1, ADD/HD,My six year old son seem to be having problems concentrating. So his pediatrician recommended concerta. After taking the drug for 28 days_ he suddenly starting pulling his hair out (tricotomosis). During this time his eyes were glossy and he lost him appetite. He became VERY violent. He literally jumped on me and starting punching me. He had terrible stomach pains. I thought we would have to commit him to a mental hospital.  Thankfully_ the pediatriciam recommended a psychiatrist_ who quickly diagnosed my son as NOT be ADD/HD. He just had a discipline problem. We took him off the medicine and he began behavorial modification. One month_ later he is a different child!!,,M,7,28  days,12/29/2004Email,Concerta

719, 5, Severe ADD & dyslexia,Deprest_ shaky_ sick_ not hungry_ sleeplessness_ with draw_,I took ridalin when i was about 7 till about 14 all tho i really don't remember much of it but my parents still strugled with my learning problems. Now that im on concerta I feel focused and can sit and do a project and WANT to finish it. the problem is i WANT to finish it so bad i will be late for school_ work_ or other activites. Last winter i was diagnosed with depreshion and social anxiety and was put on zoloft.      During the summer i decided not to take my concerta because i wasnt in school. As soon after i stopped my concerta my siciatrist said my depression was lifting up and i felt so much more happy. I hung out with friends and even had a boy friend my self image seemed to improve in my eyes. I didnt make the connection and thought it was the zoloft and all the hours spent in councling. Now that Im out of councling and in school taking my concerta I realize now that I'm depressed and with drawed i feel like i cant talk to anyone and avoid my friends as much as possible. I love my school and want to go there but the fear of people and social scares me more then ever now. I can feel the side effects of the concerta dirasticly now Im shaky all the time and feel sick from time to time I know i should eat but the thought of food sickens me and most of all even tho i take my concerta very early in the morning around 7am I still cant sleep before 2am still im not tired when i wake up.    But over all the concerta really helps me read if i forget a day i sit in school looking at the clock and drawing pictures. my days seem like years and reading is 10 times as hard and i have to read things over and over. So sometimes the side effects are worth the out come of concerta.,F,17,3.5  years,8/27/2004Email,Concerta

I wouldn't say that I'm more Violent_ but I can defanetly feel myself working harder to make Rational decisions.  But the most frightening of them all happend within the last couple days.

If I can learn how to master my thoughts well enough I don't really see a problem with it aside from the loss of apetite and the constant need for liquids.

I have noticed my memory is somewhat sharper this short into it and I have a better ability in public speaking because I can hold one train of thought.  Heck_ I can hold several trains of thoughts which is amazing.

722, 1, ADHD,,However_ after almost an hour of this escapade_ it got to a point where I started to think about what was really going on.  I very fast realized that there was no way in hell that what I had made up was real.  There wasn't anything realistic of what I was thinking or dramatizing out.  I started to calm down and it was as if I just awoke from a nightmare with someone chasing me.  I've never had any kind of experience such as this_ and want to know what could be contributing factors to it-  I'm still unsure.  I have Dizziness_ headaches_ and sweat a good amount regardless of the temperature.  One thing I do notice is that I do some things in repetition. Some over and over and over again_ like walking back in forth in my living room or walking to the door for the sole purpose of locking it because I don't want an intruder.  Checking my peep hole because I think there is someone out there.  All the while my physical body is doing this_ Im having a huge battle of wits in my head_ and Im thinking about so many different things and unlike when I'm not using concerta I can and do focus on not just one but several thoughts going on at once.  I think maybe the problem at hand could be that not only am I focusing on the realistic answer (none of these feelings and emotions are warranted by anything valid) but the simple fact that Im also focusing on a large amount of other things.  I feel like my mind is operating way over what it usually does_ and in results this is what happens.  Is this caused by stress?  Is it eating habits?  I don't know_ but Id like to; anyone?,M,22,2  weeks,8/23/2004Email,Concerta

Because of this I suffered greatly all the way through school and through adulthood. I always wanted to do better but had to study so hard in school just to get mid level grades. In adult hood I had a hard time with daily living and became major depressed where I could no longer work. The Concerta has helped me get my life back in order. Next week I will start working again for the first time in over 2yrs. The Concerta started to work instantly and have not noticed or felt any side effects.
