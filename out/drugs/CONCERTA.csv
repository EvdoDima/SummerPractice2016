0, 5, ADD,Insomnia on days I've taken concerta too late_ loss of appetite_ minor headaches,Probably the best tablet I have ever come across. I can plan my day and get hours of studying done. Boosts my confidence when I'm writing tests or exams.Also have enough energy and concentration to perform well at work.,M,24,2  years36mg 1X D,8/5/2016Email,Concerta
1, 4, ADD,do not drink alcohol with it or you'll regret it in the morning you'll want to die and you'll most certainly feel that sh** for more than a day and you're body will hurt like a bitch for some reason _ at least mine did !!! Whatever it is _ don't drink and take it _ just a horrible idea with horrible consequences following ..,I loved it _ helped me focus continued to work better each time and made me feel like a million bucks I'd say it helped get rid of some of my anxieties and depression too with the right amount and it was nice for a change considering nothing else has worked for me but concerta does me good I guess !  also_ do not recommend for addicts because you will get hooked fast and take way too many leading up to a certain point cuz it is a great way to speed out but not what it's meant for and could really harm you . trust me I tried it and than ended up taking it only for the right reason and it works just fine for me now. And as I said before no alcohol with it once agajn_ it's just a risk not worth taking_ especially with the hard liquors such as Malibu _ Bacardi _ Whiskey or anything of the type !,F,16,5  days54 mg,8/1/2016Email,Concerta
2, 3, Adult ADD/Depression,Since it generally was to help w/my Focus & Concentration_ it would work :) However_ it'd make me jittery_ fast heartbeat & headache... Recently (past month) the headaches have increased from being Mild & Manageable to now being Moderate & Irritating. Also_ nausea set in 2-3wks ago & just last week began the nausea followed by vomiting :(,*This rating is my 'current stint w/Concerta_ tho took it B4_ years ago* -- Take it AS PRESCRIBED (for all U addicts out there)!

5, 3, Depression/overweight from other Rx,I lost a lot of weight on this med_ nearly 50 pounds. It super jacked up my metabolism. I went from size 18 to size 10 fast. On the down side I couldn't stop the dry mouth no matter what I did/used. I actually got 'meth mouth' and my teeth broke and crumbled. My dentist tried hard to save them but after 2 years I had ALL of my teeth pulled and now wear dentures. A sad outcome.,It made me thin_ made my hair thin too. Lost my teeth. The doctor who put me on this med never warned me about what could happen. It's one thing to say on the package it causes dry mouth but the FDA should make them warn this could lead to tooth loss_ which in my case it did!,F,55,2  years30mg,6/24/2016,Concerta

7, 2, ADD,I am sensitive to EVERY medication_ and always get the weirdest side effects.  I liked Concerta ok for my ADD_ but the side effects were not worth it.  I was constantly bloated and my digestion was not good while on this medication.  When I increased my dose from 36mg to 54mg_ the digestive distress increased and I developed a major fungal infection. Had to take Diflucan to combat it.  My voice was also getting more hoarse.  I recommend the medication because of the effectiveness of keeping me focused_ but could not tolerate the side effects.,,F,45,45  days54 mg 1X D,6/20/2016,Concerta

10, 1, For college and work,Loss of appetite_ depressed_ anxiety_ acne_ fast heart beat_ nausea,I started taking concerta for school about two years ago. I am currently trying to be done with it. It gives me horrible acne. It makes me depressed and have horrible anxiety. Which makes me smoke ciggerates which if I don't take the medication i can't stand the smell of them. I have never been so depressed in my life. It helped me in school but I can find other ways to concentrate. It gives me head aches and make me nauseous in the morning. I have a three year old and if I take my meds I have to wait till I come down to even be social with him. Cooking for him when I take it makes me sick to my stomach. I get head aches here and there. It's the devil stay away find alternative ways to coup with everyday task. Also any loud noises like music loudly irrates me and i just want to be left alone in my room plus it makes me feel tired but can't sleep.,F,24,2  years36,3/19/2016,Concerta
11, 3, Diagnosed ADHD,at the start (Fatigue_ tiredness_ change in appetite_ loss of weight),I was taking Concerta XL when I was 14-16 to improve my concentration at school. I was being sent out of classes a lot and was generally a really rude person.  At the start_ I noticed that my appetite had changed a lot_ I was also crying a lot to begin with. After about 4 months I had lost a fair amount of weight. I had noticed that my appetite started to pick up_ but instead of me eating junk food (like I usually would) I would start to eat healthier foods? Which seemed a little odd. I believe this medication does work_ I managed to go from getting E's and D's in most of my GCSE's to passing them all with C's and B's. However_ I do believe that you need to want to change/help yourself for this medication_ like all medications_ to become effective. I'm now at University and I find it hard to believe that a few years ago I was failing mostly everything and didn't know what I'd be doing later in life. Also_ i think it is important to identify that I also applied myself more. So if you're prescribed this medication_ you also need to work with it for it to benefit you.  I hope this information is beneficial for anybody who is reading.,M,22,2  years30mg 1X D,3/16/2016,Concerta
12, 3, improve my concentration at school.,Weightloss_decreased appetite.(but i also get extremely hungry)_ irritation_ depression_ blurred vision_ insomnia_ anxiety.,From the age of 12 till 17 i took about 54mg of concerta daily. Iam now im my final year in high school_ ive been taking 100mg due to the increased amount of work at school. Ive never till today felt so depressed_ my confidence in down the drain_ i no longer want to play netball or go to school dances. I feel that i dont have a personality_ im constantly very quiet and reserved. Its gotten so bad that i fear of leaving my room at boarding school and if i do i make sure i come back asap. I easily feel intimidated and im always thinking that im not good enough. Concerta does help me concentrate_ i do one thing at a time and im very patient. Weirdly my hearing has improved tremendously_ for example; im able to hear when someone is walking down the passage quiet a distance away. When im studying and concentrating really hard_ ill tune in to the sound of someone crunching a paper or drawing with a pencil on the other side of the room and get extremely irrated or if a clock ticks ill stare at it for a long time (hoping that it will stop). Judging from my marks at school_ concerta has helped me alot. But the way i feel about myself now_regarding my self esteem and doing things at school or anywhere_ i wouldnt want anyone to feel like this. Yes i have been to a psychologist many times_ but honestly it doesnt help. I feel i cant go without concerta. Actually my body is dependent on it_ i can immediately feel when i havent taken it_ i feel almost tipsy and i struggle to speak properly_,F,17,7  years100mg,2/13/2016Email,Concerta

14, 5, ADHD,Cold and/or sweaty extremities.  Loss of appetite.  Trouble sleeping.Trouble staying hard during sex.,I have been taking concerta fror 11 years and have gone through numerous dosage changes and even stopped and restarted the drug.  From my experience this drug works well to increase concentration_ focus_  and attention.  Helps me do one thing at a time without jumping from task to task.  Slso this supresses my appetite which has helped me maintain normal weight.,M,19,10  years54,2/12/2016,Concerta

18, 4, ADHD,I didn't feel that I experienced any of the side effects of concerta apart from loss of appetite and a few minor things but things that have happened in the past few days have made me realise that I a lot of things about me have changed but not all of them are for the best I now feel like I have lost the real me a little like I have lost my personality and I have noticed that my confidence to do things and self confidence has dropped huge amounts I don't do anything or try anything if I think someone will have something to say about it I fear that if I try letting go and be myself that I will lose friends and people won't like me I don't try any thing new anymore even things to do with myself like new styles because of fear of being judged and fear that people won't like it_ I don't even like expressing my opinion and get nervous when I think I've done some that people won't like and I know my real personality is nothing like that_ I feel dependant on concerta and actually fear trying a different medication or coming off of medication as if I'm afraid of the real me and my real personality. I am sharing this just to make people think about what it's actually effecting about yourself and don't just look for the named side effects like loss of appetite and and stuff look at yourself and how you've changed but don't get me wrong over the years I have been taking concerta it hasn't all been negative_ my graves in school went from E's - D's to B's - A*'s and I am now studying at c,at college_ passing all of my assessments I also stopped fighting and I had been known throughout school for fighting. Look at the way it has changed you not just the way it has changed you body and don't just look for the side effects that have names like for example if you have started feeling down after you start taking concerta don't just think ahh it's nothing don't look at the side effects and see depression and think well my low mood must just be me_ is just me_ it's not the medication because I'm not depressed and that's what the side effect associated with your mood is called. I hope me sharing this will help at least a few people.,M,16,4  years72 mg,2/2/2016Email,Concerta

21, 3, ADD,I can attest to what your son is experiencing: cold (feet and hands)_ heart discomfort or at least an irregular feeling_ as well as anxiety when comming off the medication. As a 200lbs man on a 18mg daily dose I can imagine what the effects would be for a smaller boy.

22, 3, my son has adhd,Since my son has been on concerta he been complaining Bout chest pain_ being cold and been getting muscle spam. I had to drop him from 36mg to27mg. The doctor states his symptoms are not related to concerta_ but since I drop his dosage some of his symptom have been reduce. He gets headaches nausea_ dizzyness and his vison blurr_ and the worse muscle spam. I ask my doctor to change his medication and he was not willing to. So I am going in for a second opinion. For some reason doctors do not want to report serious side effects of concerta. It helps him concentrate but has a lot of side effects.

Most of the time when im on concerta_ i feel almost emotionless. Also_ if i stop taking concerta for one day after taking it for a long period of days_ i get very high levels in confidence and happiness.,Besides all the negatives_ concerta has helped me concentrate much better_ making me feel like if i have homework_ that i will just do it with out any distractions and it has helped me to cope better with working and focusing on school work_ in class with noisy_ disruptive classmates.,F,16,3  years27mg,11/25/2015,Concerta

27, 4, ADD,Fast heart rate_ anxiety_ easily annoyed attitude_ and loss of appetite.,Concerta helps me to focus more and stay on task. I am an outgoing and social person_ even on concerta. However_ on concerta I sometimes refrain myself from socialzing at times that I normally would. My first year taking concerta I lost 19 pounds in the first three months at 18mg. After I became more immune to the pill_ my dosage went up to 56mg. I have gained the weight back_ although in muscle since I am an athlete. If you are an athlete and take concerta_ know that while you are playing in a game you may feel like you are about to throw up sometimes. This is due to your loss of appetite in lunch and since you didn't take in much energy from the little food you have eaten_ the acidity in your stomach causes you to have a strong gag reflex. Also_ after going a day without eating on the pill and exercising_ you should hydrate because you will become dehydrated on top of being starved and will become easily annoyed by everything around you. Overall_ concerta has helped me maintain good grades and stay organized.,F,14,2  years56mg,11/21/2015,Concerta
28, 2, ADD,Irritability_ anxiety_ self-conciousness_ social anxiety_ appetite-loss_ loss of control_ depression_ insomnia_ migraines_ discomfort.,I took concerta when I was 13 and am currently taking it at age 15 (against my will). Concerta was very helpful for me in the ways of focusing on tasks_ getting things done_ and paying attention in class; but it caused irrational worry and a very high heart rate. It made me extremely tense and uncomfortable physically_ and also very self-concious about everything about myself. I became an outcast and had no friends. I was afraid to do anything for fear of judgement_ and my personality was lost as I became quiet and withdrawn socially. I did stop taking it for one year last year_ and socially and emotionally my life was so_ so much better_ but my grades and focus plummeted. At the beginning of this year however_ I entered high school (at grade 10) and my grades were worse than before and I was falling behind in everything_ so I was back on Concerta. I recommend finding another medication for ADD/ADHD. I would be trying something different if I could.,F,15,1  years36MG,11/3/2015Email,Concerta

30, 4, ADHD,GOOD: the ability to concentrate and focus on a specific subject at a time. Increased patience and willingness to do long activities such as reading or homework. Created empathy towards others and general calmness. I can think of things before i do or say them and usually have better judgement. Reduces hunger which can make you drink more water or pick healthier foods. More serious_ i generally just want to accomplish stuffBAD: dry mouth_ lack of appetite_ difficulty in being social with others_ less able to joke around with my friends since i have no humour_ feel like im depressed_ hard time sleeping_ harder to talk to girls and my friends say im boring when i do take it.,Mind you_ I am at this point still 17 and my thoughts of good or bad may be wrong or simply change within the future.

32, 5, Adhd,My only negative is that the doctors don't really tell you how to take the medicine and the insurance companies along with the doctors don't feel the need to require n provide us with nutritionists. I can go on n on about this but after reading everyone's complaints most of them are totally correctable if we were provided with more serious instructions n a nutritionist. For example if I take my concerta 10 minutes past 9:15 I will be up_ full functional n productive all day n night long. Or how some of us become extremely sensitive to sugar n that it should be avoided at all costs. All it takes is one experience to realize. Or how extremely important protein is for us n how we need to be having what is at least 10 grams every 3-4 hours. Once you have one bad,Experience I can promise you will never make that mistake again. For me it impairs all of my senses to the point I can't visually or audio recognize my own father if he was standing in front of my talking to me. I am unable to speaker cause my toung curls up n you can forget my ability to  comprehend a thing. N it is a very slow recovery. If that happens around 1 or 2 o'clock I am done for the day. I need to go hm n relax for the rest of the day. Normally I don't even want to drive anywhere. The harder I make my concerta wk for me the more I need to monitor my protein intake. If you are pron to depression you should have a pet..a dog_ cat_ bird_ horse_ etc. oh n you never take concerta with other medicine_  exercise enhancement type stuff_ or vitamins n not eat with in  absolute  max 30 minutes! Excercise n eating healthy can help you decrease your dose a little. Omega 3 n caffeine without sugar  enhances your medicine. N when studying if you take a short break..a complete mind break every 5 minutes your ability to retain info is  absolutely beyond mind blowing! It will bring tears to your eyes. I even try to carry emergency protein in my purse n car.,F,41,11  years72 1X D,9/29/2015,Concerta
33, 4, Adhd,Extreme weight loss_ irrability_ weakness_ headaches,I have pretty bad adhd and was prescribed Concerta in May. I started with 18mg which didn't help too much. Then went to 36mg and didn't help either and now I'm at 54mg and it helps wiTh concentrating in class. I took it in May and June then stopped over the summer. 4 weeks into taking it I lost my appetite and lost 10 pounds. Over the summer I gained the weight back. Beginning of September (3 weeks ago) I've lost about 10-15 pounds. I barely eat at all. I can't even snack. I get extremely irritated quickly as well. I play hockey and I can't stay on very long because there is no carbs in my body to give me energy. I've also become very anxious 24/7. I DO NOT recommend concerta for anyone.,F,15,3  months54 mg,9/24/2015Email,Concerta
34, 4, ADHD,Appetite loss_ irritability_ headache_ frailness/weakness_ weight loss.,I first began to use Concerta two years ago when I was diagnosed with ADHD. Right away my teachers saw improvement in work_ but at what cost? I lost my appetite_ sometimes completely_ and would not eat lunch. I lost around 8 pounds in the first year from malnutrition until I gained it back over the summer for the fact that I didn't take it during the summer. I was also extremely irritable to everything around me. Every small sound or sound of a pen tapping on a table while I was trying to focus would enrage me and it is extremely hard to control especially around friends. My inability to eat also brought along a slew of new symptoms such as frailness and weakness. My hands would shake as I would write something down or type something on my laptop. Although this medicine did help_ its side effects can be a turn off for some people_ if you have issues with anger_ eating_ or weight I would NOT recommend this drug. I countered the appetite loss by eating large dinners and large breakfasts_ the irritability is countered by sound canceling headphones while doing work. Headaches are countered with constant water consumption. Frailness and weakness is countered by constant working out and sports activities. Also_ sports seems to help with the irritability. Weight loss can be stopped by large meals and sports.,M,17,2  years54 1X D,9/21/2015Email,Concerta

36, 4, ADHD,"If Concerta has intolerable side effects_ do not switch over to an amphetamine containing drug (Adderall_ Vyvanse_ Dexedrine). Amphetamine is a potent neurotoxin that destroys your brains dopamine neurons. Type in ""amphetamine and parkinsons disease risk""_ ""amphetamine neurotoxicity in ADHD"" and ""dopaminergic dysfunction in dextroamphetamine users"" for more information. An amphetamine containing drug will not turn you into a mentally retarded person_ but it will destroy your brains dopamine neurons (in the range of 40-70%) and therefore when you stop taking it_ even after as little as a month_ you will have a permanently reduced capacity to experience pleasure.",Concerta has a lot of side effets due to its ridiculous absorption and release system and due to the fact that it contains the left isomer of methylphenidate (L-Methtlphenidate) which is not only useless but actual blocks the benificial effects of D-Methylphenidate. Focalin XR is far more effective and lacks the side effects of Concerta_ so I recommend you ask your doctor if you can try it. Neither Concerta_ Ritalin or Focalin are neurotoxic (brain damaging) But remember_ stay away from amphetamine containing ADHD meds_ they will mess you up permanently in the long run! Thats why they aren't available in Europe for ADHD.,M,28,2  months50 MG,9/13/2015,Concerta

My marks in school aslo went up as I was more attentive in class and the quality of my work improved dramatically.Every time my dosage increased_ my grades increased_ I became more attentive in class_ I also became more observant. I'm not allowed to drive a car unless I have taken my Concerta (or_ if its later in the day/evening and it's wearing off_ at least 5mg of ritalin).My teachers at school have said that I'm a completely different kid now compared to a couple of months ago - when I was on a lower dose. They've said I'm more confident in class_ the quality and quantity of the work I produce in class has increased tenfold.I won't do any assignments or homework if I have forgotten to take the Concerta because I'm no longer hapoy with the work I produce without it.

38, 2, ADD,Extreme nausea_ dizziness_ emotionally numb_ headache_ trouble breathing_ insomnia_ paranoia_ passed out,I took Concerta during different stages of my life. When I was a child_ a sophomore in hs_ and a junior in college (now). When I was child_ it worked miracles. My parents loved it_ I felt focused. When I was in high school I was okay on it_ minus the occasional head rush. Now I'm kicking off junior year. I wanted to do well so I figured I'd take it again. I now feel that it was a mistake. I hear a constant rushing noise in my ears_ I loose interest in things fairly quickly_ if I loose interest I don't concentrate. I'm emotionally numb_ I had a customer yell at me and I just stared him in the eye the whole time. I couldn't even fake being contrite. When I'm crashing I crash hard. But then I wake up from VERY VIVID NIGHTMARES. I feel like someone is standing over me and laying beside me which freaks me out. I've had small issues with paranoia for awhile. But it has gotten worse while taking this drug. The headaches are almost unbearable. Today takes the cake though. It's hot right now where I live and very humid. I had to walk to to work but I passed out in the middle of the sidewalk. What's weird is when I woke up I just slowly got up and kept going. I was so numb because it was the highest curve of my dosage that having that happened didn't even bother me. I'm thinking about going off of it.,F,20,6  days,9/3/2015,Concerta
39, 3, ADHD,I did not experience any side effects of concerta until after my dosage was moved up to 27mg. My third day taking it i had lost my appetite.

40, 1, I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 7,I was always depressed_ lying around the house_ lethargic_ no appetite what so ever!_ Irritable_ Flat_ Depressed.,I NEVER EVER give this medicine to my children because I know how it effected me and still is. I was very depressed all those years on that drug and no one would listen to me because I was a foster child. It made me feel disconnected with all emotions. Some of the effects are residual and still affect me as an adult. I developed severe OCD_ which I am currently trying to control. I also lost 1/3 of my weight. I started high school weighing 170_ by the end of my Freshman year I was down to 116 because they kept upping my dosage. The only thing I had an appetite for was chips or sometimes other junk food.,F,25,10  times36 2X D,7/20/2015Email,Concerta

Dr switched him to Concerta (27 mg once a day) and I was excited not to have to schedule his dosages anymore. HOWEVER_ since he started taking this_ his appetite is out of control_ I can NOT seem to fill him up and he has gained so much weight in only a month. He started receiving black marks for bad behavior every day (used to be once a week if that)_ very irritable_ hard to reason with. We go back in one week to consult with the doctor.

46, 3, ADHD,extreme hunger but when I eat_ I think I'm starving_ so I eat a decent amount of food_ and my stomach hurts literally every time after I eat because of this.,"I've only been taking concerta for a month now_ and when I started it_ I was fine_ not seeing a big difference. My biggest issue is (obviously) focus. I have a problem that I can't control what I focus on and when. I am a full time online student at a university with a full time and a part time job_ I have no choice but to have so much going on. For example_ When I am at work_ I can only think about school and will try to take opportunities to look at my online classes and get things done at work when I have things that I should be doing and vise versa when I am at home at night trying to focus on getting school work done_ I can't stop focusing on work. In conversations_ I am constantly cutting people off_ but I can't help it because if I don't say what I am thinking I will forget but when I do have the chance to talk_ I am easily distracted and will lose my train of thought and it not only frustrates me but my family and friends_ which is why I sought out a psychiatrist_ after speaking to therapists and trying different non stimulants that worked for depression_ but not so much for ADHD. My psychiatrist upped my dose because its working_ but not really too effectively at this point in my opinion so we are going to try sticking to the same medicine but upping the dose to 36mg. I get this extreme hunger and feel like my stomach is completely empty in the morning before I take the pill at like 8_ around 11 and later on around dinner time.

47, 1, ,My experience with Concerta was TERRIBLE! I highly don't recommend this drug to anyone_ ever. After several months of taking this my mind went into a psychotic state. I heard terrible voices in my head. I thought people could read my mind. many strange things happened to me as a direct result of this medication. I became similar to someone with scitchfremia. I would have awful nightmares each night. I would be so scared to go to sleep because of these terrible awful nightmares. Because of that I lost sleep which only made things worse. I thought people were out to get me and wanted to hurt me. I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone_ not even my worst enemy. Please whoever reads this_ be carful! This is a potent drug.,,F,21,4  months36 mg,5/16/2015,Concerta
48, 3, ADHD,Extreme insomnia_ Extreme social anxiety_ Heart palpitations_ No appetite_ OCD like symptoms_ Zombie State of mind,"After taking Ritalin for several years when it became ineffective (I guess I developed a tolerance to it) I took a break for about a year but my parents decided I needed my Adhd meds again because I was in trouble at school all the time and my grades were horrible. They tried me on Concerta. My grades improved at first but then came the bad stuff. Like Ritalin_ Concerta made me disgusted by the taste and smell of food_ I would only eat once every 3 days_ I was 5' 0"" and weighed 106 lbs. I went from being a social people person to scared to death to even look someone in the eyes_ I thought people could read my mind. I'm not schizophrenic but stimulants bring out side effects that make me think like one. Extreme insonmia_ only slept for 6 hours every 3 days. OCD like symptoms_ started checking everything 3 times_ all labels on products had to be facing a certain way_ I felt like a zombie like I was in my body but something else was controlling my movements and thoughts. Also had heart palpitations. My normally healthy heart would suddenly beat like thump-thump-thu-thu-thump and I would gasp for air when it happened. I took from age 15-18 then again from 19-22. I tried taking a break at age 18 but I lost every job I had and had no option but to start back_ otherwise I could not function as an adult. But eventually_ even though I was a zombie forced to focus_ I could only focus on things I enjoyed. I lost all attentiveness for college and my job_ I forgot to pay rent.",F,29,8  years40mg 1X D,5/6/2015,Concerta

51, 2, ADHD,Where do I begin with side effects... oh I know: nausea_ headache_ irritability_ anxiety_ depressed_ intense crash at the end of the day and hopeless feeling. I could go on_ but I'd rather go ponder my sanity in bed upstairs while I get no sleep tonight.,I guess this works for some people. I am not one of them. I have taken Concerta at a couple different points in my life - most recently I started taking it again (I am 30 now) and have only taken it for 8 days and today will be the last day of this psychotic experiment. Apparently I forgot how terrible it was the first couple of attempts years ago as it was stuffed down my throat by my parents because their boy-genius suddenly couldn't pay attention in classes once he got to high school. I'm BEYOND tired of trying different medications. Stimulants don't mesh well with anxiety_ although my anxiety is unfortunately rooted in my ADHD and inability to complete anything I start. Somehow I'm a successful (by societal standards) young adult that is married and has a great job at a Fortune 500 Company. The only thing that has ever helped me successfully cope with my ADHD and Anxiety is Marijuana. Period. I stopped smoking it the past couple of months_ but that changes tomorrow. I'll take whatever minor side effects come with it (you know: sleeping well_ being able to focus and complete tasks_ the ability to relax)_ because they're not nearly as terrible as every other fucked up prescription drug I've taken along this terrible and seemingly pointless and torturous journey they call life.

52, 1, ADD,When I first started taking CONCERTA_ it helped a bit with my ADD in the sixth grade. Then things started going downhill. At the time _ I was misdiagnosed with ADHD. I started to feel very lethargic and I stopped turning in my homework. I also slipped into bit depression and I stopped talking with people my age. I stopped CONCERTA for a year_ then I came back to it because my parents forced me to do it. My friends I made in seventh grade saw a change and told me to try not taking the pill for a week. I tried that_ and I was less irritable and more energetic. I was forced to take the pill again and lost my appetite_ lost concentration_ lost interest in school.,,F,15,3  years37 MG,3/21/2015,Concerta
53, 2, diagnoses of adult adhd,Worked to the extent it made me focus on my work. After 4 hours of taking the xr version. I was Nauseous and irritable and exhausted. I was crashing out and passing out afterwords and couldnt funtion after the crash_ it stopped Mt sex drive_ I lost my appetite entirely (165 to 150 in one week)_ and I was starting to feel like I had a cold all the time.  They switched me to adderall 30mg twice a day. I thought my doctor was crazy so I only took one a day. I've been taking that for over 2 months now and I've had a 2 week early menstrual cycle that comes with Nasty cold sores (not prone to cold sores) as well as relationship problems. The adderall caused me to start a cycle of ultra rapid cycling bipolar disorder displays. If your already anxious and panic and withdrawl socially_ don't take adderall_ it will make your anxiety into mania hell. I'm going to the clinic today to beg them to step me off of it. I don't want this anymore. Its destroying a perfectly good relationship I have and it causing me to think about how worthless I am.,Crash_ no appetite_ no sex drive_ relationship problems_ menstrual cycle instability with heavier bleeding_ cold sores_ increased sudden onset rapid BD_ paranoia_ complete loss of time_ obsessive need to study.,F,29,4  months27mg,3/13/2015Email,Concerta
54, 2, ADD,loss of appetite_ nausea_ awful insomnia_ depression_ social weirdness_ anxiety,the first week taking concerta I LOVED it_ I was able to focus on schoolwork without being distracted at all and it significantly increased my grades (D+ to B/A average in 4 weeks)_ the only side effects were insomnia (nothing a little weed can't fix) and loss of appetite_ which was very appealing to someone who just gained the freshman 15. However_ within a week my side effects became severe_ my personality completely changed_ I went from being a generally social person to being weird and awkward_ I was CONSTANTLY nauseous_ lost all the weight I gained coming to school_ and I became depressed. My friends noticed a serious change in my behaviour_ and told me to stop taking it. Im currently only taking the medication when I have to study_ however I can't focus at all now. If you really need to focus on school and get your shit together_ this drug is perfect but if you value your social relationships stay away.,F,19,4  weeks27mg 1X D,3/11/2015,Concerta

Pediasure meal replacement. It's like trying to get a toddler to eat or drink..the time & patience.  It's also extremely diffucult to get him to sleep. But with the help of chlonedine & melatonin..12 mg. it's definitely helped him with that.  On the upside it has made night & day difference in his school life & at home.

56, 5, ADHD,Some crying in the beginning but it subsided.,"My 9 year old son has taken this for about a year. We have noticed less mood swings on this compared to the Ritalin he took 2x day. He feels better and acts more in control on this medication. We see a major decrease in impulsivity. We can tell immediately when he wakes up and hasnt taken his meds that the meds work. This was a hard choice_ i was very opposed to medication but after 3 years of trying alternative methods this was needed for his social growth and to ""fit in"" with the other kids.",M,9,1  years36 mg 1X D,3/4/2015Email,Concerta

58, 1, ADHD,Anxiety_ Social withdrawal_ Weight and appetite loss_ Depression_ Chest pain,I was given Ritalin for 4 years and they switched me to Concerta. I remember ritalin making me socially withdrawn_ I had trouble having close friends but I still played at recess and stuff. From age 10 to 13 I went through hell. I was taking the pills 365 days a year. I know for fact I was on 36mg for a short time but then I was upped to 54 and that's when it started. I entered high school and I couldn't make friends_ I couldn't socialize. I was thin and never ate_ I remember chest pain and my heartbeat going crazy giving me chest pain. I had high anxiety levels all the time. I stopped taking it in the last month of the first highschool year_ my parents were forcing me to take it_ and even told me the side effects were in my head. When I stopped I started getting more depressed and slipped into depression_ I had anxiety attacks and chest palpitations_ though no more chest pain. It took 2 full years to get rid of that and to this day I still have anxiety and still deal with episodes of being overall extremely depressed. My appetite came back so vividly that I have stretch marks because of the weight I too suddenly gained as I felt hunger for the first time in 3 years. I was never anxious or depressed before taking concerta and now I'll probably have to deal with it for the rest of my life. It's been almost 8 years and I still deal with this. For the love of god don't do this to your child.,F,20,3  years54mg 1X D,12/6/2014,Concerta
59, 3, ADD,- Constant headaches- Mood swings - Nausea,Suffered with ongoing headaches throughout the day_ but this can be minimised by ensuring to drink the recommended amount of water in a day; Nausea kicked in from time to time_ but could be due to forgetting to eat_ as engrossed in activity (possibly excitement from being able to focus a lot_ after so many years of not doing so); Mood swings are definitely my biggest problem with this drug. I don't feel like myself anymore and I find that I am a lot more quiet_ more irritable_ and more prone to reacting negatively to pressure than I used to be. I find it a lot more difficult to be around my friends as I don't feel like I have much to say anymore. As strange as it sounds_ I feel like my soul has been extracted from my body and replaced with one that's robotic and isn't a real person. I have no idea whether or not these side effects are temporary and whether I get them so severely because I have only just started taking them. I have definitely been a lot more productive and am able to use my time effectively and I'm really glad. But by all means_ I feel very unhappy and I would like to be myself again.,F,23,3  weeks18mg 1X D,11/16/2014Email,Concerta
