0, 3, Birth control,Some serious nausea about 4 days out of the week_ unable to eat enough on these days.,It does the job_ and I've only ever had a patch fall off once. Period is shorter and lighter. But with the nausea making me eat so little of about half the week_ it's been harder for me to lose weight.,F,23,2  months,6/9/2016,Ortho evra
1, 4, Contraception,Nothing so far_ possibly headaches but could be unrelated. As I put it on on the first day of my period_ I noticed that period was shorter than normal which is good.,Does lift up at the edges as fluff gets stuck under it. However for me it's still stayed on and not peeled up much. But When I peeled off the first patch it came off so easily_ like seemed hardly sticky on the inside that I'm now worried it hasn't been working. Can someone help with this?,F,19,7  days,5/23/2016Email,Ortho evra

4, 5, Pregnancy prevention,Breast tenderness occasionally. Breast growth. No migraines. No mood swings. Shorter_ lighter almost pain free periods.,I highly recommend Evra. It's initially tricky to find the place on your body which best suits. It was a saving grace for me with period pain. I had to get a prescription of strong painkillers for my doctor each month as I wasn't able to move with pains. I usually take mild painkillers now only on day 2. Periods last 4 days_ pain-free day 1_3_4. No weight gain but get odd cravings from time to time (particularly pickled foods).Breast tenderness is hard on it. Only fault_ it's very infrequent but when it comes my boobs are unbelievably painful. Hasn't once fallen off either.,F,19,8  months,4/21/2016,Ortho evra

6, 4, Bc,This birth control definitely works...you will not get pregnant. It also helped with acne. It did cause me to have migraines at times or feel nauseated in the mornings at times. But as long as I ate a good breakfast and exercised the nausea and migraines would dissipate.,I thought ortho evra was the best choice for me and it really never bothered me. I went off finally as my husband and I want to have a baby and now am just a little concerned even though my doctor told me not to be.

15, 4, Medical reasons,Low sex drive_ mood swings_ migraines during the off week_ less cramps_ lighter and shorter periods,I took it to help alleviate the extremely heavy periods I had before. It certainly did its job_ I have a 4-5 day period now instead of 10_ and cramps are almost non existent and mild painkillers help them go away. However_ I am experiencing a really bad diminish in my sex drive and severe mood swings. If you have a history of any kind of depressive or anxiety disorder_ I wouldn't recommend this patch. Other than that_ it's worked great for me,F,18,7  months,10/11/2015,Ortho evra
16, 1, ,Severe cramps_ continuous heavy flow period_ feelings of Depression_ crying for no reason_ weight gain_ faintness,During my weeks on the patch_ I continuously had a period for about two of those weeks along with very painful cramps_ I took my patch off and it basically emotionally broke me! Crying all the time for little or no reason_ feeling anxious or worried for no reason_ feeling dizzy and faint all the time. I would definitely NOT recommend the patch. Particularly if you suffer from a history of depression I have found out the emotional side affects can be hugely heightened which I was not made aware of when getting the patch!,F,18,1  months,9/2/2015Email,Ortho evra
17, 3, Regulation_ prevention of pregnancy,Weight gain_ acne_ breast tenderness_ mood swings_ migraines_ heavy flow_ cramping_ burnt/discoloured skin,I've been using the patch now for nearly 9 months and it's done a great job preventing pregnancy. However_ sometimes it falls off and it's hard to stick it back on. I experienced severe weight gain when I switched to the patch (20lbs.) and my breasts always seemed to be tender. I get migraines at least 3 times a week_ however that may be caused by an eye condition I have so I'm not sure whether the birth control is to blame. During my periods_ I experienced light flow for 2 days and then extremely heavy flow for 2 days and spotting for the remainder. The flow is heavier than I've ever experienced to the point where I'm changing my tampon almost hourly. On top of that_ my cramps are through the roof. Midol doesn't help and neither does extra strength ibuprofen_ Advil_ aspirin Â– nothing makes it go away. The patch is itchy and every week when I removed my patch_ my skin under and around the patch is red_ bumpy_ and burnt. Also just today when I removed my patch I noticed that around where the edges of the patch were my skin is yellow. Although this prevents pregnancy very well_ I would not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin. It has worked for me_ but the side effects are insane and I'm seriously considering changing products or stopping birth control altogether.,F,20,9  months,8/15/2015,Ortho evra
18, 1, Stop periods or at least help with,Nausea and trouble breathing within 30 minutes.,I had my first patch on for 30 minutes. Was already nauseous and felt like it was extremely hard to breathe.

19, 3, Sexually active in a relationship,Redness_ itchiness_ burning after taking the patch off.,I started on the patch because I was sexually active with my partner and wanted to make sure I was on birth control and also to regulate my period. I loved the patch. It was the best birth control method I've been on. Recently_ when I would wear the patch_ it would be so itchy. I would take the patch off on the Sunday to switch them and I would have a red_ burn/welts where the patch was. It's extremely painful and not worth it. I am not switching birth controls because this has been happening and its only getting worse. I would recommend this product because its so convenient but once you start_ if you start_ getting side effects or something like this... SWITCH methods.,F,19,5  months 3X M,8/10/2015,Ortho evra
20, 4, Birth control and control cramps,Weight gain_ migraines_ irritability_ depression_ moodiness,While on it I never got cramps_ where without it I would have such bad cramps I couldn't get out of bed.  I didn't get pregnant.  It's easy to remember to change for those like me who can't remember to take a pill everyday.  The migraines and weight gain just became too much.

My periods were what they were suppose to be. 2 weeks ago I had my period after that I put on a new patch which was a different brand and smaller.

I'll get really hungry but never satisfied_ everything tastes horrible now and once I eat stomach pains come.. I've become extremely emotional just breaking out crying because of all this nausea. I'm hoping my body will get used to the hormones and the bad side effects will stop or at least slow down. the only good thing is I know when my period come_ it's light_ no cramps_ when I'm around my boyfriend my sex drive is good_ and of course pregnancy prevention. just glad I'm not alone:( was starting to lose my mind.,,F,17,2  months,5/15/2014Email,Ortho evra

49, 3, Birth conrtol_ hormone balance,At first the patch worked wonders_ it helped my hormones balance out even with the high estrogen. I only gained about 5 pounds which is expected with birth control anyway. My sex drive increased_ and it helped my migraines become infrequent. However_ after about 10 months of taking it_ I started getting moody_ and started getting migraines again. Then at about a year and half of taking it I had to stop it because I started getting rashes where the patch was. I think this isnt a drug to be used for a long period of time which sucks cuz it worked well in the beginning.,It is dangerous to take because of high estrogen so be careful_ and doesnt work great long term.

50, 4, Birth Control,GOOD: Boobs grew slightly_ increased sex drive_ lighter periods.BAD: Nausea and hot flashes during ovulation_ menstrual cramping_ PMS.,I was on the pill for 7 years and I noticed it was starting to get to me; my emotions were all out of whack_ I became bloated_ I had low sex drive_ and I often forgot to take my pill everyday. I have been on the Ortho Evra patch for 3 months now. I would recommend the patch to someone like me who might not remember to take pills regularly; although the pill is the safer option because it has a lower dose of estrogen. It took a few days to get used to having the patch on_ and it can feel a little itchy at first. Sometimes the patch forms a sticky residue around the edge much like a bandage would_ but it easily wipes off in the shower. I noticed that around the days of ovulation I tend to get random hot flashes with waves of nausea a few times in the morning. This only happens for 1-2 days_ and it is usually on the same days every month_ so I know when to expect it. I get a little bit more cramping during my period on the patch than I did with the pill but I never used to take any OTC pain killers; now I just take some Motrin. I also have PMS really bad on the 2 days before my period_ nothing like when I was on the pill_ but I return to my normal emotional state after I start my period. My periods are lighter since being on the patch and I have not gained any weight_ my boobs have grew slightly more cleavage_ and my sex drive has gone back up! Overall_ I am pleased with my decision to switch from the pill to Ortho Evra.,F,21,3  weeks 1X W,3/17/2014EmailHistory,Ortho evra

Side affects are as follows: nausea that comes in average twice a week for me_ I'm experiencing it now as a matter of fact_ I usually just drink water to make it go away; extreme and I'm talking extremely painful breast tenderness_ all day everyday_ wearing a sports bra helps the most_ my breasts feel so heavy_ they are a bit bigger too; sometimes I get an extremely sharp stabbing pain by my ovaries or a burning pain down the middle of my lower abdomen that feels like my uterus is tearing in half_ only way I can describe it_ it happens maybe once a day; patch fell off once because I put in jeans right after putting it on; headaches sometimes but I got those before the patch so could be just me_ oh and mood swings for sure_ lots of rage; I was very successful in a diet and exercise plan before the patch and once I started it_ it was hard to control eating healthy and exercising daily_ it increased my appetite and made me more tired I guess. That's it. Lots of side affects. I probably will continue using it tho. Pill is too frequent and Nuva ring grosses me out.,,F,20,3  weeks1 patch,9/22/2013,Ortho evra
63, 3, Birth Control Method,I am normally a happy_ determined_ and confident person. A couple weeks after beginning the patch_ I started to lose interest in everything. I wasn't sure whether it was me or the patch but I experienced horrible mood swings. I would go to bed crying and wake up crying over absolutely nothing. At first I thought I might've been going through a rough time with my boyfriend but there would be days where I'd love him wholeheartedly and days where I'd contemplate breaking up. I seriously thought I developed a bipolar disorder or severe depression. I wanted to be in my own bed all the time. Lost interest in food that I usually loved. Developed insecurities. Also developed a keen sense of smell where everything would trigger the urge to vomit. Basically_ things that never bothered me before are now triggering anger and sadness. Sore/tender breasts_ weight gain_ itch at patch site_ and lost of sex drive. I also had to use lubricant for sex_ which I never needed. Even my boyfriend noticed that,The patch did the job of preventing pregnancy because my boyfriend didn't feel the need to practice the pull out method anymore. No babies.

Other oral BC's like Alesse_ Yaz_ TriCyclen made me insanely depressed and completely irrational_ and I'm bad with remembering to take pills.

Have ripped off maybe 4 or 5 accidentally with my jeans_ I now wear it in a different place. Only got itchy for the first 2 or 3 patches_ no crazy rash or scabbing. I notice mood swings for the first 2 days when I have put on a new patch. Period always comes around 48 hours after I've taken the patch off and lasts 4-5 days. Doesn't help me so much with acne_ but acne is not really a problem for me. Sometimes still get cramps every third period or so. Periods are moderate_ not too heavy.

I noticed if I scratched the area_ I'd get an awful rash for a few weeks so I'd just try really hard to never itch it and it was fine. It made my boobs a bit bigger which was awesome. I didn't gain any weight really because I was trying really hard NOT to gain weight. After about 4-5 months_ I started to get more tired than normal. I'd feel so exhausted even though I didn't do anything all day.Smoking DID make things worse.

Nothing too serious that bothered me.More recently after 4 years of taking it: Mild to severe headaches everyday_ nausea/feel sick with no vomiting_ dizziness_ loss of appetite_ anxiety and occasional panic attacks_ feeling depressed at times_ avoiding to go places and see people.,I have been on the patch since I was 14_ going on 15_ because my mam was paranoid I had boyfriends I didn't tell her about and I was sexually active. I've now just turned 18 and have been sexually active for nearly 2 years_ so I believe there was no need for me to go on the patch at such a young age and I think the doctor shouldn't have let my mam made me go on it. The patch was working fine for me_ except for the weight gain_ which didn't kill me I suppose_ but would rather it didn't happen and my boobs got a good deal bigger which wasn't so much of a bad thing either. But in the past 5 months or so_ I've had panic attacks_ feeling depressed_ anxiety_ avoided going to sleepovers or clubbing with my friends and also I got diagnosed with Acid Reflux and took meds for that and started getting headaches_ the doctor said it was the patch and the meds were reacting with each other and told me to stop taking the meds but the headaches weren't fully gone so I decided to stop taking putting on the patch also to see if that made any difference after a month.

Went on it because I didn't remember to take my pill every day_ so I wanted something easier. The patch tends to get dirty easily from lint_ clothing_ etc. and has a tendency to peel off around the corners - I am a neat/clean freak so I can imagine this is happening to a lot of other women. I have gained 25 pounds and haven't changed anything drastically in my routine. I just had a 24 hour bout of the symptoms I described. I ""googled"" my symptoms and was lead directly to Evra reviews. I didn't know all of these side effects_ and after reading through everyone's reviews_ I am happy to know that my anxiety and depression that came out of no where and have intensified are NOT me. I went from a bubbly_ inspired_ self motivator to laying on the couch not wanting to move_ crying for everything_ and mood swings that put the gem in gemini. I also just learned that Evra has 60% more estrogen than other pills and that they give this dosage to women going through menopause. I have stopped taking it so I hope to be free of these symptoms ASAP. I hear it can take up to 6 months to get the extra hormones out of your body.

HOWEVER for the past year or so I have noticed side affects which I didn't initially relate to evra_it was only when I came on forums like this that I wondered.

I planned to come off it end of 2012 but after realising these leg cramps etc maybe related to the patch_and all this talk of blood clots etc_ I have stopped it now.

Over the last 3 years the side affects I have experienced have drastically increased over time.  Patch one I experience very painful bloating in my lower abdomen. My lower abdomen is so swollen and painful that I am in tears any time I try to use the bathroom. I get constipated because it hurts too much to poop. The 2nd week the swelling in my abdomen is almost gone but I am starting to have almost violent mood swings. I am angry or depressed all the time_ and I am starting to have bad cramps. My cervix is swollen and rock hard and if I try to move it or touch it I feel like I was kicked in the cervix. The 3rd week I have horrible cramps and my Boobs are so swollen I can hardly move my arms or even drive. The cramping almost double by the day during this week. By the end of week 3 I am spending most of my time laying in bed crying from the pain. Week 4 is when the real pain starts. Week 4 is the week of my mensies. 90percent of this week I spend crying and wishing for death. The other 10 percent is wondering how much more ibuprofen and tylenol I can take before my liver fails.

Nobody told me this_ and I failed to research this beforehand.  Topamax above a certain dosage renders birth control (for at least some of us) useless_ including Ortho Evra.  I had periods on the patch every two weeks for the five months I tried it.  Very disappointing.  Am seeking another migraine prophylaxis method_ then perhaps try the patch again and hopefully have a happier update on the patch_ it was very good otherwise - no skin reaction_ stuck well_ and no other problems.",,F,49,5  monthsOne patch 1X W,5/3/2011Email,Ortho evra

174, 3, as a birth control,GAINED WEIGHT- IRREGULAR PERIODS,I have been off of Ortho Evra for over 9 months now and my husband and I are wanting to conceive a baby. Unfortunately_ we are still having troubles getting pregnant. I don't know if the birth control is still in my system_ or what is going on. We have been timing everything and I know my husband is fertile... he has a son already from a previous relationship. I am beginning to wonder if either it is still in my system or if I am now incapable of conceiving. =( Plus... I went from 125lbs when I started the birth control to 160 when I stopped it. I can't say that it is completely at the fault of the birth control_ but my habits did not change_ so something was out of whack.,F,24,21  days 1X W,3/28/2011,Ortho evra

I took my patch off a couple days ago and the bleeding is already letting up so things should be going back to normal soon. So_ aside from this... I was diagnosed with endometriosis when I was 14 so I've been battling different bc methods for years now trying to find one that doesn't make me vomit every day have a break down at the drop of a hat and so far this has really been the best choice for me. If things go back to normal for me with this bleeding I would suggest this method to anyone to at least try. Ps. My sex drive has not changed a bit!,F,22,4  months 1X O,3/24/2011Email,Ortho evra

That was the last straw for me.I tore it off that nite and have felt much better since.,I was on the depo provera for 7 years before this and the only problem I had was weight gain and I was a bit emotional.

178, 4, To control cramps,Major mood swings after a few 12 week cycles (one period every 3 months)_ some weight gain,Was on it for about 2 years in my mid-20s and after I started taking it for 3 mos. at a time it made me crazy emotional. Started again after another bad trial of the pill for my horrible cramps. The patch works for me because the hormone flow is continual. On the pill_ I went into horrible crying fits about an hour after taking it every morning. Plus I am a student/single mom and love how little fuss it is versus the pill. I have always had near perfect skin and suddenly pores are HUGE. This didn't happen before. Only been one month this time so I hope it's an adjustment thing. It's more expensive than other forms of b.c. but worth it for me. I agree it's better for ladies in 20s or later.,F,30,1  months 1X W,2/23/2011,Ortho evra

I would say try this method_ but be very very careful. make sure that you listen to your body and pay attention to anything that is not normal for you. I think this method would be better for women in their mid twenties and older.,F,27,2  weeks 1X W,2/16/2011,Ortho evra

After reading this board_ I see that I'm not alone.  The anxiety crept in so slowly over the years_ as did the increasingly low sex drive_ that it took a moment of clarity to realize how bad it had gotten.  Headaches I can handle; this other stuff_  no.  I love the convenience_ but I'd rather be back to my cheery self_ enjoying my husband!,F,35,5  years 1X W,2/8/2011,Ortho evra

Began having anxiety attacks.,I had to have a stronger method of birth control due to Pelvic Congestion.  Oral birth control pills with higher dosages made me throw up so my Dr. moved me to Ortho Evra.  Didn't realize the Ortho Evra was causing all of these problems until I got off of it.  Been off for about three weeks now.  Had Mirena inserted about 2 weeks ago.  Been in a much better mood_ sex drive is back and then some.  No anxiety attacks.  Feel like eating again which is great since I'm about 20 lbs. under weight. Ortho Evra almost ruined my marriage b/c of the mood swings_ lack of sex drive and lack of interest in day to day activities.

I am so thankful I found this site with posts from real women.  The side effects are real!  Yes_ everyone's body is different but OMG!!! I know that I am not crazy now.  This patch almost RUINED my honeymoon.  I began taking a few days before my wedding and the patch zapped my sex-drive_ depleted my energy_ I had nausea 24/7_ pain & aches in chest and abdominal cramps_ trouble sleeping_ and I was very emotinal with crying fits and depression. Only plus was the lighter periods.  I was having ongoing nightmares about being on a psyc ward.  My husband was very concerned because I had NO DESIRE FOR SEX!

Every body reacts to it differently_ so you don't know if it will happen to you unless you try it. I've used it for 5 years and have never had a side effect except for a slight itching where the patch was_ big deal. I love using the patch_ I only have to think about it once a week and my period is always at the exact same time every month and is very light.

I have been on the patch for 2 weeks and I absolutely do not like it! First_ the patch keeps peeling up so I've had to replace the patches a few times. The nurse practitioner said the patch was exactly the same as the pill_ but it's not! I found out today that it has 60% more estrogen than the pill form. Anyway_ I've had constant nausea and headaches. Today I woke up feeling very moody and agressive and I have been crying all day. I am suffering from fatigue also. After reading reviews on this webpage I realized it's not just me! This patch is horrible and I will not continue to use it.,F,23,2  weeks 1X W,12/13/2010,Ortho evra
189, 2, Contraceptive,Moodiness_Inability to sleep_ Decreased appetite.,This was my first encounter with ortho evra. I rate it as the most unpleasant experience I've ever had with birth control besides Yasmin. After about the first 5 days I began to experience extreme nausea_ a decreased appetite which was way abnormal for me_ and not to mention major depressive symptoms such as moodiness_ crying. I also experienced plenty of headaches. Overall I just felt very fatigued nonetheless I could never sleep. I probably received an hour or two of sleep each night without tossing and turning the rest of the night. My boyfriend thinks I have become a demon and has been trying to escape my wrath. I ripped the patch off about an hour ago and am already beginning to feel better. I've had trouble with birth control in the past and starting to think my body just can't take the extra hormones. It was very easy and convenient using the patch however. I'll advise anyone to be careful with this patch.,F,23,2  weeks 1X W,12/7/2010,Ortho evra

192, 3, birth control,Weight gain; mild headaches (1-2 days after taking off 3rd patch); after 3 years of taking_ break-through bleeding lasting for weeks at a time. Pro: Easy to remember to use.,I used the patch for about 3 years before I started having negative side effects. I gained about 10-15 pounds right off but part of that was due to my poor food choices (living at college). But I changed my eating habits and began regular exercise and still could not loose the weight. Then I started getting irregular light bleeding; it would start about the 3rd week and last for a day or two then stop and then I'd have my period as scheduled. This would occur for a month or two in a row then 2-3 months later would occur again. After 2 years of this_ I finally realized stress wasn't solely to blame. This bleeding eventually lasted for an entire month_ which is what caused me to switch. If it wasn't for the irregular bleeding and weight gain_ I would have stayed with this form of bc because it was easy to remember.,F,25,5  years 1X W,11/1/2010,Ortho evra

I put the first one on on Friday and immediately felt horrible_ tingling arm_ pain where the patch was applied_ i woke up the next morning and was so dizzy i actually fell while walking_ then started the chest pain.  The dizziness and chest pain continued until monday.

I hadn't ever been on it before and am very petite.  At this point_ I've been on it for one complete cycle (4 weeks).  I can say it has actually gone better than I thought it would.  The very first patch made me slightly dizzy within 6 hours_ and the breast tenderness set in about 3 days into the first patch.  I woke up feeling very grouchy and aggressive which was definitely new for me.  However_ I've felt zero nausea_ which is a huge positive.  Also positive - I was a small A cup_ and four weeks later_ presto_ a small B cup!  My skin also appears to be clearing up after an initial flair up of my acne.  I did not get pregnant_ and my period started 3 days after I took the 3rd patch off.  However_ this medicine is very expensive when compared to generic pills.  I paid $70 for 1 month worth.  Even with the cost in mind_ I feel like not getting pregnant_ clearer skin_ and an increase in breast size are worth the less pleasant side effects.  I'd suggest at least trying the patch because every woman responds differently to it.,F,30,1  months 1X W,10/23/2010,Ortho evra

197, 2, Birth Control,Nausea_ migraine headaches_ lack of energy_ loss of sleep_ weight gain_ LOSS OF SEX DRIVE.,"I've been on the patch for a year. The thing about the patch is that sometimes the side effects can creep up on you slowly over a long period of time; so_ after a year of being on the patch_ you have a laundry list of symptoms. That's exactly what happened to me. After being on the patch for a year_ I realized I had about 17lbs weight gain_ migraine headaches (NEVER had experienced them before)_ extreme nausea_ could never get a good night of sleep_ LAZY/ TIRED/ FATIGUE_ and complete loss of sex drive. It took a while for me to realize all of these things were from the patch. I noticed some of my symptoms went away when I was on the ""week off"" and having my period. For example_ every month when I was having my period I would actually loose 5 lbs because I didn't have the patch on. But then I would gain it right back as soon as I had to put the patch back on.",F,22,1  years 1X W,10/11/2010,Ortho evra

I started on natural progesterone and it seems to help the libido issue - not sure yet about teh weight gain. Best part about the patch was that I was very moody and my brain was very foggy BEFORE I started using it. NOW_ I feel like I have my brain and my life back.

I liked how light and short my period was. Just as I had started my first patch of my fourth month I began getting chest pains_ when I got to the point where I couldn't breath I went to the ER and it turns out at 20 I have a PE_ a blood clot on my lung_ most likely due to the extreme surge of hormones from the patch. It it the only risk factor my doctors could find that would cause a blood clot on my lung at such a young age.,I highly recommend checking into side effects_ they are real_ they are there for a reason.,F,20,3  months 1X W,9/19/2010,Ortho evra

Went 10 years of having a period 7-10x per year_ to a faithful every 28 days. before the patch i had NO PMS CRAMPS_ now I do. and it has lengthened my periods to nearly a week. Before it would be 2-5 days. So in essence I experience the 'typical' signs on menstruating_ but this was not normal for me BEFORE i started the Birth Control Patch. Feel my hormones are out of whack. I tried to take myself off of the patch only to experience 3 periods over a course of 5 weeks. I think I will find a new BC method.

I'd never really noticed any side effects until this last round_ which has been about 9 months now.  I've noticed when I'm on the patch_ I cry much easier.  I'm not a crier at all_ typically_ but on the patch I cry maybe every other week.  The main issue though_ is the decreased sex drive.  I hadn't been in a relationship when I was on the patch previously_ so I guess I didn't notice it then.  It's really put a strain on my relationship with my partner_ especially when I consider the five months we were together before the patch compared to the last nine on it.

Then I was fine. Few weeks went on an no problem. I just finished my period and put a new patch on. The day after_ the nightmare started.

217, 3, birth control,back ache_ mood swings,I just gave birth to a beautiful baby girl April of 2010.  This is my first use of any hormonal contraceptive.  It is difficult to distinguish what side effects are correlated to the postpartum period of my pregnancy or the Ortho Evra patch itself.  Since my pregnancy and the birth of my child_ I have had many of different behavioral_ emotional_ and physical differences from before my pregnancy that are already listed as a warned by Ortho Evra such as mood swings_ acne_ night sweats_ weight gain_ fatigue_ gas_ breast tenderness.  Before my pregnancy I have always been happy-go-lucky_ bubbly_ cool under pressure_ relaxed_ and didn't get angry too easily as compared to my current state of mind today.  It may be too early to give a proper rating of satisfaction with only 5 days of use_ but the only addition to the symptoms I have noticed has been slight back pain_ since I was ordered by my Doctor to only apply the patch on the lower part of my body if I were planning to continue breast feeding.  I am curious to find out if my side effects of my postpartum period will only become worse or improve.  I am keeping a positive outlook each day at a time for a healthy overall experience.,F,25,5  days 1X W,6/6/2010Email,Ortho evra

Near loss of sex drive_ Migraines_ Dizziness and Laziness_ Enlarged Breasts_ Excessive Vaginal Di.scharge,"I started taking OE a month before I got married because I was aweful about taking the pill every day.  I thought the patch would just be easier to remember.  The first side effect was the enlarged breasts.  Friends who hadn't seen me in a while were commenting on it at the wedding.  The other imediate side effect was mood swings - they were minor at first but I had a strange experience-crying exactly one week before my period started to the day.  That's strange because prior to being on the patch_ I never really cried at all_ maybe 3 or 4 times in the entire 3 years I had been with my husband at that point-total!  Beyond that the side effects were pretty mild UNTIL around the 4 month mark.  I started getting EXTREME anxiety as well as excessive vaginal discharge which led to an extreme drop in my libido.  I was reclusive_ lonely_ always dizzy and had migraines and I got very lazy.  I didn't account any of these side effects to the patch until around the 8 month mark when I found this site and everything clicked-it all made sense!  I was totally relieved to read of other's accounts on being on the patch.  I've been off the patch for around 3 months now and since my acne had gotten bad and my anxiety fluctuates from non-existant to just horrible scary thoughts.  The vaginal discharge still hangs around_ but I found out recently that ortho evra works by making your ""fluid"" toxic to his sperm cells.  Yuck!

Did not want to socialize_ sad all the time.  I was always tired! I would go to the gym after work 4 times a wk_ I stopped going because I was just too tired! I have never felt this way.

Increased severity of head and back pain for first day. You don't have to be incredibly 'timely' about changing. Would forget and change a day or two late and never had problems.

The only other annoying side effect in the first month was the breast soreness. It felt tender and hurt like hell the entire month. Apart from these side effects_ I experienced newer ones in the second month- awful nausea and dizziness. Dizziness was quite erratic but it was severe and so was the nausea. I was normal from time-to-time. I have one more batch of these patches to finish. After which I would probably try a different pill. I am done with patches.,F,28,2  months 1X W,3/17/2010,Ortho evra

Experienced breast tenderness_ but always thought it was related to caffiene.  I now remember extreme anxiety in the first couple of years_ but chalked that up at the time to stressful events taking place in my life.  I have put on weight and become more inactive_ but thought that just came with age.  Husband would say I am very moody_ but I always thougt it was just him.  Guess it could be me.  Did notice an extreme drop in sex drive.  Holding that over hubby's head to encourage a vasectomy. LOL!  Have had increasing fear of breast cancer due to so much estrogen in the patch and b/c of the length of time I've used it.  Going to gyno tomorrow_ will discuss with her.

I've been back on it now for 2 months and I've started a week early both months. But_ I am fairly sure that the mood swings are back as well.

Overall I am happy with it. I love the concept of it. My biggest problem is that ever since I started the patch I get vertigo every now and then. It happens after I put a new patch on and it doesn't happen everytime. This is confusing. The first episode of vertigo I had was just a couple weeks after I first started it. The vertigo stuck around for 2 days. Since then the most it lasts is about a day sometimes only a few minutes. The vertigo is not always extreme either sometimes it is very mild. Today it is medium.

253, 1, birth control,extreme anxiety and panic attacks; depression; longer periods; mood swings.,I was on the patch for about five mons before I started noticing any side effects.  Everything seemed fine up until one day I started getting extreme panic attacks and anxiety which seemed to come out of nowhere and would last mins to hours.  I've been dealing with this for three mons and in that time I've felt like I've turned into a different person.  I'm a generally happy and optimistic person but I feel like I've transformed into someone else.  The extreme anxiety is something I deal with on a daily and sometimes hourly basis_ it never goes away.  I would STRONGLY advise all women to avoid this drug it has ruined three mons of my life_ thank god not more!  This web site was so comforting to me because up until I read all these reviews I thought I was going crazy and did not link my problems to the drug.

Otherwise_ i was pleased; My breasts even got bigger_ so i LOVED that. :) The second month was  different story. I became depressed an didn't fully realize it at first. I am a very optimistic person_ natually but the patch changed my outlook on everything. To be honest_ at times i felt like i was posessed. I know thissounds crazy but this is just one testimony of what the patch did to ME. Everyone is different. I've had the patch off for a few wees now and i feel dramatically better.

266, 2, birth control_ regulating my period,severe nausea/vomiting on second day_ feeling of general malaise/nausea_ increased anxiety_ breast tenderness_ severe menstrual cramps,I'd first like to say to people who have been diagnosed with GAD or any kind of panic disorder - ortho evra may not be right for you. As someone who has suffered anxiety my whole life and has been on and off medications_ I'm very aware of how external circumstances affect my anxiety. Two days after I put on the patch_ I noticed a definite increase in my anxiety and I had to increase my medication and still had trouble sleeping and stomach troubles.As for the nausea - per my doctor's instructions_ I put on the patch the first day of my period. That first day_ I was totally fine.  The next day_ at about 10am_ my menstrual cramps suddenly became unbearable and the nausea started.  By noon_ I was vomiting.  I vomited every 20 minutes for the next 4 hours_ then fell into an exhausted sleep.  After that_ the cramps and vomiting diminished.  The nausea_ however_ stayed with me every day I was on the patch.With the nausea and the increased anxiety_ I made an executive decision about two weeks after I first put on the patch to pull it off. I'm really wary of any medication that affects the hard work I've put into controlling my panic disorder and it just didn't seem worth it.,F,27,14  days,10/6/2009,Ortho evra

But this patch is a pain in the butt(Literally). Im 17 and this is my first time taking a birth control. I figured the patch would be easy considering my friend took it and had no problems. I read the review on other sites and they were nothing but negative. I have been in bed for the past week cuz everytime i get up to do something I feel sick to my stomach and have to run to the toilet. I have lost 6 pounds in the last 3 days simply because nothing sounds good and when it does.. I cant seem to keep it down. I also have pains in my legs every time i switch but cheeks and get constant pains in my chest. Today I started crying for really no reason. It take ALOT to make me cry_ without the patch I cried an average of 2 times a year. Now I have cried 3 times.. today. My anxiety is through the roof which ISNT good_ I even take anti-depressants and anti-anxiety pils on a daily basis. I dont do well with anxiety at all.  I talked to my doctor and even tho it is less convinient I have convinced myself to switch to the pill because I am sick of laying in this bed.

Until my prescription ran out and I didn't have time to go back to the gyno to get it filled so I was off OrthoEvra for about 2 months and I lost weight (I go to the gym 5 days a week for 3 yrs now) and in these 2 months I lost a good 5-7lbs.  My anxiety was gone and I wasn't nausious.  I didn't notice that these side effects were gone until I actually went back on the patch and the nausea came back as well as the weight_ anxiety and dizziness.

282, 1, birth control,Positive: Convenient and easy to remember to change; felt safe and comfortable that I was protected against pregnancy.Negative: Depression; mood swings; anxiety; long periods.,I would not recommend this drug to anyone with a history of depression. I went on Evra a few months after getting over a severe bout of depression_ from which I had recovered completely and extremely well_ and the symptoms of depression and anxiety returned immediately when I started this birth control method. When I was depressed before I had reasons for it; this time the depression came upon me unprovoked (in fact_ at a very happy time in my life) or at the tiniest things. The symptoms of depression were worst during the second and third weeks of the cycle_ but also present during the first. The best time of the cycle was during the 4th week; but_ my periods were 8 days long_ while on my own natural cycle they were only 4-5 days long.A couple of days ago I switched to a pill form (Yasmin) to see if it is better at not causing depression. I just tore of the patch and started the pill because I couldn't take the depression anymore_ so I may have increased risk of pregnancy for the first cycle of the pill? The reason I went on the patch in the first place is I thought it would be easier than remembering to take a pill every day_ which it was. It also gave me peace of mind that I was protected against pregnancy. I'm not certain the depression was from the Evra_ but I think it is. And there is a risk of depression with Yasmin as well so I'm wondering if hormonal bc tends to be bad for that overall. I guess every person has to experiment to see what is best for her.,F,24,3.5  months,7/20/2009,Ortho evra

First the positive. Prior to taking the patch_ I suffered from severe back acne and severe hair loss. Since taking the patch_ my acne has dissappeared and my hair doesn't fall out anymore (besides the occasional strand every now and then). I also had difficulty sleeping at night_ but now I sleep like a baby. I have no more trouble falling asleep and find myself sleeping through the night. Also_ my moods are pretty stable_ in fact I am not near as emotional as I was prior to taking the patch. Now_ the negative. Since taking the patch_ I have gained approximately 20 pounds (20 pounds in seven months is quite a bit considering I am not pregnant). This might have something to do with the fact that I ""feel"" hungry all the time. What use to fill me up no longer cuts it_ plus I feel faint and dizzy as if my blood sugar is low and therefore feel the need to eat so as to keep my self from passing out. The only way I can describe it is I feel like I need to eat something heavy and rich in calories (not sweet_ but heavy like steak or cream). I seem to retain water as well_ but have discovered certain food and drink can exasperate this problem. Last_ but not least_ are the migraines. Prior to the patch_ I would have one/two migraine attacks/year. Now_ I have one/two every month (this is the most annoying). Only major complaints are the migraines and wei",F,28,7  months,7/14/2009,Ortho evra

I took off the patch and was on my period for a month and half after the entire time my feet swelled up to a horrible size and my feet and knees were in great pain. I got off of my period for 4 days while 3 of them my feet went back to normal. Then I was on my period again and they swelled back up again. For the first month and a half that my feet swelled doctors told me that it wasn't the patch that was causing this and my parents spent thousands of dollars trying to find out what was wrong with me and now we find out that it was the patch screwing up my hormones.

297, 2, Control  heavy bleeding,scalp hair loss_ severe fatigue_ some weight gain_ mood swings,i started using patch four yrs ago because I had heavy periods.  the patch helped control the heavy bleeding but i begaan shedding excessive amouns of hair approximately two years ago.  just checked the net and found that orth evra has excessive amounts of estrogen which could cause hair loss.  i'm switching back to the pill.  a low dose androgen birth control pill. I went to two different doctors and one was a dermatologist. Neither would contribute the patch to the hair loss but they would to the fatigue and mood swings.  ,F,32,4  years,4/19/2009,Ortho evra
298, 2, Birth Control,Nausea_ mood swings_ skin irritation_ increased appetite,"Day one_ I had no side effects until I went to bed. My skin under and around the patch was radiating incredible heat compared to the rest of my skin; it started burning uncontrollably and it itched badly. Day two_ I felt nauseous all day long; it wasn't as bad as when I was pregnant. By day three_ I was eating mass amounts of food and couldn't get ""full."" I had severe mood swings and attacked my husband verbally when he did nothing wrong. I couldn't take the burning any longer and my mood swings drove me to rip the patch off. A few days later_ I still have a blotchy rash but my mood swings stopped.",F,22,3  days,4/11/2009,Ortho evra
299, 1, Birth Control,weight gain (15 lbs.)_ DRASTICALLY decreased sex drive_ chest tenderness_ breast enlargement_ fatigue_ slight depression_ aching in left arm & leg_ and mood swings galore!,"I started Ortho Evra about two years ago for the first time and after about 5 months I just couldn't stand it anymore. Yes_ it was VERY convenient_ easy to use_ and worked well but the side effects were terrible. I very noticeably gained 15 lbs and seeing as I'm only 4'10"" I've hardly got any extra room for weight gain. I had zero sex drive which was also very noticeable to my boyfriend_ and so weren't the mood swings_ fatigue_ and just pure laziness. My boobs did grow a whole cup size which was about the only perk. I stopped wanting to go out after work or hang out with my friends so I decided to stop it. I went back on it after half a year or so because it was the only BC that I seemed to work for me (I can never remember to take pills_ and forget about shots and sticking things in my vagina.. no thank you) I began to experience the same effects. I did my research and found out about all the lawsuits and recalls for Ortho Evra because it increased the risk of blood clots and heart attacks by 3 times. I read a case about a 19 year old girl that developed a 10-inch blood clot in her brain and I decided that was it. Never will I go on OE again after that. I'm currently excited to see the weight disappear like it had the first time and have my sex drive back as well as being myself.",F,19,2  years,4/9/2009,Ortho evra
300, 2, Birth Control,Weight Gain_ loss of sex drive,I was on Jasmine for 6 months and then switched to the patch because I sometimes I forgot to take my pills. I started using the patches at the time I turned 25. In the months to follow I started gaining weight even though I go to gym 60-90 minutes most days and follow a very sensible diet. I thought it was because I am getting a bit older_ and even joked with my friends that I started gaining weight just after turning 25. My weight gain is about 3kgs (about 6 pounds)_ and I cannot seem to lose it no matter how hard I work. Today I decided to just look on the net and see if it could have something to do with the patces ( I was becoming quite desparate cuz I dont know what more to do)_ now I am so happy to have found the cause of this terrible weight gain! Also_ I realised that my sex drive is very low_ that is so strange_ because I have never experienced that before_ now I know what the problem is. I will go off the patch after seeing my gynae in 2 weeks time_ I hope that things will go back to normal then!,F,25,6  months,4/6/2009,Ortho evra
301, 1, Pill causing severe upset stomach,Extreme weight gain causing incredible amt of discomfort in breasts and back muscles (where fluid retains causing spasms); left leg pain behind knee; vertigo; significant change in labido; anxiety/mood changes; blood pressure hike; fatigue (more illness in general),Individuals should know that apart from extreme danger of DVT_ the side effects appear to get significantly worse the more time you are on the patch. Maybe the estrogen amt builds up in a woman's system. I will most definitely stop using this product and will see my doctor to report the issues. This concerns all women and it is not worth taking_ not with as many side effects. It's important to consider the length of time these patients have been on the patch and how they have already had negative side affects. They should be warned they get increasingly worse with time.,F,44,3  years,4/3/2009,Ortho evra

The first two years were fine but the past year I have had this ANNOYING extra vaginal discharge.  It is just plain uncomfortable.  And the my libido is gone.  It didn't even occur to me that this could be because of my birth control untill someone suggested it. I am going to stop this week.  Maybe I'll get back on the pill.

I would not advise anyone to take this type of birth control. The mood swings alone made me want to kill myself...I'm not kidding! I couldn't walk without my breasts hurting_ and forget sleeping on my stomach! This needs to be removed from market ASAP!!!

We've had so many fights in the past four months and had never fought before then (all 10 years) The mood swings are the worst and it's taken me this long to figure out it was this damn patch.

310, 4, birth control,Breast tenderness/pain_ breast swelling_ very slight water retention_ decrease in acne,I used the patch for 2 years or so_ but then heard the health concerns regarding it_ and went to the pill. The pill was fine but I was breaking out so bad_ and often forgeting to take it. I spent a little over a year on the pill and just last month I asked my doctor about going back on the patch. I've been using it again for 2 weeks now and have already noticed a difference in my breasts. They are tender all the time and growing a bit. Other than that I think it has (if anything)helped my mood stability_ and also helped clear up my acne! Finally!

311, 3, Birth Control,Breast tenderness_ increase in vaginal discharge_ maybe small mood swings but it could be leftover from my time on the shot.,I havent been on it very long only a couple of weeks and I am a little concerned after reading many of the posts. I have just gotten off the shot because it was messing with me so much. I would have horrible mood swings and I had absolutely no sex drive by the time I got off of it(main reason I am off) along with extreme dryness. I havent had any nausea and I dont think I will get my period the first time that I take the patch off (because I didnt have it when I was on the shot so it probably will take some time for my body to readjust). Im really hoping that this will work for me because the shot is out for sure_ I cant use the nuva ring and I am horrible about taking a pill every day. But what worries me is the fact that a lot of women have reported a loss of sex drive and moodiness. This worries me because my boyfriend and I have put up with enough since I started the shot.

I was on it for about a year_ which was kind of up and down emotionally - but overall I never really ascribed any side effects to the patch other than spotting. I quit using it regularly about 9 months ago - and went into a period of emotional stability. Decided to go back on_ Tried to change my prescription from the patch because of the spotting but my GD insisted that I keep with it. I lasted three terrible weeks. My mood started to swing and I was all over the place. I started to get really upset by things that I wouldn't have even thought about before. A few days after taking it I thought I was losing my mind because I KNEW I shouldn't be acting like that. It also left me bloated_ retaining water like a whale and irritated my skin like nothing other. After reading this board_ I am so glad I tore it off. 5 days in and I'm already back in stable country.

I should have listened. I started the patch 5 days ago on Monday. I got sick on Tuesday but thought i probably ate something bad. WRONG. I continued to feel sick throughout the day for 4 days. I have gotten sick everyday. When I wake up_ it's the worse. I eat because i get nauseas when im hungry anyway_ and then i feel even worse after eating! I just paid 45 dollars for one month so i dont want to take it off and waste the money.

318, 4, prevent pregnancy,Possible slight weight gain (not necessarily attributable to OE)_ increase in cup size,I started using the patch exactly 3 years ago_ had no problems or side effects_ the patch seemed very ideal. I gained some weight at the time and my facial features seemed to change slightly (due to the weight gain? this may have been because of simultaneous lifestyle changes as well). My problems with Evra however seem to be related to when I go OFF the patch: depression_ severe fatigue_ odd mood swings similar to bad PMS symptoms_ night sweats_ panic attacks and overall anxiety. Also severe weight loss and hair loss after going off the patch_ which seems odd.. Not sure if these symptoms are even related to going off the patch but they seem to coincide with the removal.. I've gone off the patch twice in 3 years and the same thing happened both times. While on the patch everything seems fine. Anyone else?,F,27,3  years,1/13/2009Email,Ortho evra

Third week_ I was on the patch less than 24 hours and ended up almost passing out at work: dizzy_ couldn't breathe_ leg cramps_ and numbness in hands and feet.

320, 1, Birth Control -- less frequency,Sore throats_ MOOD SWINGS (MAJOR)_ extreme fatigue (with body aches)_ Weight gain_ acne_ Loss of sex drive,I started using The patch because I felt it would be a good change from having to remember to take a pill every day. However_ I noticed that I became irritable_ I had acne on my face and about 8-9 months later I had weight gain. My sex drive decreased tremendously and I also began to notice a pattern. Every time toward the end of week 3 I would begin to get body achs with a sore throat. During the 4th week when I would have the patch off_ my throat would be sore of 2-3 days or longer (almost as though I was having strep throat) then it would go away. I also have skin pigmentation that is darker than the patch_ and I CANT STAND THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE COLOR. They need to make a patch that can match the pigmentation of individuals with DARKER SKIN.,F,29,11  months,1/13/2009Email,Ortho evra

Other than feeling sick the first day I put it on but that went away after two months or so and everything else was fine. My second year on it felt slightly different_ I strted getting sick again. This third year has been a nightmare... I started breakthrough bleeding maybe seven months or so ago_ and it's just gotten worse. It's like I am on my period all the time_ but with just a tiny amount of blood. It is incredibly annoying and it makes me feel gross. For the past several months my sex drive as plummeted. I don't want to have sex with my boyfriend_ and I don't even want to masturbate... it is so confusing and deprsesing becase I love sex_ but I don't want it! I am never in the mood anymore! And it is so beyond frustrating! And I've just realized that it's most likely the stupid patch_ not me. I am stopping it right now and switching to the age 'ol pill.

Everything is so bad between me and him_ we keep fighting because of my mood swings_ I am not use to it. I can only imagine that things are going to get even worse.

I also have been getting VERY depressed and I am usually always happy. It's pretty much when I'm about to take the patch off I get snippy and mistrusting and it gets worse daily to severe depression and anxiety.

My period lasted for 3 weeks_ and then I was spotting afterwards and I was so scared to have sex. So I never did.  I noticed that whenever I took that patch off I felt so much better_ like I could breathe easily.  I never had bad cramps until now_ my irritability level on a scale of one to ten is a twelve_ it's just ridiculous.And recently I sprang a leak while having sex_ not a little leak_ a big leak.  It soiled all the way to the mattress...I'm associating this with the hymen_ well some of it_ it was so weird because I already had my period for the month of december and I feel so paranoid about having sex now.

Before the pacth i was reasonable_ considerd a ery responsibal_ and emotionally stable girl. A few weeks after i started using the patch i began to fight with my mom aot more. I thought this might be because i had started having sex and thought i should be able to do as i pleased now. Then i started arguing with my boyfriend. Before this time we had never even had a disagreement and this was about 8 months into our second relationship. Again i thought it might be because of the intercourse. Its really a silly idea but i just couldnt figure out why every one was suddenly attacking me and treating me like crap. So evenually he and i parted ways due to the raging mood swings. I stayed on the patch. About a month later i met the man who would become my fiance. Things were great for the first month or so and then_ again the mood swings.,F,18,1  years,12/9/2008Email,Ortho evra
329, 4, Birth Control,nauseas_ breast tenderness_ bloating,I used to Ortho Evra for 3 years non-stop_ but then I took it off for one year to give my body a break.  During those 3 years I just experience nausea and vomitting for a  month or two_ but then my body got used to the medicine and I was fine.  But now_ since I started using it again_ I feel the nausea again but the new thing is breast tenderness.  I don't mind it.  It does hurt but based on practically everyone who has written with the breast tenderness symptoms_ their boobs are growing_ and well I don't mind that.  I have noticed some bloating and fluid retention on my abdominal but I just have to let my body get used to it again.  That's it.  I don't think it's a bad birth control once my body gets used to it.  It does suck at first like I said_ but it's also convenient.,F,24,1  months,12/2/2008Email,Ortho evra
330, 3, Change from pill,So far so good_ no noted side effects as yet.,Changed to the patch two weeks ago after 2 years of taking the pill (Yasmin) Whilst on Yasmin I was experiencing hair loss/ breakadge and had no idea the pill could cause this. Also my moods were very erratic. I had been on Mercilion previously- this turned me psycho!! I am very happy so far on the patch_ no loss of sex drive (if anything theres been an increase!!)_ weight gain or moodiness_ in fact I feel great. I think everyone needs to remember that birth control is a trial and error process_ every woman is different and the key is to find one that works best for you. Personally this method works best for me as I would be worried about the injection just incase it didnt agree with me then theres no way of removing it. If I do eventually experience side effects from the patch I think I'll try nueva ring next.,F,23,14  days,12/2/2008,Ortho evra
331, 1, birth control,I switched to the patch because my Apri pill had caused my sex drive to be non-existent. That was the only issue I had ever had with the pill which I had been on for 6yrs. I was nervous about all of the side effects I read online about the patch and I should have heeded them. Within the first few HOURS of using the patch_ I was extremely nauseous. Then a few days later the dizziness and chest pains started. I was getting dizzy in my sleep_ and it would wake me up. I would have to get up and walk around for a while before I could lay back down. Exactly one week after staring the patch_ I had a dizziness episode at work and passed out. I was rushed to the hospital where they checked my blood pressure which had sky rocketed to 150/90. I am usually 100/80. They told me it was the patch_ and to d/c. Within hours of d/c the patch all the nausea and dizziness was gone.

I have only been able to get one to four hours of sleep at a time since I've started the patch_ which is quite uncommon_ seeing as I normally would sleep for 8-12 hours a night. This_ of course_ has been affecting my mood_ on top of increased estrogen levels_ making me very irritable both emotionally and physically. I've also been expriancing dull throbs at the patch site. I am only on my second patch and plan to get my perscription changed to an oral contraceptive for next month. Also_ O.E. has been known to cause pulminary embolism_ stroke_ heart attack_ and blot clotting. I would rather not risk it any longer than I have to.,F,19,8  days,11/30/2008,Ortho evra

My periods are lighter and less painful than with other methods. However_ over the past year I have experienced extremely dry eyes_ significant hair loss_ and depression.

336, 2, birth control,chest pain_ sore breasts_ little nausea_ little fatigue_ cramping_ rash_ vavinal itching/burning.,i switched to the patch after using the 3 month shot for a year. i loved the shot because im forgetful but it increased acne so i switched to the patch so id only have to remember once a week.. i do not like the patch at all. its on my inner upper thigh and after a day the edges already had started to peel and it itches sooooo bad not only where the patch is but all over my leg and other parts. my chest also started noticably hurting a week ago. i thought i might have breast cancer because my boobs hurt when being touched and also when i felt around it was harder in some spots than in others like a lump inside. then theres the cramping its like period cramps but they dont last nearly as long but there just as bad. and the vaginal burning. it feels like im 5 again having yeast infections and having to put a cold wet rag down there. it burns and itches soo bad. i wouldnt recomend the patch im def. switching back to the shot,F,18,3  weeks,11/25/2008,Ortho evra
337, 2, Yes,Severe nausea_ especially in the morning.,I started using this last week after my period. I was so happy to be using it and that I'd be replacing it only once a week. I couldn't wait. But the next day_ Monday_I started feeling a little sick to my stomach.  I didn't even eat breakfast. And not only that but I was at work. As the morning went on the nausea got worse and worse to where I had to go to the bathroom and gag. After the 3rd trip to the bathroom I couldn't hold it in any longer and just let it all come out. It was worse than when I was pregnant. I took the patch off right then and there. I did NOT want to spend my day at work like that. I didn't even use it long enough to find out if it worked or if the symptoms went away because it was just SO bad. I was not going to wait and find out. I HAD to take it off. Right after I took it off I started feeling a little better and didn't feel like vomiting anymore. What a relief that was.,F,29,1  days,11/17/2008,Ortho evra

I would just lash out at my boyfriend because I'd feel so upset or angry at him for NO REASON.

I conceived my second child (not long after having my first) while on the pill.  With two babies I was terrified of getting pregnant again.  I was too busy to remember a pill that had already let me down (while I was also breastfeeding!) I liked the patch for years.  Easy to use_ regular periods_ clear skin.  It did the job.  I didn't get pregnant. Not while I used it and not in the 9 months since I've taken it off.  I should be preparing to hold a baby.  Instead I'm left wondering if I ever will.  Same risks as the Pill?  Not in my case.  Don't use the patch.  It's not worth it.,F,28,4  years,2/4/2008,Ortho evra

At first I had the occasional rash appear at the patch site and I didn't even notice the weight gain as it was gradual over the course of 6 months until I had averaged about 20 more pounds! Still_ I love the patch as it was soo much easier to remember and I didn't have any other symptoms.  As for the weight_ I've managed to lose 15 of the 20 just by modifying how and what I ate. I really can't blame it on the patch as I was able to lose the weight once I controlled my appetite.  Until recently I really had no other side effects. I just started having issues with the patch staying on and have been on and off of it.  This has totally messed with my cycle and my moods are up and down as well as.

I will normally try to wait undesired side effects out - this is by far one of the worst things I've ever put into my body. I couldn't handle it.In retrospect_ it's probably less safe than anorexia_ but slightly more safe than gastric bypass.

422, 2, Birth Control,Leg Cramps_ chest pains_ breast tenderness_ contact lens discomfort,The worst side effect for me is severe leg pain so bad it has left me in tears (Mostly in my lower legs and even my feet). My breasts are sore all the time and I used to have such quick sharp chest pains that I thought I might be having a heart attack. I have never had a problem with contact lenses until taking this med_ now they are extremely uncomfortable to wear. I am a healthy_ thin_ 21 yr old and didn't start having these problem until about a year into taking it. It may seem easy and risk-free at first_ but wait about a year and see what symptoms you have. I don't recommend it.,F,21,2  years,7/22/2007,Ortho evra

424, 5, Birth Control,Extremely regular periods_ occasional rash on patch site,I love the patch.  The only real downside is that my husband would prefer me to wear it anywhere other than my butt_ which is impossible in the summer months b/c I don't want it to be seen.  It has reduced my flow_ cramps_ nausea_ and headaches associated with my period_ and I love having a totally predictable cycle.  The occasional rash on the patch site is typically during the summer months as well_ and can be rectified by moving the patch and making sure your skin is dry when you re-apply.   I used Depo-Provera many years ago (I like the idea of non-daily maintenance) and it caused weight gain and made me impossible to live with.  The patch is definitely worth having a look_ especially if your daily routine varies and it would be difficult for you to remember to take a pill every day.,F,35,3  years,7/18/2007,Ortho evra
425, 4, birth control,leg cramps and headaches,I have been on the patch for a little over 2 years and everything has been great until recently.  Mainly because I have not been consistent with my patch change date_ I have gotten leg cramps and headaches.  I am going to continue taking it but I am going to consult my doctor and let them know what has been happening lately.  I have never had bad cramps or bleeding before the patch and previously I had taken the pill but I love the convenience of it.  I do notice the other things the women mentioned_ like although there is increased mucus using this product_ I have not gotten a yeast infection but I can tell when there is more present in my body.  The symptoms seem to vary by person_ just like menstrual cycles themselves without hormones or drugs and pregnancies vary by person.  So I would suggest not to immediately discredit it based on what someone else has said but if you are thinking about trying it then do so and see how it works for you.,F,30,2  years,7/10/2007,Ortho evra
426, 1, To prevent getting pregnant,Weight gain_ numbness in feet and toes. Over the course of the 4 years I was on the patch I suffered from 3 stress fractures and several broken bones. I have never had bone problems before the patch.  I have been off the patch since December when I realized the connection between the bone problems and the patch.  I have not ovulated on my own since December and have to get a shot each month to start my period.,DO NOT use the patch!  Take it off!  I think it should be taken off the market.  I hope no one else has to go through what I did and am still going through as a result of the patch.,F,24,4  years,6/21/2007,Ortho evra

I had no heath side affects with either the pill or patch_ except skin irritation with the patch site. The PROBLEM was finding a ""safe"" place to put the patch. Upper-butt = pants rip off. Upper Arm = everyone can see! Shoulder = either flexing my back caused it to peel up around the edges like an old band-aid or my bra strap would wedge under the edge_ get stuck_ and I'd rip it off when I went to take off my bra!

I have had nothing but problems. I feel so sorry for my husband for having such a moody wife. Before I went on the patch I was so happy and positive. Now it gets so bad that I can't be around anyone. I've vomited up to 3x in one day while being on this medication. One time I had calf pain so bad that I couldn't walk. I've also gained 20 lbs_ even though I eat well and exercise regularly. This patch has been a disaster. Don't waste your time or money.,F,22,13  months,6/12/2007,Ortho evra
430, 2, prevent pregnancy,severe breast tenderness_ fatigue_ excessive bleeding during period_ dark discharge before and after period... but suprisingly increased libido and weight loss,I started using ortho evra 2 and a half months ago because I could not seem to remember the pill. I noticed immediately that the side effects would change with the location of the patch on my body.  I started on the lower abdomen and I experienced some cramping but my sex drive went through the roof (which was not common after having my son).  I did have some trouble with it sticking to that area_ so I tried my back.  During that week_ my breasts were so tender that I could not even touch them.  I decided to go back to my abdomen and last month I experienced very dark discharge for an entire week before my period_ then heavy heavy bleeding followed by more dark discharge with uncontrollable cramping.  I cannot take a birth control that gives me the same symptoms as if I were pregnant and makes me bleed for 3 times as long as the pill.,F,23,75  days,6/10/2007Email,Ortho evra

I have lost 15 lbs since i started the patch and my skin has become clearer. It's easy to keep up with. If you forget to change it or it falls off_ you have24 hours to get another one_ but i have also read up to 48 hours. My fiance loves it because he didn't have to worry since he could visually see it.,F,23,3.5  years,6/6/2007,Ortho evra

435, 3, Birth Control,Breast Tenderness_ Nausea_ decreased libido_ fatigue,I've found both good and bad things with this medication. The bad side effects include constant breast tenderness. I used to sleep on my stomach all of the time but I can't even stand to lay that way anymore_ and touching them is out of the question. I think the decrease in libido may have something to do with the breast pain. Also the Nausea has been very bad_ I thought I would get over it but I haven't. The good things about it are shorter periods_ and much less cramping.,F,22,5  months,6/2/2007,Ortho evra

437, 1, Contraception,Weight Gain_ Decreased Libido_ Mood Swings,Following the loss of a pregnancy_ I decided to try the patch.  This was a HUGE mistake.  I had been on the pill before with no side effects.  Although my post-miscarriage weight was obviously higher than my pre-pregnancy weight_ my current weight is even higher and continues to climb despite my careful food choices and exercise habits.  I am assuming that my feelings of not wanting to be intimate are normal following such a loss_ but I find myself not even wanting to be touched.  Also_ my mood has been all over the place_ causing me to fight and break down over the smallest things.,F,22,1  months,5/30/2007,Ortho evra
438, 3, Birth Control,I was on Ortho Evra for 4 years and then stopped for a little bit and then I've been on it for the last year again.  It took both of those times to realize that I gain weight in the lower area of my body when I am on Ortho Evra.  It's frustrating because it lowers my energy and it becomes hard for me to stay awake and want to be active.  I continue to exercise and eat amazingly well_ but I really believe Ortho Evra is the cause of my problems.  I am now going off of it for good.,Ortho evra DOES prevent pregnancy and has done it job in that area_ but reading the other ratings and comments it makes a lot of sense why I've had these problems for so long.,F,22,5  years,5/29/2007,Ortho evra

Serious mood changes.,Dont get me wrong I love the convenience of the patch and it doesnt cause me any problems with my periods_ though I have noticed my labido has been gradually getting less and less and seems to increase when im on my no patch week. One day I can feel perfectly happy then the next I can bearly face getting out of bed_ I found myself braking down in tears for no good reason and this is so not like me I used to be happy go lucky and very sexually active. I find that I stay on the patch because Im too scared to stop using the patch because im worried that other methods will result in weight gain or worse side effects plus I have a bad memory for taking the pill.,F,24,6  years,5/28/2007,Ortho evra

Skin is mildly irritated for a couple days after taking off the patch_ and often burns for the first few days it's on. My periods have been irregular and long (up to 16 days)_ with the worst cramping I've experienced while on birth control (I've taken standard pills_ the progestin mini-pill_ and the Nuva Ring). I'm hungry all the time and have gained a lot of weight_ which is very strange for me_ as I can generally eat whatever I want without weight gain. That achy feeling you get in your breasts right before your period? I have it all the time_ and actually avoid being hugged when possible.,F,29,3  months,5/16/2007,Ortho evra
443, 4, Birth Control_ Period Control,slight weight gain,Your comments have helped alot_ and I just realized that the hair loss that i've been having for the last few years might be related to my birth control (googled hair loss causes and up came birth control). not sure if this is the case with just the patch_ or if it's with all birth control methods_ but i am scheduling an appt with my doctor next week to try and figure this out. other than that no other symptoms. my sex drive is great (just not having to worry about condoms or anything is a great relief) i am of course with one guy_ of course you should still use condoms if you're not steady with someone :P  but yeah_ i love the patch_ and other than the hair loss_ it's been wonderful.,F,23,5  years,5/11/2007,Ortho evra

My marriage has taken a toll with the decrease of sex drive_ I find it hard to have energy to play with my daughter at long periods of time.

445, 4, birth control & regulate cycle,minor rash at patch side by week's end,Was put on this after a four year hiatus from birth control (Was on Orthocept for five years_ where I tolerated a 25 lb weight gain that easily and quickly disappeared when I stopped taking the pill).  Stayed on the patch for 3+ years until my current ob/gyn began to read me the riot act about blood clotting_ etc. etc.  Didn't experience any unusual side effects at all_ and I do believe that it was quite potent:  one time_ I got confused and thought I'd ended Week 3 (it was Week 2)_ and within a day I had my period and had completely screwed up my cycle.  And when I was switched to Yaz last fall_ immediately felt the dip in the hormone change (Yaz has equated quick and vengeant weight gain_ and unpredictable mood crashes in the six months since I've been on it)   Was so convenient and reliable_ but by week's end_ it would leave a gross adhesive ring that was quite itchy.  And the color was so ... peach.  Totally did not blend with my skin color!!  P.S. I was also a social 2-pack-a-week,F,32,3  years,5/4/2007,Ortho evra
446, 1, Birth Conrol,I'd like to take the opportunity to elaborate a little on the subject of lowered libido. Im taking Ortho Evra at present and I dont even remember what libido is. I've been suffering from major relationship problems because I dont even want to be touched. Not only do I not have a sex drive. But the very idea of sex grosses me out on most occasions. Before taking this medication I considered myself to have a High libido. Further more I've also suffered from headaches and LEG PAINS! Some nights I've had to have my man massage my legs for a long time because the pain was so fierce. On one occasion it was so intense that I was convenced I was experiencing a blot clot in my leg. I have a friend who was taking this as well and she also experienced extreme pains in her legs. I usually have a very high metabolism and am very active. But I feel very depressed and dont have the energy to work out anymore. I have also gained about 8 lbs while on the patch. This is very irregular for me.

Not only was I sick for like a month but I was always spotting and I NEVER knew when I was going to get my period. I had head aches nearly everyday_ I had mood swings of that of a psycho_ SEX? well yeah totaly out of the question_ no sex drive what so ever. I never wanted to do anything and I couldn't breathe right.

455, 3, Birth control,None.  This is a really great option for those who can't remember to take a pill.,I started Ortho Evra because I didn't trust myself to take a pill at the same time every day.  I ended up going off the patch for superficial reasons: I didn't like the way it looked_ especially the dirty sticky edges that develop through the week.  I switched to Ortho Tri-Cyclen and it works for me (and I've learned that taking a pill at the same time is not hard at all - I just set my cell phone alarm to go off at 12:30 pm every day).,F,27,6  months,3/21/2007,Ortho evra

No sexual side effects or nausea like the pills.,So far Ortho Evra has been the best. Is does seem to fall off easy because of showering and swimming so I use a tegaderm sticky which keeps it on_ protects it from water_ and helps it to last the whole week.

Since pills are not an option for me_ I decided to try the patch. I have been on it for three years and since then I haven't had any side effects_ it's perfect! You are worry-free and it will best suit those who can't remember to take pills daily. Even before the patch my weight fluctuates so I do not blame that on the patch.

I wasn't really unhappy with it and wasn't planning on changing until my gyno mentioned how much she loved the Nuvaring (what a mistake!) I thought it would be better since there was a great decrease in my libido since starting the patch. I also had a lot of trouble becoming lubricated.

The 1st month I had spotting and irritation at the application site_ but this was worth how much easier my period was.

467, 5, Menstrual irregularities,None,I have suffered from menstrual irregularities of many kinds. It started when my son was born and over the years_ I had added on more symptoms - acne_ blotchy darkening of skin_ severe hair loss_ fatigue and  water weight gain. My Ob/Gyn put me on the patch_ and it has greatly improved the quality of my life. Following the recent scare with Ortho Evra my husband forced me to consider another form of treatment. Another doc put me on Loestrin. It was the worst thing for me. Gained 10lbs in 6 months_ bad acne_ facial hair _ nausea and headaches. I very recently found this site that is devoted to womens health. http://www.wdxcyber.com/ncontr13.htm With their recommendations for various different symptoms / side effects associated with BC treatments_ they make it easier to have a more educated discussion with your doctor.

I have been on this since January '06_ after having my son. I was deployed for 6 months and was on some anti-malarial pills and just about every kind of anti-biotic you can think of for a throat infection so theres a chance that I am just now suffering some of the side effects that others have experienced during the first few months of use. I have been having some stomach cramps and severe back aches_ which dont make being in the military easy. My periods are extremely lighter and had me a bit concerned since I had cervical dysplasia and am due for another colposcopy next month. I dont have cramps with my periods_ which is very nice. All in all_ this drug is very convienent but I do believe that there are certain side effects that could trigger in some women that others wont have.

I started it after having a baby and at first thought it was the natural hair loss after pregnacy but my son is now 11 months and it is getting worse. My skin reaction is also getting worse over time. I have permanent dark patches of skin where I have had the patch and now I have a really bad raised/red mark when I take it off. That with blurred vision and headaches I thought were just sinus/allergies_ it's not worth it.

471, 1, birth control,I had never experienced such a bad reaction. After using ortho evra for just 1 month my breast were so tender i could not sleep on my stomach. i was very emotional_ i gained weight_ my legs hurt_ i had the worst pelvic pain and stomach pain. I stopped using the patch after one month and kept feeling tired and had the worst menstrual pains. i increased my work out in order to deal with the pain in my legs and also to increase the blood flow. But the pain would come back every month. So I decided to have a ultra sound and a pelvic examen. The results chocked me I had a few ovarian cysts and a few fibroms... I could not believe it. I have never had any pain prior to taking the Ortho-Evra patch. The only solution I have from now on is to increase my workout in order to produce natural endorphine so I can handle the monthly pain I face ... I wish someone would have told me all the side effects possible prior to me taking this form of birth control. BE SAFE.. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH..,,F,38,1  months,1/12/2007,Ortho evra
472, 1, birth control,Menorrhagia (excessive bleeding)_ dizziness_ severe cramps_ extreme soreness in breasts_ dryness of throat,"Ortho Evra almost killed me_ seriously. I wore it for three weeks_ as instructed_ and when I took it off_ I got the worst cramps of my life (it felt like my uterus was going to explode!). After a couple hours of cramps_ I began bleeding uncontrollably (I could soak a full size pad in 15 minutes). After a few days of waiting for the flow to subside_ it just got worse_ so I went to the ER. They shot me full of hormones to try to counter-act it and performed a D&C. Thankfully that stopped the bleeding. I'd lost so much blood though that they gave me two pints to get me ""out of the danger zone"" but I was still anemic for a couple months afterwards.Besides that awful incident_ while I was on Ortho Evra I was constantly dizzy. I also remember being thirsty - my throat was extremely dry and drinking water didn't help. My breasts were also extremely sore. I think it goes without saying_ but I would never_ ever use the patch again and I tell anyone interested in birth control",F,27,1  months,1/8/2007,Ortho evra
473, 3, Prevent pregnancy_ menstrual cramps,Gained 20lbs_ had severely reduced libido_ discoloration of skin where I would put the patch.,Ortho Evra is easy to remember and it does prevent pregnancy. However_ it did not prevent painful cramps on the first day of my period. It also severely reduced my sex drive and I gained alot of weight even with a healthy diet and regular exercise. I just got off Ortho Evra a month ago and I cannot believe how my sex drive has increased.,F,22,2.5  years,12/28/2006,Ortho evra
474, 3, birth control,moodiness_ sore breasts,It started out just fine_ but after almost a year_ I became constantly moody and depressed. I almost always had sore breasts. I stopped using it and my moodiness just went away. I won't go back on it.,F,22,9  months,12/19/2006,Ortho evra
475, 1, birth control,weight gain of 16 pounds (between taking this for a month and the ring for two months)never had a problem losing the weight in the past_ horrible nausea_ uncontrollable mood swings_ it did not stay on my skin and would begin peeling off itself toward the end of the week due to bathing_,Honestly_ this birth control should not be on the market...it's terrible! The only positive aspect was that i didn't get pregnant. All the side effects are not worth it.,F,25,4  weeks,12/14/2006,Ortho evra
476, 5, To prevent pregnancy,rare break-through bleeding,Mental health issues seem to plague some people regardless of medication.  That being said_ hormonal birth control often does contribute to mood swings_ dampening of the libido_ etc.  For me_ Ortho-Evra has been absolutely perfect.  It is utterly hassle-free and I have had no side-effects.  Don't led the nay-sayers disuade you from trying this wonderful drug.  Everyone's different and it may not work for you. . . but if it does_ you're in luck because it's so convenient!,F,29,3  years,12/2/2006,Ortho evra

478, 5, birth control,a good 10lb weight gain which is good coz I was underweight at the time_ slight headaches_ shortness of breath- at first I thought I was having anxiety attacks but after reading some other women's experiences about this same thing happening I was not crazy after all.  I love the patch! I would stay on it if it was not for my Dr. scaring me into switching to the pill since I have developed a mass (not a clot!) on my leg.  Not sure if its due to OrthoEvra_but I would rather be safe than sorry.,I LOVE LOVE LOVE being on the patch_ you slap it on_ and foget about it for a week. It worked really well as a contraceptive- never had one pregnancy scare. But I am annoyed by the fact it sticks to my underwear and my jeans since the only comfy place to put it was my butt.Switching to pill due to the mass on my leg.  However_ if all the scandal about this bc clears up_ I will most def. be on it again!,F,21,3  years,11/17/2006,Ortho evra
479, 1, Birth Control,I was also on Plaqenil and prednisone for RA and Lupus. Dr failed to mention that Ortho Evra had 60% more hormones in it than usual birth control. So being I was on the patch_ plus taking additional homones for RA_ I had the worst headaches I have ever had in my life. I had them 20 out of 30 days of the month. Got so bad I couldn't get out of bed_ and when I tried to roll over_ threw up on the spot. Threw up more in one night than I have my whole night. Lasted for 4 months.,Finally_ forgot to put on the next patch one month_ and the headaches disappeared! Went to many Drs_ to a neurologist_ had an MRI_ and paid so much $$ for things to take care of it. Dr's should be a bit more informed when dispensing these drugs and pay attention to what ones you are currently taking. I felt like shooting my self my headaches were so bad. Never again will I take the patch.,F,31,5  months,11/8/2006,Ortho evra
480, 3, Birth control,Irritation at patch site_ major weight gain,I've been on the patch for 2 years and love the convenience of it.  The itchiness has gotten better over time and some patches are better than others.  The big problem is that I've gained almost 30 pounds since I've started taking it and can't seem to lose weight.  I hired a personal trainer and worked out for 2 hours a day_ 4 days a week and didn't lose a pound. I've been really depressed about it and it never occured to me that my birth control was the problem until I came to this site.  I've gained a few pounds on the pill before_ but never anything like this.  Does it help to switch kinds?  I have to be on something.,F,30,2  years,10/26/2006,Ortho evra
481, 1, regulating periods,weight gain_ severe depression_ loss of libido,My cup size jumped from a small C to a large D within 3 weeks of starting the patch.  I was feeling pretty good for the first month so decided to continue.  Unfortunately I became very irritable and angry_ and my mood swings were very severe.  My weight steadily kept increasing_ and I gained 15 lbs over a course of 6 weeks.  My digestive system was working better but everything else was horrible_ my weight_ my mood.  No matter how much I changed my diet and exercised the weight wouldn't come off and I didn't feel any better.  I lost all of the weight and regained my self-confidence in 2 months after getting off it.  I will try the pill next time.,F,20,4  days,10/25/2006,Ortho evra
482, 2, birth control,sore breasts all day long_ accompanied by EXTREME sore breasts at night -- too painful to move when sleeping/in bed. I would wake up when I moved because I was in so much pain. Terrible cramps throughout the month_ nausea/headache first few weeks_ vaginal dryness during third patch week_ rash around patch_ lower libido than on depo provera.,I changed to the patch after a few years on depo provera. I loved depo but I figured I should give my body a rest on it as well I wanted to see if I would get a higher libido as it decreased a lot on depo. I had problems with the patch from day one as described in the side effects and I don't think I'd use it again. I also had quite a bit of problems keeping the patch stuck on all the time...the edges collected lint and black grungy stuff and it loosened in the shower a few times.  I wasn't 100% certain that it was going to protect me from pregnancy the way it should so I continued using condoms as well just to be sure. I don't think this form of birth control is right for my body. I am currently on my third patch week (taking it off in a day) and I've gone back to my doctor and gotten the depo provera shot again as I found it worked well for me.,F,25,2  days,10/24/2006,Ortho evra

484, 4, birth control regulation of mentrat,vaginal dryness_ low libido,I really like the patch. The low libido upsets me though. Even worse than that_ the dryness. No matter what I need supplemental lubrication. It seems to be a common theme that after a couple years the side effects worsen. Especially the low libido and dryness. I'm just glad I'm not the only one_ I was ready to see a marriage counsler.,F,23,2  years,10/14/2006Email,Ortho evra

487, 1, birth control,extreme nausea_ vomiting,I've used the patch in the past & so was familiar with nausea_ especially the first patch of the cycle or the first day or two of the patch. However_ this was too much and I'm giving it up. This nausea & vomiting isn't worth it. It's been 24 hours and I just ripped it off. Oh well - I hope it works for someone else...,F,37, ,9/30/2006,Ortho evra
488, 4, BIRTH CONTROL,Bloating_ breast tenderness_ cravings,"I've been on the patch for over 2.5 years now.  I recently switched to the NUVA RING_ stayed on that for 3 mos_ hated it_ and now I'm back on the patch.  It's great_ easy and I love it.  My periods would vary from month to month.  Some months it would be like a day or two period_ and others it would be 5-7 days. I hate that part... still a little irregular_ but at least I know the week it'll come.  Sex drive is all out of whack since I did the switch back to the patch.  I'm now thinking about switching to a pill also for the safety reasons and insurance doesn't cover this...$50 a month adds up!  good luck to those considering it.

I have gained weight since I've been on it_ but I attributed it to other factors. After reading what everyone else has said_ I'm not sure if the patch has caused this or not. I do love how on schedule my period is every month. I used to be irregular_ but now know exactly when I'll get it.

I have been on BC pills since I was 19_ only off to have children.  My gyn in her infinite wisdom has me trying new BC.  Forget this.  I also tried the Ortho lo and Yasmine.  Hated those too.

I hope my drive comes back! But worstly_ I was one of the women who suffered a pulmonary embolism and I nearly died due to blood clots that suddenly struck me in my lungs. I do not smoke or drink and am 25 years old with no prior medical history of clotting and not in my family either. GET OFF THE PATCH TO SAVE YOUR LIFE! People ARE dying on this drug!

497, 1, Birth Control,Headaches_ numbness in legs_ mood swings_ low sex drive_ hair loss_ weight gain,I thought this would be an easy way to use birth control.  The side effects started around the 3rd month or so_ but I did not attribute them to the birth control until after I quit using it.  I stopped because I heard about the increased risks of blood clots during its use.  I then realized that this thing was making me nuts.  I was paranoid with mood swings in a matter of minutes.  I had wondered what was wrong with me and if maybe I was bipolar.  My feet and legs would go numb a few times a week_ I gained about 20 pounds_ and had really bad headaches. I have been off the patch for 2 months and things are much better_ although the first few weeks off the patch the side effects were still very apparent. I would recommend anyone using this to take it off.,F,28,8  months,8/10/2006,Ortho evra

He actually timed the fight....and it was dead on,It worked.. It was easier to remember and I never gained weight. Mood swings were just terrible. What's funny is that my boyfriend's ex before me went on it and when she went on it thats when things for them became rotten... Only other bad thing is the bandaid marks around the patch.

In 9 months_ I have gained over 15 pounds!!!  My breast are always tender_ and I am always tired.  Regardless of how much sleep I get.

501, 5, birth control/ pain medication,I used to get really sick the first day of my period - so sick that sometimes I couldn't work or go to school.  I went on birth control to reduce the amount of pain and length of my periods.  I also went on birth control because I was getting married in a few month and we didn't plan on having children until later in our marriage.  I have been on birth control for about 5 years now.  I was first on Ortho Tricyclen. Then I went to Triphasal due to a change in insurance and then I decided to go on the patch since it was easier to remember than the pill.  However_ we have decided to start getting ready for having kids so I just went off the patch.   I also have heard about the recent studies done on Ortho Evra and how it has affected certain people on it.  I was really concerned about using Ortho Evra and my doctor said not to worry the last time I talked with her.  I am concerned how my body is going to react to not being on the patch anymore.,Ortho Evra really worked for me.  I stopped having such painful periods and my skin was really clear. My periods were very light and lasted about 4 days. I didn't have problems with mood swings or getting sick.,F,28,1  years,7/24/2006,Ortho evra

504, 1, To prevent pregnancy,I was on the patch for 6 weeks_ and experienced breast tenderness immediately_ and totally lost my libido.  What's the point of taking birth control if it eliminates your desire to have sex !?!  I also gained 15 lbs in 6 weeks and became as dry as the Sahara desert.  I'd cry at anything the first month on the patch_ and became severely depressed.,My recommendation is to immediately rip the patch off of your body.  I wish my doctor had told me about the extremely high levels of estrogen in the patch before she prescribed it to me.  Now that I found out that infertility is a side effect_ I'm pissed off!  The makers of Ortho Evra probably paid the FDA off to get this horrible drug approved... My advice - rip that sucker off and use condoms!,F,31,6  weeks,7/8/2006,Ortho evra
505, 1, Birth control,I became extremely emotional_ I gained weight_ my breasts hurt ALL OF THE TIME and I did'nt want to have sex anymore... something I enjoyed very much!,There is just way too many hormones in it... get off of it as soon as possile before YOU DIE!!! This is NOT a laughing matter_ there isn't a single benefit from taking this drug.  Save yourself... and your libido!,F,36,3  months,7/8/2006,Ortho evra

I didn't want to have sex anymore with the man I adore... it was pathetic!,After being on the patch for 7 weeks_ I discontinued use without consulting my doctor.  Taking the patch off and throwing out of the third floor window was the BEST thing I ever did.  Not to worry_ I was back to normal almost immediately.  My libido came back and my lovelife became juicy again.  As with any other drug... just say NO!!!,F,29,2  months,7/8/2006,Ortho evra
507, 5, Birth Control,breast tenderness for first week or so.  *Lighter periods! :)*,I was on the patch for almost 3 years and never had any problems besides some minor side effects for the first week of use. I loved it because I got lighter periods and didn't get pregnant. The only reason I recently decided to get off the patch is b/c of all the new data coming out about it possibly being unsafe. Besides that...it was great birth control and hopefully the next one I try will be as great as the patch.,F,20,2.5  years,7/2/2006,Ortho evra

511, 1, Contraception,Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections (UTI),"""Recurrent UTI"" does not begin to describe the side effects of Ortho Evra.  I had never had even a single UTI in my life--but I had nine UTIs in less than one year while on the patch.  On top of that came other side effects that mimicked ovarian cysts (bloating_ ""full"" feeling_ abdominal discomfort_ bleeding).  It got bad enough that my doctor worried I had ovarian cancer.  I finally ended up having a cystoscopy--a highly uncomfortable and invasive procedure that involves a camera in the urethra--followed by a charming procedure known as ""dilation_"" which involved four progressively larger catheters.  The final diagnosis was ""narrowing of the urethra caused by increased hormones.""  Six months after the procedure (and after quitting Ortho Evra forever)_ I'm having another UTI.  One more week and I'd have been free of the medications prescribed to offset the pain Ortho Evra has been causing me.  Thanks a bunch_ Ortho Evra.",F,33,1  years,6/19/2006,Ortho evra
512, 3, cramps,I was on the patch due to bad cramps_ being on birth control alleviated them. While on the medication I had no side effects to my knowledge. After going off the patch I realized that this severely affected my mood. I have depression and the ortho evra made it worse.,It has recently been discovered that ortho evra doesn't dispense the medication evenly. Causing spikes of the medication to be released at certain times. Most likely this is why the drug affected my mood so much. It also has a higher risk of blood clots than other pills. I would recommend getting on a pill instead of the patch.,F,24,4  years,6/17/2006,Ortho evra
513, 1, Acne/birth control,Weight gain,I HATED Ortho Evra - the patches were always coming lose on the edges_ sticking to my underwear_ and leaving gross adhesive marks.   I also gained a lot of water weight. I liked the convienence of just a patch_ but it was so uncomfortable and worrisome that it was just awful. The only perks were my boobs got bigger and my skin was pretty clear....but not worth it for the hassle/discomfort.,F,21,4  months,6/15/2006,Ortho evra
514, 5, birth control,weight gain_ increased breast size,My breast size increased immediately once I started using the patch_ which I liked.  I gained about 20 pounds_ but didn't mind because I was underweight anyways_ so now I look healthier.  I used to take the Depo Provera shot which gave me incredibly irregular periods_ at one point I didn't stop bleeding for about 6 months.  But when I switched to the patch it regulated my period.  However_ the patch DOES fall off. I went on vacation & was in the pool everyday and the patch loosened (didn't actually fall off) and I got my period early. This made me nervous because I was afraid the patch was ineffective for the week while I was on vacation from being in the pool.  But who knows.,F,21,18  months,6/14/2006,Ortho evra
515, 1, contraception,The worst side effect was chest pain and an irregular heart beat that began mildly and occasionally. The longer I was on it (just over a year)_ the worse it got. I didn't connect it to the patch till the news mentioned the increase in heart/stroke related problems. Immediately I stopped the patch and within 2 weeks_ the chest pains were gone. My doctor couldn't even figure out the reason for the pains. She guessed it was stress induced. Now I know better.,I had also used Ortho Tricyclene birth control pills in the past and that made me feel as if I had bipolar disorder. I would go from very energetic_ happy 'highs' where I couldn't sit quietly for more than a few minutes_ to climbing into the bed depressed and wanting to die. These mood swings came so rapidly--like a roller coaster. I could be madly cleaning the house_ then catch a news preview about a sad story and I'd drop into my bed in tears. Again_ once off the pill_ the bipolar effect stopped.,F,33,15  months,6/7/2006,Ortho evra

With the patch I went to a 4_ and then 6 and then 8 and then 9. Now I am back to a 6 I think. I want to be a 4. I exercise and lose no weight. I have had increased blurred vision. I am extremely moody especially at the time of the month. My breasts are also VERY sensitive. My breasts went from a 34B to a 34D.I need to get off of this pronto. I also sweat alot. I never had that problem before. My sex drive has also decreased alot. I am surprised my husband put up with all these negative side effects this long.,I began taking Ortho Evra 4 years ago. I recently linked all the side effects to the patch. I will switch to Ortho Cyclen. Do not take the patch unless you want to gain weight and change your body drastically. It is not worth it.,F,28,4  years,5/27/2006,Ortho evra
518, 3, Birth control,Weight gain_ irritation at patch site,I exercised 5 days a week and ate pretty healthy for about 2 months in order to loose some weight. I have never had a problem controling my weight_ until i started using the patch. For the whole two months that i exercised daily_ i lost 0 lbs! I could only attribute that to the patch_ so i discontinued using it.,F,22,2  months,5/25/2006,Ortho evra
519, 1, Birth Control,I started taking ortho evra in oct 2005 and quit jan 2006. The side affects i encountered while on it are as follows:mood swings_ chronic weakness_ chronic fatigue_ bad and constant depression_ numbness_ massive headaches_ loss of sex drive_ nausea_ severe abdominal cramping_ anxiety problems_ constant vaginal discharge_ blurry vision_ and uncomfortable fluctuations in breast size. Now I am off the patch and these side effects have yet to go away. My doctor has even told me that a chance of having children is the future is not likely_ not to mention the excrutiating pain caused by the cists i developed on my ovaries from the patch.,My advise on this whole thing is if you ever consider using the ortho evra patch take into consideration what ive said and what every woman who has experienced these side effects has to say. Its not worth it.,F,18,5  months,5/24/2006Email,Ortho evra
520, 1, Birth Control,weight gain_ loss of sex drive_ headaches_ spotting_ heavy periods_ skin irritation_ bloating_ fatigue_ vaginal dryness,I had lost all of my weight from my first pregnancy and was looking GOOD! I started taking Ortho Evra after delvering my second baby and have done nothing but gain weight. I have absolutely no sex drive. My periods last 8-10 days and are HEAVY! My husband used to be able to look at me across the table and I was pregnant. Now we are having difficulty conceiving. All of this trouble so that I could change a patch once a week vs. taking a daily pill. NOT WORTH IT. Warn your friends and family_ Ortho Evra will make you feel like crap!!! At 27 my sex drive should be through the roof! Now what?,F,27,3.5  years,5/24/2006,Ortho evra
521, 4, Birth control,Very minor nausea and headaches minor skin irritation,Well i have been reading all of the comments that other women have written_ and i just want to say that every women is different. I personally have not expreienced anything major. I still use condoms just to be on the safe side i suggest waiting 2 months before you do it without one. So far so good.

It did decease the flow of my period.I am now remarried and want to start a another family. I stopped using the patch in December but until now have not been able to get pregnant.

523, 3, Contraceptive,Increased breast size_ slowed down metabolism_ weight gain_ loss of libido,I had a difficult time remembering to take the pill on a day-to-day basis_ often ending up taking up to three pills at a time to catch up. The patch was very convenient for a clear conscience. My bra size also went up an entire cup within the first month of use. However_ I don't know whether sacrificing my libido was worth it all. It didn't even occur to me that the patch caused such a side effect. I went from a having a hyperactive-type sex drive_ to feeling like an 85 yr. old woman. And I'm only 23!,F,23,3  years,5/6/2006,Ortho evra

Then I started getting bladders infection that would not go away and my feet were numb every time I would get out of bed. I didnt put the two together that maybe it was my birth control.After reading other people's comments on this page I pulled off my patch yesterday and so we'll see how quickly all these awful symtoms go away.,F,22,8  months,5/3/2006,Ortho evra
526, 1, Pregnancy pervention,Loss of sex drive,I thought I was going crazy_ but a little bit after I started to use the patch_ I lost my sex drive.

527, 3, birth control,depression_ slight skin irritation,ORtho evra is great if you do not have issues with depresion or emotionalism. i loved that i could put it on once a week and not have to worry about remembering every day. however_ my mental state became extremely irritable and i became increasingly emotional and as a result after 5 months i decided to discontinue use! i am going back to the pill.,F,23,5  months,4/13/2006,Ortho evra
528, 1, birth control,Severe depressionHeadachesNausea,Soon after using the patch_ I started getting very bad headaches and would get very nauseated.  I also normally have no problems with depression- but got so depressed I was scared.  When I told my husband I was going to make an appt. with a psychiatrist (for the first time ever) for depression treatment- he looked up the patch side effects and insisted I take it off immediately.  I did not put the two together.  I am slowly getting back to normal.  WAY TOO MUCH HORMORNE in this patch- risks are just too high_ go with something else.,F,29,2.5  months,4/12/2006,Ortho evra

I starting the patch 2 years ago because I have add and have trouble remembering to take a pill. It was great and so convenient. However_ my libido has gradually decreased and has become practically non-existant. 3-months after I started the patch I was diagnosed with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and in the 2 years I have gained 30 pounds. My bra size has gone from a 34C to a 36D and my breasts are always sensitive to touch. I have dryness during intercourse and a heavy discharge during the rest of the time. The last straw was when my blood pressure started to become a problem. I did reasearch and realized all of the health problems I have been having were probably because of the 60% higher dosage of estrogen these patches put out. I am switching back to a low-estrogen pill. Forget convenience_ I want to enjoy sex with my husband again.,F,28,2  years,4/5/2006,Ortho evra

532, 2, regulating menstruation,migraines_ vaginal infections_ crying spells_ abdominal cramps_ moodiness_ heavy bleeding during period_ severe cramps during period,I've been on ortho evra for almost 2 years and from the beginning started having some of these symptoms but never made the connection.  I've been to many doctors many times complaining about these symptoms but doctors never made the connection either.  They just give me a pill for whatever is bothering me and send me away.  I've had ultrasounds and a colonoscopy to figure out what my abdominal pains are coming from.  Those came out normal.  I've been doing research on the patch lately and noticed that others have complained of these problems.  I will be going to my doctor next week to see what she's says and I want to be done with hormonal birth control all together,F,27,1  days,3/27/2006,Ortho evra
533, 1, contraception,"blood clots in lungsHoly heck_ ladies_ pay attention to those warnings: ""may increase risk of heart attack_ stroke_ or blood clots."" Those potentially FATAL side effects are rare but NOT unheard of. Do you know what a pulmonary blood clot feels like? Neither did I. It happened to me twice in the space of a month_ and the first time I went to see my dr.--the very one who prescripted the patch--and she didn't realize what it was. I do not smoke.",The irony is that I went on the Patch because I have ADD and I have a heck of a time remembering to take a pill every day. Now I hve to take blood thinners every day to prevent blood clots (and I will be contraindicated for hormonal contraception for the rest of my reproductive life_ which really sucks).,F,37,5  months,3/9/2006,Ortho evra
534, 4, birth control,Some weight gain_ headaches_ cramps_ really I loved the patch! Most of the symptoms were very minor. I used to do archaeology in FL_ and believe me_ the patch stays put!,I recently went off Ortho Evra_ and I experienced a lot of the symptoms other people described. Depression is a big one_ but also very bad headaches and nausea. I thought at first I was pregnant but it became more and more painful.,F,25,2  years,3/6/2006,Ortho evra

I've been on the patch for 3 months and i have been misreable.  No matter how much sleep i can't i look tired constantly.  I am very moody_ i get nauseas all the time_  i get frequent headaches overall i feel sick on the patch. I also fell into a depression because of the patch.  i cannot wait to finish this last month so that i can get off the patch.  After all the changes that i've seen in myself i would not recommend the patch to anyone.,F,19,3  months,1/18/2006,Ortho evra
538, 3, birth control/cysts in ovaries,I had no side effects at first.  After 2 years I noticed a drastic reoccurence of bladder infections so the doctor took me off the patch.  Now being off the patch has caused all the symptoms some people have getting on it.  I experience moodiness_ that may have turned into full-blown depression. The drug company doesn't have any information available about withdrawal symptoms.  No one seems to have any information on that.  I have found several other people who have postings similar to this one. Anyone else?,,F,28,2.5  years,1/17/2006,Ortho evra
539, 1, To Prevent Pregnancy,Significant weight gain_ dibilitating migraines_ nausea and PREGNANCY!,Although Ortho Evra is indeed convenient_ I had SEVERE side effects. I began taking it when I got married_ used it for a year and dealt with the migraines_ weight gain_ and nausea... but the last thing I thought I'd deal with was a pregnancy. I got severly ill for two months because I got pregnant while using the patch and didn'r know it. I had the most unbarable abdominal pain and continously went to the doctor_ where they never once even addressed the issue of possibly being pregnant... because I was on birth control! I didn't find out I was pregnant until I had a miscarriage and lost the baby. As if that wasn't enough_ because got pregnant on the patch and didn't know it_ and I continued to use it_ it caused severe damage to my body. I began noticing that everytime I went to the bathroom_ the entire toilet would be filled with bright red blood. I had blood in my stools for 19 days and had to have a colonoscopy done to make sure I didn't have colon cancer. This was the most horrifyin,F,19,1  years,1/16/2006,Ortho evra

It's very convenient and I didn't mind the dreaded ""lint-ring.""  However_ I noticed a slow_ but steady_ decline in my libido over the course of a year.  So slow that I almost didn't notice it...until it was gone.  Now with all the recent studies showing that libido decreases can last a long time (or possibly indefinitely!!!)_ I would warn any woman about taking this method of bc.  And_ young ladies_ please don't let your doctor pressure you into taking this because it's convenient_ easy_ blah_ blah_ etc.  It's not worth it.  Trust me.",F,28,2  years,1/5/2006,Ortho evra
541, 1, ,Mood swings_ Breast growth_ migranes (rarely),First off_ the newly discovered blood clots risk has me worried. Also_ the 60% more estrogen intake sounds terrible for a woman's body_ and could explain what has been by far the worst side effect of this method of Birth Control: Mood Swings.I didn't notice them much at first_ but my boyfriend has and they have become so severe that it is interfering with our relationship. I am also having much more of an issue when it comes to coping with regular stresses of life_ such as college.I could go from normal and relaxed to sullen and depressed or crying- and over the stupidest things. It's like living in permanent state of PMS. About to go off the patch_ so not sure how long it will take for such symptoms to wear off. Anyone who is prone to bouts of regular or clinical depression_ or anxiety_ or has bi-polar disorder_ BEWARE. The patch could add to the problem as it had done to me. ,F,17,15  months,1/4/2006,Ortho evra
542, 5, chronic headaches,Before Ortho Evra_ I had life altering headaches every single day.  I saw 8 specialists and was on a long list of meds over the course of 7 years and tried several alternative treatments as well.  The headaches were so severe that I couldn't work or go to school and every day was something to simply make it through.  This is the only thing that has relieved the pain and related symtoms.  It has given me a new lease on life.,It is possible that this drug is filling a deficiency that I may naturally have that may be causing an overload in women with normal horomones.

After seeing in news that people were having this symptom_ i quit taking it and shortness of breathe went away.,Besides the breathing issue_ It worked great with regulating my periods. Mild breakthrough bleeding in 1st month. The area where i put the patch would get stuck on my panties and jeans  if one of the edges of the patch comes off.  I ripped it completely off on time pulling my pants off-hurt like hell. Would reccommend for bc and cramps though-did not have any problems at all!,F,25,6  months,12/24/2005,Ortho evra

Depression and anxiety has led me to see a medical professional to help me get my life back. I gained 15 pounds while using the patch_ and my sex drive had diminished significantly. I stopped using the patch 5 months ago (because we wanted to have a baby_ but my periods are very irregular - ranging from 26 to 38+ (no menstruation this month yet_ but not pregnant) days. Now I'm concerned that I may never get pregnant again.,F,38,6  months,12/15/2005,Ortho evra
547, 4, Birth control,Tiredness_ headaches that turned into migrains_ Sickness_ vomiting_ weight gain_ breast size increase.,I love the patch with one stipulation. I am very aware that no one should drink alcohol while on medication_ but as I just turned 21..thats unlikely to happen. haha. I never had a problem before I started using the patch I could drink all night and not get hung over_ but afterwards if I drink any more then a quarter of what I used to drink I wake up the next morning and vomit all day. I'm using regular Ortho and have been thinking of switching to Ortho Low as my body needs less of any medication given. HOPEFULLY this will fix the vomiting issue. Other then that the patch is a god sent. No more pills you can only remember half the time!!,F,21,13  months,12/14/2005,Ortho evra
548, 2, birth control,breast tenderness_ loss of sexual desire,This made my breasts so SORE!  I also hated the way that the patch would start to peel at the edges and leave black marks all around the edge.  It looked so ugly and dirty!  I was constantly afraid it would fall off (even though it never did).  I would never wear this where anybody could see it because it was so unattractive.,F,21,6  months,12/14/2005,Ortho evra
549, 1, Birth Control,Horrible stomach cramps_ weight gain/severe bloating_ back ache_ fatigue.,I have always been very healthy_ but ever since I started using the patch I have been experiencing debilitating stomach pain and high levels of fatigue. I have also read some forums about some women who experience infertility after using the patch. This drug seems too questionable to continue using.,F,34,2.5  years,12/10/2005,Ortho evra
550, 3, I dislike taking pills - any pills.,Weakness and pain in legs. Decrease in sex-drive. Weight gain.,I have been taking Ortho Evra for some time with no real side effects. I heard the reports that suggest Otho Evra exposes you to 60% more estrogen and decided I would switch my perscription back to the pill. I continued to use the patch for another few weeks until I had time to speak to my OBGYN. On my patch change day I took the patch off_ showered and forgot to put the new patch on. I discovered it 36 hours later and put a new patch on. Within minutes it was burning and itching at the patch site. My eyes also began to burn and go blood shot so I took the patch off and immeditaly discontinued use of the patch (during my second week). I have since had increased pain and weakness in my legs and one of the heaviest periods of my life. Other than that_ I found ortho evra to be an excellent medication and hope that the maker will fix the issues with it.,F,24,10  months,12/9/2005,Ortho evra

It took me 3 years to get any kind of sex drive back.I was on the patch for that 3 years in between. Now as I have switched back to the pill_ which is too easy to forget_ it's been 13 days and already I forgot 2 mornings and took them 8 hours after I normally do. I have my period with 15 days worth of pills left which would mean I'm 12 days early? Can my body detect such a low level of estrogen after being on the patch for 3 years? and what's to say that it doesn't work like fertility drugs with the excess hormones and cause you to ovulate more eggs because it's not detecting the hormone? Yet there is little to no information available about switching back to t,F,28,3  years,12/2/2005Email,Ortho evra
554, 4, to prevent pregnancy,The main side effect I have had is that the patch leaves dark spots after I have taken them off for weeks afterwards. I just started using the patch in early November and have found that there are dark spots from where I placed each patch. I'm unsure how long it will take to fade_ but after 4+ weeks I still have dark marks.,I have not had any other side effects from this method of birth control.

The patch was convenient but mine DID fall off twice and I felt horrible every morning.  The upset stomach is what finally made me stop using the patch.

April '04) I loved it!  However_ I didn't know the increased side effects or the increased amount of estrogen.  Now_ there is all this information coming out.  Please listen to it.  I am way too young for this stuff.,F,26,6  months,11/23/2005,Ortho evra

I am freaked and decided to go off.  I was going to wait wait until week 3 but could not see putting on anymore until they lower the levels.  I hope they do because this was a good method me.

559, 5, birth control,After 2 months of wearing the patch I started getting the most severe headaches of my life_ they were so bad I could no longer leave the house.  I had no idea what was wrong with.  I would get vertigo at night and blurred vision.  Sometimes I had trouble focusing and driving.  I couldn't concentrate at work.,Even after I removed the patch_ my symptoms continued.  Now a few months later I am feeling better.  I will never put another form of birth control in my body.  I don't trust the FDA to protect me from these drugs.  The side effects are so apparent.,F,26,3  days,11/16/2005,Ortho evra

They were not painful but *very* worrisome.,I hadn't any problems with the Pill but decided to switch to the Patch for convenience. I had never had cysts before_ so I was very concerned when they started to develop. I had many of the cysts drained_ but after the problem persisted_ I switched back to the Pill. Within a month of going off the Patch_ my cysts were gone. I believe my body reacted poorly to the increased level of estrogen that is delivered by the patch.,F,34,10  months,11/16/2005,Ortho evra

It's done a wonderful job of protection for me. I also use it straight through (spotting occurs about every 2.5 months_ so I start my period then).

I was crazy the first month_ and even afterwards I never felt as good as I had before I started using it.  I never had problems with the patch staying on (if you shave the area then swab it with alcohol it stays on really well)_ but never liked that sticky-lint ring around the edge.  I quit using it when the patches started creating dark squares that lasted for a long time afterward...my last one took two months to disappear completely!

It's great to use if you want to regulate your periods. My recommendation is that you don't go longer than 3 months without having a period (using the patch back-to-back-to-back)because you'll feel like s***. I hate taking pills_ and i've tried the Depo shot (2 thumbs down DON'T USE IT!!)_ and I wish there was something else to use!! I guess until that day comes I'll keep using the patch.",F,28,2  years,10/31/2005Email,Ortho evra
573, 3, birth control,did not use for very long due to the allergic rash I had where the patch was placed.  It turned bright red and did not totally go away for a couple of months.,,F,25,2  months,10/20/2005,Ortho evra
574, 3, Cramps,painful_ irritating burn marks on skin where patch was placed that lasted a couple weeksMoodiness and Irritability,It did help the cramps but i switched to the pill and it is much better. i found it doesnt have any side effects,F,16,12  months,10/19/2005,Ortho evra
575, 2, Mennoraghia,Heavy_ prolonged period.  Painful back cramps. Bloodshot eyes. Pain in legs. Breast tenderness,Called the Dr. and explained my symptoms they told me to remove the current patch and discontinue use and stated that a lot of patients have been having similiar complaints...she stated the bleeding I have is not considered breakthrough bleeding.  Wish it would have worked for me because aside from all the side effects it was much better than remembering to take a daily pill,F,28,2  weeks,10/12/2005,Ortho evra
576, 3, contraception,nausea and vomiting_ headaches.,i'm very sensitive to the pill so the patch has less side effects than i've previously experienced but the nausea is quite extreme_ especially in the first patch of the cycle. however_ i do still have the mood swings and a loss of interest in sex which i've experienced on the pill and may forego this method due to that.,F,31,3  months,10/11/2005,Ortho evra
577, 3, regulation of menstruation,I have had a rash type reaction at the patch site.  I have to move the patch to a different location each time I change it.  It has worked wonders to regulate my cycle.  I have since developed migraines that are beyond description.  They have me in the emergency room and doctor's office on a regular basis.,I have researched the patch and found that a lot of users have the same side effects I have including blurred vision_ severe migraines and numbness/tingling in the legs and arms.  I think that with all new drugs_ users take a risk.  But I would have appreciated being more informed than I was about the possible side effects.  When I would seek medical help for my symptoms_ none of the drs. or nurses made any connection between my birth control and the symptoms.  I had to do independent research to figure out what was causing these problems.  Even when I took back my findings to the drs. they overlooked them as though I couldn't possibly know more than they did.  I have been prescribed Imitrex to use to combat the migraines but I'm not sure that it will help since I can use no other form of birth control except the patch.,F,23,3  days,10/5/2005Email,Ortho evra
578, 5, birth control,Breast tenderness,I would highly recommend ortho evra.For me it is a worry free form of birth control.I was always forgetting to take the pill.Lifes to short to worry about pregnancy everyday.I was probably one of the many out there who smoked while on the patch and i experienced no side effects..i have since quit.,F,34,4  years,10/1/2005,Ortho evra
579, 3, too forgetful for the daily pills,breast tenderness increased my bra cup one whole size_ decreased sex drive_ irritation around patch_ moodiness,,F,23,6  months,10/1/2005,Ortho evra
580, 1, Birth Control,I got pregnant_ and develop some rashes toward the patches,It's good that it helps with the cramping_ acne_ and heavy bleeding_ however_ one must caution against the possibility of being pregnant if one develops allergies to this drug.,F,23,3  years,9/6/2005,Ortho evra
581, 4, birth control,mild skin sensitivity_ somewhat itchy at patch site.  Severe headaches have started since I began using the patch.  Very very severe_ so much so they are absolutely debilitating_ I could do nothing but lie still.  Took migraine meds (relpax) and hydrocodone to combat the pain.,The combination of drugs brought the headache down to just a normal bad headache and I could resume some functionality.  Over the course of using this patch I've had maybe 10-12 headache bouts.  I am seeing my doctor today and will use something else.  Aside from the headaches this patch is wonderful and I'd otherwise still use it.,F,40,3  years,8/30/2005,Ortho evra
