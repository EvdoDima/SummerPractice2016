0, 2, back pain neck pain from disc,Originally I took Voltaren for back pain from a herniated disc_ which I later had surgery for.  I handled this drug ok_ when I was in my 30's.  I took it in conjunction with a muscle relaxant (Flexeril).  Now_ years later_ I have tried it again for severe headaches and shoulder pain etc. from a violent neck injury.  Even taking it just once makes a world of difference!  It handles my pain better than major perscription pain relievers.  However_ the side effects are the worst leg cramps imaginable.  Sometimes it takes days for the cramps to show up_ but they do_ and can come and go for over 2 weeks.  It is really too bad_ because the drug worked great when I was younger_ and kept me together until I could have the surgeries.,"If you find that you can tolerate this drug_ you are fortunate because it makes a huge difference in your ability to live your life if you have something really wrong with you...and this is your option for the short term...just do NOT take even one more than you absolutely have to_ because I think you can reach a ""tip over"" point_ and then_ like me_ you can't take it anymore.  Take it with food and lots of milk_ and don't lie down for an hour at least.  Good Luck.",F,55,25  days75 MG 1X D,6/21/2016Email,Voltaren

I completed the 7 days and then did not take it on the 8th day.  The pain was immediately worse than before taking Voltaren.  It does help the pain in my knee_ which is a strained meniscus_ but I'm afraid that the drug is masking the pain which enables me to overexert my joints and cause more injury.

64, 3, osteoarthritis,This drug MAY have caused edema of fingers and face after taking for 4 days. Also may have caused shortness of breath. Also some crabbiness and cramping (as in menstrual) and spotting. Timing off for a true period_ so suspect Voltaren is the culprit.,Took one 50 mg pill each day for 5 days. The first day it seemed to make all the pain of a muscle spasm in shoulder go away. It almost seemed like a miracle.

Had wild dreams_gurgling stomach_tired_ moody. 4 months ago my heart stopped and they said I have high blood press.  I never had it before.  I find out on the net that voltaren over long times can actually cause hypertension.  I  now use tylenol extra for arthritis. Voltaren should in my opinion be given rectally to the mfg.,It did alleviate the arthritis pain.  It also made me dependent on tagamet after a few years. ThenI find out they two are not to be taken together. I was on voltaren for over 3 years.,M,63, ,12/6/2008Email,Voltaren

Then the side effects kicked in.  Now _ if I take only one pill_ I have abdominal cramps_ followed by diarrhea_ lots of it!  Also_ LOTS of gas_ gurgling_ mild cramping all day.  I tried one more today_ immediately got a bad headache_ and cramping_ nausea_ and heartburn. That does it.. I'm going back to iubrofen!,I took this the first time in February 2008_ and have taken it occasionally since.Basically it works great for my pain_ but I can't live with the side effects.,F,63, ,8/7/2008,Voltaren

I have switched to taking it with a snack before bedtime with good results.,For me_ it has been very effective pain relief for my chronic bone/joint pain from a broken elbow.

76, 1, torn muscle in arm,It only took three pills only one a day to realize that the side effects can be quite dangerous. On the first night my heart was thumping pretty hard all night and weird chest pains. On second night same thing plus pain in my kidney area as well as stomach. The third night was all of the night before plus nausea and skin irritation. The side effects quit after 4rth night. Volteren did nothing to help my arm.,Even with a full stomach_ this pill can be very hard to handle. Side effects can easily bring you closer to the grave.,M,34,3  days,12/13/2006Email,Voltaren
