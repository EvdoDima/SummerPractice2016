1, 5, Cystic Acne,If not taken with enough food I had severe nausea and vomiting.,This product cleared up my jaw line cystic acne. I first noticed results at about 6-7 weeks. It reduced my breakouts and inflammations by about 85-90% in that area. It was used to jump start my acne regimen and I will be getting off around the 4 month mark.,F,25,3  months25-30 1X D,8/10/2013,Doryx

3, 1, Lyme Disease,Steven Johnson's Syndrome,I had no idea what Steven Johnson's Syndrome was until my fingers_ lips and private parts started burning and blistering. I though it was from minor exposure to the sun until I kept completely out of the sun and everything kept burning_ then blistering_ then bleeding. It was extremely painful and scary and everyone should know to watch out for this kind of reaction and stop the med/go to the ER ASAP.,F,34,11  days 2X D,4/11/2011,Doryx
4, 2, SORE THROAT TIC BITE,HAD NO EFFECT ON CLEARING UP INFECTION,DID NOT WORK IN FIGHTING INFECTED THROAT. SWITCHED TO BIACTIN AND WAS BETTER IN ONE DAY_ BUT CONTINES BIACTIN FOR 9 DAYS,M,72,3  days100MG 2X D,8/7/2010,Doryx
5, 4, Perioral Dermatitis,I received a horrible stomach ulcer because the doc didn't say anything about not taking this before bed. The pain was excruciating. I couldn't eat solid foods for a week. Do not take this before bed! It severely burned my stomach/esophagus. Take with lots of water_ and stay up-right for 1 hour after taking. Other than this_ no problems.,Worked great for perioral dermatitis_ and after taking Doryx for a month I didn't get the condition again for another 3 years. I also noticed while taking it that my pores disappeared and my face was clearer than it's ever been. Just be sooo careful_ it is very rough on the lining of the stomach.,F,26,30  days,9/13/2009,Doryx
6, 5, Acne,None_ but as with many antibiotics_ makes you feel pretty crappy if you consume alcohol with it.,Used in addition to a cream.  Doryx helps breakouts heal faster.  It also_ for me_ prevents breakouts on my shoulders.  Since I only put the cream on my face_ I am positive that the Doryx is what keeps the big_ painful acne off my shoulders.  Most breakouts heal very quickly compared to not taking anything at all.  It's the creams that should prevent new breakouts.,F,26,3  years,7/29/2007,Doryx
7, 1, Acne,Cleared up then got worse.,I took this for acne on my chin. After it initially looked like it was improving_ I got big thick welts under my skin filled with brown blood and muck that I would have to burst or else they would stay there. Over a year later I still have very pale scars from it. I went to a different doctor who prescribed me a cream called Duac gel. My skin cleared up in 3-4 days to the point that people would comment how lovely my skin is. Try this if doryx doesn't work for you.,F,26,2  weeks,6/24/2007,Doryx
8, 5, Acne,None that I'm aware of,I had pretty constant acne on my chin-- that painful_ under-the-skin kind-- and Doryx has totally eliminated it.,F,23,2  years,12/3/2006,Doryx
9, 3, Lyme,Mild stool changes.  Some stomach upset.  Mild insomnia.,I was on Doryx with another drug called Plaquenil.  Plaquenil is supposed to enhance Doryx.  Doryx seems to supress some of my Lyme symptoms.  I am on Zithromax and IV Rocephin right now and the symptoms are coming back.  I can't wait to get back on Doryx.,F,43,2  months,4/8/2005,Doryx
10, 3, Acne,My face cleared up at first then it got worse than it started as and really dry and big pimples_ but I'm still waiting for it to get better...it's only been about 3 weeks.,,F,18,3  weeks,11/7/2001,Doryx
