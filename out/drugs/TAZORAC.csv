0, 4, Acne scars and active acne,Peeling/irritation for the first 3 weeks_ sun sensitivity_ burned when I cried (my tears irriated my skin for some reason).,Currently 9 1/2 weeks in and my skin is improving a ton. I apply Tazorac .05% at night an hour after moisturizing_ and Aczone 5% in the morning after moisturizing as well. The important thing to remember with retinoids and basically any acne medication is patience. It was extremely discouraging about two weeks ago when I read all of these stories of people showing clear skin after only a month of Taz and here I was 7 weeks in and my skin wasn't improving_ but after reading other success stories of people sticking it out for months I decided to keep going.My skin isn't 100 % clear but it is so soft to the touch and the acne that I still have is very small scars that have faded tremendously.Finally feeling confident in my skin after struggling with moderate acne and overall greasiness for the past year_ and after trying every OTC acne treatment out there from Clearasil and Noxzema to make brands such as Dermalogica_ I've finally found something that helps my akin_ and I can't wait to see what my skin looks like by week 12 ( knock on wood),F,17,9  weeks.05%,7/6/2016,Tazorac
1, 5, Very mild acne_ pores & blackheads,Red irritated_sensitive_ preeling and flaking of the face.,Just like the other reviews on here I too was hesitant to try a product that would cause all those side effects. My dermatologist prescribed it to me and warned me to make sure I use moisturizer before applying TAZ. I didn't listen which was a big mistake. I think had I moisturized the side effects would not have been as bad. The first two weeks were the most embarrassing weeks. My skin looked like it was sunburnt and it felt that way. I wanted to quit but I stumbled upon this website and listened to what everyone said. STICK TO IT! I'm in my third week and although there is still some shedding going in small areas this medication is GREAT! I already see a difference. My pores look great the blackheads on my nose gone and even the small fine laugh line that even my plastic surgeon said Botox or juvederm could not fix is near to hardly visible. I hope that this review helps someone whose about to start or is going through what I went through. Your face will thank u for it. ; ),F,31,3  weeks0.05%,8/30/2015,Tazorac
2, 3, Acne,My skin has been dry the past few days_ not nearly as bad as other reviews have said but I'm avoiding dryness by putting on lotion before I use Tazorac.,I'm 15 years old and have been using acanya and Tazorac for about 2 weeks. My acne isn't that bad but it still bothers me since I'm the only one of my friends who has acne. I've had acne for a little over a year now and I've been to three different dermatologist which nothing they gave me helped. When I first started to use Tazorac and acanya I only had acne on my left cheek and tiny bumps on my forehead. The first few days I saw improvement but now after using this product for 2 weeks I've gotten more acne all the right side of my face!! And I'm so angry about it!! So far these products have done nothing but dry out my skin and cause more acne in places I've never had it. My dermatologist did say it will get worse before it gets better so maybe this is just a phase. When I read other reviews _ people saw improvement right away which really disappointed me when the same didn't happen to me. If you want to see improvement in your skin fast_ I wouldn't recommend either of these products.,F,15,2  days10,4/16/2015,Tazorac

5, 5, Adult acne,I've heard a lot about the burning and itching of Tazorac on the face. Believe me_ it's worth it! My derm recommended that I only use it every other night for the first week in order to give me/my face a chance to get accustomed to it. I started using it every night during the second week. I have to admit -- on the first night_ I washed it off because the itching and burning we as so bad. For those who are just beginning this medication_ my take on it is that it dries out blemishes WHILE SLOWLY BURNING OFF LAYERS OF DAMAGED AND SCARRED SKIN EVERY NIGHT. I only use it at night. In short_ the burning and irritation are worth it! My skin is velvety soft! So_ hang in there...it's worth it!!!,,F,43,6  weeks.05,7/23/2014Email,Tazorac

8, 5, mild to moderate acne,Mild itching_ redness_ skin flakiness.,After being plagued with moderate adult acne_ including painful cystic acne flares_ I finally went to my derm to be put on a regimen. She prescribed Solodyn 105mg daily_ Acanya mornings after cleansing and before moisturizing _and Tazorac 0.05% after cleansing and after moisturizing at night 3-4x a week and working up to every other night. After using Solodyn my breakouts_ including cystic flares reduced dramatically. After 1 month I started weaning off Solodyn and stopped it entirely 2 months after starting. All the while I continued using Tazorac at night_ every other night. After 2.5 months use_ skin had become clear_ bumps and scars smoothed out_ hyper pigmentation from past flares and pimples were minimized. And I had this glow. And everyone who hadn't seen me thought I had lost YEARS in age_ as it also is well-known for anti-aging affects.  Only minor irritations for me because_ I think Solodyn kept the initial purge effects in check. And I apply Neutrogena sensitive skin moisture before apply Tazorac_ only at night and only every other night. I had pretty bad Acne_ blotchiness_ dark spots in April when I started and by July_ little to no acne_ spots_ blotches_ bumps cleared up_ skin looked radiant and everyone was commenting on how young I looked. For me_ all three worked together_ but Tazorac I continue to use as maintenance. May not work for everyone_ but for me an absolute miracle.,M,34,5  months0.05% 4X W,9/22/2013Email,Tazorac

26, 5, Acne,Peeling_ Redness_ purging,Tazorac is taz-o-riffic. You may notice that I have only been on this medication for 1.5 weeks but that is just this time around. ( I will update this as the journey continues) When I was in junior high_ the derm. prescribed me Tazorac as a last step before accutane. This was actually before the cream had come out so my skin went through extreme peeling and purging. After the purging was complete_ I basically would have layers of skin falling off my face. I won't lie_ this was incredibly embarrassing in junior high but it didn't last forever. Initially I was using the gel every night but because of the peeling my derm. suggested I only put it on for 15 minutes then wash it off. This reduced the peeling and redness greatly and seemed to work great on my acne. When the cream came out_ I switched to that and was able to leave it on all night with little to no peeling. This stuff saved me. I survived the peeling_ redness_ and breakouts and returned in the 8th grade to people complementing me left and right. I literally had a girl run up to me to tell me how great my skin looked- Man_ that was awesome. I went off Tazorac because I was convinced it was having a bleaching effect on my face. I had a tan body and pale face.  I have never experienced acne so bad as I have been in the past 6 months. I went off birth control and my skin has had a hell of a time adjusting. I'm 23 now and perhaps this is Adult acne but it is painful_ huge_ and takes forever to go away. I have even missed c,F,23,1.5  weeks1% 1X D,8/23/2011Email,Tazorac
27, 5, Acne,I'm an aesthetician who has been on Tazorac 0.05 for about a year.  I use it every other night.  I have found that the key to success with Tazorac is combining it with the right skin care products.  I use Obagi Clenziderm Step 1 ( for oily skin with 2% salicylic acid) and Step 2 (Pore Therapy with 2% salicylic acid) twice a day along with my Tazorac 0.05 every other night.  What my saving grace has been is a product called Cicalfate by Avene.  Originally a post laser product_ Cicalfate is gentle enough to apply to bleeding_ oozing skin (sometimes caused by a CO2 laser treatment) and has soothed my skin nightly.  It really keeps the side effects of Tazorac at a next-to-nothing level.  Here's the kicker -- I'm a dry_ sensitive skin type who is very acne prone.  All of these products are strong but are very tolerable with the use of Cicalfate_ which by the way_ is pretty inexpensive.  Only $24 retail!  Good luck to everyone on Tazorac.

29, 4, Bad breakout,Bad initial break out_ greasy/oily skin,I've always had pimples here and there but a few months ago my skin turned it worse it has ever been. I was on differen prior to this that my doctor had gave me but this made my skin worse. So I went to the dermatologist and he prescribed tazorac to me. I'm also taking clindamycin and minocycline.  The 2nd week on this product I had the worse breakout I have ever had. I couldn't believe it and hated looking in the mirror! I was so discouraged so I called my doctor to tell him I was stopping the product. He told me that this is what the product is suppose to do and he told me to continue using it. So I did. And let me tell you it has actually been worth it. It has been about 7 weeks and my skin is so much better than before. My skin is finally starting to feel like it use to be. I do have a lot of scarring now because I picked but they will eventually fade or makeup works fine. But you have to be very patient with tazorac.

30, 3, Acne/Pore Minimizer,Dry Flakey Skin_ Very dry lips!,I started using this product back in November.  I have a friend who is 42 years old and has the most beautiful skin!  She uses a similar product called Retin A (I'm sure you've heard of it).  When I went to the derm_ she suggested I try the Taz.I have very large pores_ and have had mild to moderate acne since I was about 13.The moisturizer used first makes the product less harsh.  I started out using it_ as directed(pea sized amt) for the first 2 months_ about 3 times a week.My friend suggested I go full speed ahead and use it 5 days a week (minimum).  I thought she was nuts but at first_ I'm not gonna lie...it was rough.  My skin was blotchy_ flakey_ and not pretty.  I covered it as much as I could with makeup but sometimes that made it look worse.My suggestion is to wash your face at night_ put a small amt of moisturizer on (the suggestions here for Cereve are correct...it is a good moisturizer!).  Wait about 15 mins_ and then apply your pea sized amt of Taz.  I do this Monday night-Friday night.  I give myself a break Sat and Sun night.  I think my fine lines around my eyes are going away too.  People will suggest you stay away from the corners of your nose_ and the 'puppet lines' (the lines from the corners of your nose down to the corner of your lips)_ but these are the areas that need it to...so i say....suck it up and give it a chance.

31, 2, Acne,Burning_ itching_ peeling_ severe soreness (tenderness) of skin,I started using Tazorac on January 7th_ it is currently March 8th. Over all_ I'm not sure if I would recommend this drug. It hasn't did much to clear up my acne at all so far. I started by using BP pads on my face at night followed by a moisturizer and then the Taz. When I was doing this regime_ I didn't have any harsh side effects_ however_ I was getting absolutely no results either. Then_ I eliminated the moisturizer and was just applying the Taz after the BP pads. This actually started working better for my skin and I noticed the peeling but my acne was slightly getting better..minimally. However_ I've been doing this for about a week and a half now and my face hurts so bad! I can't touch my face without it burning and hurting really bad. I just washed my face and it was stinging so bad that I think I'm going to skip the Taz and BP pads tonight. I just applied a lot of moisturizer and hopefully it will feel better soon. I read that you should apply moisturizer before applying Taz and I also read that the moisturizer doesnt alter the effectiveness of the Taz but I'm not too sure if this is true. The Taz seemed to work so much better without the moisturizer_ maybe I just need to incorporate the moisturizer more into my routine. I'm not sure how to fix this_ I just know I've been using Tazorac for two months now_ my acne is still there and even a little worse_ my skin peels and my face hurts. ....not satisfied.,F,18,2  months0.05% 1X D,3/7/2011Email,Tazorac
32, 5, Acne,Redness_ Dry Flaky skin_ Irritation_ Burning,I have used Tazorac gel in the past_ applying it at night. It caused me severe burning and irritation. To cope with the dry and peeling skin I use Aveeno natuarlly radiant mosturizer with spf_ which works excellent and well worth the money. I also use Triaz foaming cloths both day and night before applying tazorac. I was never told to use a mosturizer before applying tazorac. I completed the process in about 5 months I used Triluma to get rid of the scaring. My face was flawless and I always received compliments. However_ I got lazy and stopped taking such great care of my face_ and my acne returned. I am currently going through the process once again and it has been four weeks and the improvements are drastic already.

For a while_ about three weeks in_ I noticed that things seemed to be improving_ but then I'd have phases of more breakouts. Right now I'm in one of those breakout phases that seems to be worse than before. So bad in fact that I actually made the decision to go on Proactive to see if that would work faster/better. I changed my mind after reading that I still may go through some of the same side effects as Tazorac. After reading everyone's comments on this forum_ I've decided to stick with Taz for at least another three weeks_ which is when I go back to the dermatologist to let her check my progress. This whole process is definitely about being patient_ even though I'm very self-conscious about my appearance right now and want something to fix it all NOW. I hope that Tazorac is worth the wait and stress. Besides_ Taz is more cost effective than Proactive and that's a very good thing. Thanks to all of you for sharing your stories.

Drink:2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in half a cup of water. You can read online the amazing benefits for acne and just your health in general     Supplement: instead of taking so many medications for acne that are damaging your skin and overdosing it with chemicals I advice natural vitamins that help the skin.  Tumeric pills morning and night and Spirulina are amazing for acne and your body's health! You can also read their benefits online.,MORNING: 1.  use quarter size of jojoba oil and massage into the skin for 30 seconds this will soften peeling and combat dryness_ jojoba oil is also great for scars and acne in general. Hop into shower with jojoba oil on if you take a shower in the morning                   2. Wash with water_ there will be a film of jojoba oil still on skin.  At this point add your gentle cleanser and massage for another 30 seconds to wash away the oil.  If if still remains you can GENTLY massage with a washcloth.  This should wash away the jojoba oil                   3. Apply a thick layer of moisturizer and let it soak in before applying any makeupNIGHT   1. Same as morning #1 with jojoba oil.  Hop into the shower with jojoba oil still on if you take a shower at night               2. Apply gentle cleanser and massage very gently with washcloth or cleansing cloth to remove dirt and dry flaking skin.  DO NOT BE ROUGH.  Do this for 30 seconds and rise with warm water               3. dry face and wait 5 minutes and apply a pea size amount of tazorac to problem areas!! not areas that are completely fine because that will just irritate them for no reason.  After applying tazorac wait 1 minute for it to sink in and then apply a thick moisturizer.  Keep applying till the skin feels calm and not cracked and dry               4.

37, 4, Large pores_ blackheads_ acne,Mild redness_ moderate dryness_ irriatation when washing face/applying lotion,I have tried both strengths of retin a micro over the last 2 years with moderate effectiveness_ but my skin was still very oily.

I had enlarged pores on my cheeks_ and blackheads on my nose. My enlarged pores have shrunk & are nearly invisible now_ visibly less blackheads as well. My once oily skin is now actually dry_ so be prepared to use a good moisturizer. I never used a moisturizer even when on retin a micro.

38, 4, Moderate/Severe Acne,Some dry_ flaky skin,This medicine is great if you use with a moisturizer to counteract the side effects. I tried Tazorac cream a year ago_ but had to stop using it after a week_ my skin is sensitive and it was getting so red and irritated it was even kind of swelling. Recently_ my acne was getting more out of control so I started using it again 3 weeks ago. I bought Aveeno Ultra-Calming Daily Moisturizer. It is a bit pricey ($15-$18) so I was hesitant to pay that much for a moisturizer_ but it is worth every penny. I use it every morning and at night_ 15 min before putting on Tazorac. It has cut the side effects down significantly. My face is just a bit flaky and drier in some areas_ but really not that bad. I am convinced that this moisturizer has saved me from most of those dreaded side effects. Probably the only way you will not be suffering from severe dry_ irritated skin. I know my skin is still supposed to flake somewhat before my acne can get any better so Im just waiting for that 3 month mark to start seeing really clear skin_ but Im very confident it will work because it already dries up my pustular acne after 1 night. Note about what make-up to use: If you are having problems with make-up looking horrible putting it on flaky skin_ try Maybelline SuperStay foundation. I have tried many department store and drugstore foundations and this is one that does not emphasize that flaky skin as much. Plus_ it looks super smooth on and doesn't settle into lines or wrinkles!

44, 5, Acne on chin and forehead,Peeling_ redness_ brought a lot of deep acne to the surface.  Groups of pimples would form overnight.,I've never had terrible acne but I would still breakout_ or get a few pimples on a day to day basis.  MY skin was never 100% clear and I never knew if I would wake up with a random pimple_ especially on my chin.  Tazorac definitly made my skin far worse for two months.  It was terrible and embarassing but after EXACTLY two months my skin is far better and almost 100% clear_ with just a little scarring that will probably go away completely after continued use.  If you're experiencing side effects now and it's making you want to stop using the product I deifnitly reccommend staying with it for 2-3mnths.  I never used lotion before applying the tazorac_ and applied a pea size amount at night to all affected areas.,F,23,2  months.05 1X D,9/24/2010,Tazorac
45, 5, severe acne,peeling_ itchy_ dryness_ and redness,2 years ago I had severe acne. I cried all the time due to low self-esteem. My acne did get worst before I got better. However_ I do believe it just depends on the person's health_ history_ and skin in general. Tazorac was a miracle!! My face literally was so clear people thought I had on make-up_ and I didn't. Recently_ my face began breaking out again so I went back to the dermatologist and they prescribed me Tazorac since it worked a miracle in the past. My face isn't near as bad as it was 2 yrs ago before I used the product_ but I definitely believe it's not all that great now. I advise everyone who uses this product to continue using it whether your face gets worst or not. Believe it_ Tazorac truly works_ but the only way to find out is to actual go through with it. My suggestion is to put it only on the irrated areas_ put moisturizer ON TOP of it ONLY WHEN needed_ if peeling worsens_ apply it every other night_ and wash your face every morning and night with warm water and pat dry. I promise you_ Tozarac will not only change your face_ but it will change your life!!,F,21,2  years30 grams 1X D,9/19/2010,Tazorac

47, 5, acne anti aging,thinner skin  red spots peeling  brings deep acne to the surface,This product breaks out your face_ causes severe peeling_ flaky skin and then after a month the redness fades and you have glowing skin. The first week for me was a living Hell because of the huge deep zits on my chin. I also used finacea during the day and I use emu oil to moisurize. This moistrizer sinks in and stops the flakiness. I have not seen a change in wrinkles but the Taz has cleared up the deep cystic acne on my chin that was so deep and the bumps hurt. It is so wonderful to wake up with smooth skin. I can not wait to see results after 3 months. I also will be using a clarisonic brush to keep up with getting rid of the dead skin cells that taz exfoliates off. I am 59 and have finally got rid of the bumps along my chin which caused me to cry-I have never had acne except during my late 50's . The first weeks are very bad and makes you want to give up-my daughter did . Keep using it and do not give up.,F,59,2  months1% 1X D,9/12/2010,Tazorac

I had A LOT of bumps all over my face_ which got worse and i'm at that point where the really bad acne is starting to clear up and i'm sort of back to where i was before my face got worse b/c of the medication.

53, 4, Moderate Cystic Acne,I started using the tazorac cream and it made my face look like an oil slick!  Also_ it dried out my face so bad (yep_ at the same time making it super oily) and my face hurt to touch and was super bright red. It peeled so bad I was embarrased to leave the house.  Not to mention_ my acne was never worse in my life during the first 3 months!!!  I looked like a joke!,The first 3 months were horrific!  My skin was red_ peeling_ acne-ridden_ and oily!  I was so upset and depressed about my face the first 3 months_ but was told that was the magic number of months to wait as far as results go.  Since my face was still gross after 3 months_ I asked my doctor to switch me to tazorac gel 0.1% and it started working better.  I think it must have been the mineral oil in the cream that made me sooooo greasy.  Anyway_ tazorac gel is working fine now.  I get a few deep cystic pimples now_ but not as bad as before.  I never touch my face_ clean it with Mary Kay cleanser for oily skin_ and clean my face 2 times per day.  I occasionally use toner and use Mary Kay moisturizer for oily skin.  I always apply the moisturizer 1 hour prior to using Taz at night to keep from horrible peeling.  I don't recommend skipping the moisturizer_ no matter how greasy you think your face is.  I also use Duac cream each morning.  This has been working for the past few months_ but isn't super affordable.  I've tried everything you can imagine Rx and OTC_ except for Accutane.  Not worth the side effects for me.  I hope this blog was useful to others struggling with acne.,F,35,7  months0.1% 1X D,7/6/2010Email,Tazorac

55, 2, Acne,Before stumbling upon this site I used this product for 2-3 days_ and stopped due to excessive peeling_ itching and burning of my skin.  Little did I know there was a solution to this problem.,I am 35 yo AA female and I've been cursed with acne for as long as I can remember. I've tried just about everything to help rid myself of acne_ and the horrible blemishes left behind due to my picking. My initial experience with taz was not very good_ I stopped using within 2-3 days. I am truly grateful for whoever created this website.  It has been very helpful in providing useful information on how to prevent the excessive peeling_ and burning of my skin. I re-started taz about a week ago after reading all of the postings.  It seems as though everyone has experienced pretty much the same symptoms_ which was good news to me b/c I thought it was just me. My daily regimen is wasing my face with Cetyphil at night_ apply moisturizer_ then the taz.  In the morning_ I just wash my face again and apply moisturizer. No more excessive peeling_ minimal itching_ and no burning.  I will admit my acne hasn't gotten any better_ as a matter of fact it's worse.  I will continue to use taz given the fact just about every posting states their acne got worse before it got better.  My biggest problem was the peeling_ and the burning of my skin_ which has been resolved.  Hopefully_ in the next 2-3 months I will have a wonderful success story to post about how wonderful my skin looks!,F,35,2  weeks0.1 Gel 1X D,6/11/2010Email,Tazorac
56, 5, Acne,Slight redness_ sun sensitivity_ skin appears slightly thinner.,Tazorac has worked extremely well. It took about 6 weeks for my skin to get used to the medicine and about 3-months before my skin cleared up completely. I use the cream at night after washing my face with Cetyphil facewash and applying Cetyphil mosturizer. The medicine keeps my face clear of pimples_ but I still have blackheads. My blackheads are really deep on my nose_ so maybe they will just take more time. I do have a question...does anyone know if it is safe to continue to use Tazorac for an extended period? I love this medicine_ and want to continue using it as long as it doesn't loose it effectiveness or build-up in my bloodsteam.,F,28,10  months.05 1X D,6/2/2010,Tazorac
57, 5, Severe Acne,Extreme dry skin_ peeling_ extreme sensitivity_ burning_ redness.,Tazorac literally changed my life. I had severe acne in Junior High_ and at that time_ all of my other friends had perfect skin_ so it was really embarrassing for me to look like that. I had no self esteem_ and I just felt ugly. I would always wear make up to cover it up_ and none of my other friends had to wear makeup! My dermotolagist prescribed Tazorac and for the first few weeks_ my skin was dry_ burning_ red_ and peeling_ it made everything look worse. My acne began to clear up a little bit_ but the side effects of Tazorac made things look 10 times worse. About 5 weeks later_ the side affects dissapeared and my acne did too. It was literally a miracle_ my skin looked amazing! Many times I had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming. I felt great and I finally began to think I was actually pretty. It worked amazing for me for about a year_ before I ran out again and I so from the on I just stopped using it_ and surprisingly my acne didn't come back for a very long time. Now I find myself in highschool_ and I've noticed my acne coming back so I've got a new presciption and I'm starting it again.

He also prescribes Premarin Estrogen cream as a night moisturizer. I have been seeing this Dr. for 30 years now. I am now 60 years old and have the skin of much younger woman. Smooth and soft with very minimum fine lines. As a sun worshiper in my youth I was concerned about sun damage. Tazorac has removed it all_ even on my neck and arms. The estrogen cream has kept my skin supple and does not have that thinning skin we ladies get after menopause.

I have a combination of dry and oily skin and I'm using this prescription along with Minocycline pills. Since I've been using this cream I would say my acne has become significantly worse and now my zits seem to be scarring.

The redness was gone. All the pimples were healed and the dry skin has slowly but surely been moisturizing itself. I wake up in the morning worried that it was all just a dream. But it was not. My skin has not looked this good in over 2 years (around the time my pores started clogging up). I am so happy with this product now.

During the first week I had more breakouts than before going to the Derm.  I'm finally starting to see results in less than 2 weeks.

My dermotologist can't believe how great my skin looks. No crows feet_ laugh lines etc. It did cause peeling when I first started using it_ but I have developed a tolerance to it.  I just started to use a face cream in addition to my tazorac.  It is by a company called yonka and it is fabulous.  I would say stick with the tazorac.  You can combat the peeling by using aquafor...believe me this really works!!  People always ask me why my skin looks so great and I have to say I owe it to tazorac.,If you are really peeling_ use the cream form.  I used the .5 for many years in the cream.

69, 4, adult onset acne,redness_ mild itching and irritation for the first week or so,my nightly regimen consists of 5.75% benzoyl peroxide wash_ .05% tazorac cream_ and doxycycline capsules (100 mg).  the tazorac was irritating my skin and causing breakouts so i stopped and resumed using epiduo (.1% adapalene/2.5% benzoyl peroxide - gel) from a previous derm rx but continued with the bp wash and doxy.  after 2 months my skin had improved and when i went for my follow up the derm told me to start on the taz. i did and my skin had none of the side effects.  i think the epiduo_ which is less potent_ helped my skin adjust to any irritation.  my skin is pretty oily so using the taz daily is actually great for controlling shine_ etc... now it's been about 4 months_ my skin is not breaking out anymore_ not even during my period!  still have residual discoloration - my skin seems to be prone to hyperpigmentation and takes a long time for dark spots to fade.  am now on a regimen of bp wash_ taz and now topical 1% clindamycin (antibiotic).  so far so good.  if you experience severe side effects from the taz_ maybe your derm can start you on a lower intensity rx like adapalene (epiduo) and let your skin adjust gradually to the meds?  (i wash my face morning/night with neutrogena face wash. also used the clarisonic brush but stopped bcuz thought skin was breaking out due to excess exfoliation)i gave taz 4 stars instead of 5 because i feel the combination of taz_ bp wash and antibiotics is what helped my skin.  just taz alone probably would not have been as effective.,F,37,45  days30mg/.05% 1X D,3/2/2010,Tazorac

It burned really really badly until my skin finally got used to it. Its good for spot treatmnet. I wouldn't recomend putting a lot on especially on areas that don't have pimples because it will make that area red. So just a little on the pimple.

Nothing else will clear up my skin. But it does itch really badly for like an hour after I use it. And the longer I go without using it_ the more my face will itch when I use it next. I only use it once a day or every other day because it is so strong that it will dry out my face. I use it before I go to bed_ after I wash my face and put on moisturizer.

But after 15 weeks_ I am losing hope!  I continue to get 5 or more new pustular breakouts daily along with many smaller red bumps.  I can hardly recognize myself anymore!  Make up won't cover the many breakouts sufficiently and there are also many red spots from the acne experienced over the past 15 weeks.  From the onset_ I experienced increase breakouts as described above and have continued to througout the past 15 weeks with no reprieve whatsoever.  As I stated_ I am giving up!  How depressing the last 15 weeks have been!  I have learned to live looking really gross and will be happy to have my old pattern of breakouts back!

74, 5, Cystic acne_ oily skin_ huge pores,Redness_ sensitivity_ peeling,I had the oiliest skin around - you could see your reflection in my face  :(  Anyway_ tazorac has GREATLY improved this.  I recommend pairing this with the clarisonic for cleansing day and night - it will totally help with any flaking you have because it sloughs it all off.  Ive been using clarisonic for about 5 months so I didnt experience a heavy breakout period when I first started taz_ I think cause my pores were basically cleaned out (just huge).  So I use clarisonic in the morning with a mario badescu glycolic cleanser_ benzaclin_ la mer moisterizer_ makeup.  At night I wash and moisterize with the same regimen_ then wait about 30-60 mins_ then use the taz_ and wash off in the morning.  So far I REALLY LOVE the results.  I still break out a little_ but its MUCH less severe.  I cant wait to see how much more it improves - already my pores have shrunk and the oil production is way less_ making a more even tone.  Be patient.,F,33,4  weeks,1/5/2010,Tazorac
75, 5, 1st signs of hyperpigmentation,very light flaking_ which subsided within 10 days after continued use.,I have generally very good_ clear skin for my age_ but have noticed hyperpigmentation from years of sun exposure becoming more prevalent. I was also concerned about fine lines around my eyes and early signs of aging. My doctor gave me samples of this cream (0.1%)_ instructing me to begin with only 1 nightly application every 3 days (pea sized amount mixed with my moisturizer). I began this regimen over the spring/summer so I was extra careful due to my outdoor activities. After about 3 months I increased frequency and now I am using it every night.  My skin has NEVER been better. This cream has clearly faded my hyperpigmented areas. I have a huge decrease in any fine lines (they are virtually eliminated)_ my skin tone is pretty perfectly even_ I have fewer breakouts_ the overall quality of my skin is significantly better. I used to use mineral make-up to cover spots and even skin tone_ but now I can go with no makeup as I could in my earlier years. I cannot say enough good things about the success I've had. Because of it_ I may go back to only using it every other night for maintenance.,F,38,6  months,1/1/2010Email,Tazorac

I tried everything from over-the-counter cleansers to U-Blue therapy.  My dermatoligst (private practice and expensive) swore that if I stayed on Tazorac it would work.  It took a while but after using it every 2nd night for 7 months (with moisturizer)I really started to see a difference.  Now I use it every night and my skin is near flawless.  Amazing stuff...  All I have to say is stick with it even if you have to start by using it once a week.  It's worth it!,M,31,9  months,12/10/2009,Tazorac
78, 5, fine lines and skin discoloration,I have brief peeling and flaking.  I use a daily moisturizer with SPF 30 but it doesn't help until the old layer of skin has been sloughed.  Kind of like a lizard.  Freckles have really lightened.,I first tried Retin A but it did absolutely nothing.  I was later prescribed Tazorac and I love it.  I use it to brighten up my skin about 4 times a year (each season).  I apply a pea size amount to my face nightly for about 4 weeks. I always avoid the under eye area_ corners of the nose_ and mouth. My skin is bright and youthful.,F,39,4  years,10/23/2009,Tazorac
79, 5, Cystic acne,none,I use this medicine every other night coupled with benzaclin in the morning and I haven't had one single breakout in months. Although tazorac can cause a lot of drying_ the trick is to use a pea sized amount a couple of times a week but not daily and this is enough to work.  Also_ it's a good idea to wash your face and apply a non-comodogenic moisturizer about 5 minutes before application as this prevents dryness.  Their website recommends this and it WILL NOT lessen the effectiveness of the meds.  I am extremely happy with this treatment.,F,26,4  months,10/6/2009,Tazorac
80, 3, mild acne,Severe peeling and dry skin.,I don't really know why I am taking this_ my acne is pretty mild_ as in I can mostly cover it up with make-up_ except for a few problem spots. The main problem with my skin is that it is so extremely dry and flaking non stop_ often to the point where it hurts to move my face at all and in doing so it makes it crack and bleed. I got prescribed tazorac though_ the lower 0.1 concentration_ being told it would help the problems with my skin. But oh my god_ I look like a freaking lizard. I'm not really sure why I would get prescribed this? If I even move my face like so much dead skin comes off. More than I've ever seen before. It doesn't hurt though_ and the skin underdeath all the numerous layers of peeling skin_ it feels like practically perfect. It makes your skin feel wonderful at first. That's just going to dry out again too right? So I think I should stop using this_ even though it's only been 3 days? It's too harsh? Or just use it on the REALLY really bad places when that happens.,F,17,3  days,10/5/2009,Tazorac
81, 5, Fine lines_ sun damage_ very minor,Slight peeling and burning_ skin feels tender and sensitive to moisturisers and sun (even minimal exposure as in going outside for a few minutes),"So far I really like it. I had very minor acne and some fine lines. I am only 34 but I've spent a lot of time in tanning beds and worshiping the sun over the years and while people think I am much younger_ I feel like I've lost the ""glow"" I had a few years ago.  I've only been using it for a week but within days my skin felt extremelly smooth and a few people commented on how I was glowing (I hadn't mentioned use of a new product to anyone)_ I've also noticed my skin looks brighter and healthier. I can't say much for the fine lines but like I said its only been a week_ I'm eager to see how the skin will look in a month or even several months. I tried Retin-a as well for a few years and the results were not as good as with the Tazorac and certainly not this soon. I did not experience breakouts but then again that wasn't really my problem to begin with_ what did happen is I had 3 small blemishes which dried up within a day of using the cream. I am using 0.05% every night (very small amount all over face) before bed (30 minutes after washing my face)_ I am cleansing with Cetaphil and also using a Cetaphil Moisturiser 15 spf during the day (no moisturiser at night). So far its worth it_ I will report back in a few months.",F,34,7  days,10/1/2009,Tazorac

83, 5, Acne_ Cystic Acne,None,When I read about patient experiences with Tazorac online I was very scared of what would happen when I began using it.  I have very oily skin and have been using Tazorac every other day along with clyndamiacin 2x's a day for 2 weeks now. I had clearer skin and no noticable new blemishes forming right away (in 2 days!!).  I have battled cystic acne for YEARS and this is the first medicine that has worked so fast and so well. I still have some that are healing up and maybe one new one has appeared in the last two weeks but I WAS getting 1-2 new ones every DAY before begining this regimine.   Just wanted to post my experience since people are more likely to want to vent and share when they have serious negative reactions - I am someone that has had no dryness_ flaking_ peeling or burning and no flare up whatsoever. So if you've been prescribed it and have serious acne I would not be scared - you may be like me and have no problem at all =)   Love it so far!,F,25,12  days,9/15/2009,Tazorac
84, 4, Acne/Cystic Acne,Peeling_ SEVERE sensitivity,It took me a solid 3 months to see great results! So don't give up! My skin got IMMENSELY WORSE before it got MUCH BETTER!

Since my skin is extremely oily_ my dermatologist suggested that I stopped using a daily moisturizer. I still don't feel 100% confident in taking it out of my regimen. How much longer should I wait to incorporate moisturizer?,F,24,14  days,8/31/2009,Tazorac
86, 4, Adult acne,Burning_ redness_ itching,I have had acne since I was 14 years old. Used accutane at age 23 and was virtually clear until age 38_ then bad_ stubborn breakouts since. Went on another round of Accutane in 2000 and cleared me up until a couple of years ago. Derm started me on this 2 weeks ago_ and I have had additional breakouts_ worsening of the existing areas_ along with burning_ stin ging_ itching_ and redness. At the end of 2 weeks_ I have begun to notice my skin tone is better_ more of a healthy glow to it_ and the worst areas are healing up. Derm says to give a full eight weeks_ use moisturizer before applying_ and expect around a 50-70% improvement over 8 weeks. Then as you acclimate to the therapy_ gradual improvement thereafter.,M,48,2  weeks,8/23/2009,Tazorac
87, 3, acne_ acne scarring_ discoloration,increased sensitivity_ flakiness_ flushed appearance,"I have suffered with acne and a multitude of other skin problems (oily_ blotchy_ freckling_ huge pores_ redness_ scarring etc...) since i was 12. Just a few months ago (march 2009) I had laser resurfacing ($4_500 yikes!) done in order to help my skin look more normal. Well_ now as I'm trying to heal from that_ my skin decided to go on a breakout spree_ and i developed dime-sized cysts along my neck/jawline. I know it wasn't b/c of the laser_ b/c my actual face is just breaking out like normal. Derm says its hormonal_(exact words were_ ""I cannot believe it!"")  :( I'm so depressed by this_ and I just stare at my skin_ with disgust. Anyway_ he put me on spironolactone_ doryx_ and of course tazorac. so far_ its been about 2 weeks_ and my skin doesn't really peel as much_ and i put it on my entire face every night. He also has me on a special salicylic/glycolic acid regimen. My skin looks cleaner and more glowing already...on my face ONLY. My evil neck however_ has gotten worse! :( It seems like one bump goes away to make room for another. But_ it seems to get worse for a lot of ppl... I just pray that this works for me_ too!

It made my skin peal almost immediately but I went out and found a great moisturizer that helps the dryness and burning.,F,30,1  weeks,7/31/2009Email,Tazorac
89, 4, adult acne,None so far,I had been using differn with some good results.  My derm wanted to be more agressive and put me on Tazorac at night and clindamycin 1% lotion in the morning.  After reading many posts here about the Tazorac_ I was scared to use it.  I am being very careful weith both meds.  I wash my face w/ Cetaphil_ dry and use Neutrogena oil-free moisture for sensitive skin. I wait 10 minutes_ then use a very_ very little of the Tazorac.  I'm using the Tazorac only 2x a week to start and the clindamycin every other morning.  I'm also using SPF 30+ every day (since it's summer) to make sure I don't burn.  So far_ no dryness and even though I do notice a few blemishes coming to the surface_ my face looks better!  I even think some wrinkles are disappearing!  So far so good.  I will increase the Tazorac to 3x a week in 2 weeks once I get used to it.  Hopefully this will prevent the side effects others have had.,F,38,1  weeks,7/22/2009,Tazorac
90, 3, Acne,Acne on face_ back_ chest_ and shoulders_ neck and darkened jawline.,I just chose any rating so I can give my opinion for the first week of trying TAZORAC. It is what everyone says it is. I have extreme redness_ flaking of the skin_ itching_ and my jaw line is darkened. I am so embarassed to be at work like that. I try to hide my acne with my hair_ and I do not use any foundation to try to hide the acne. My acne is so exaggerated. I have to let my co-workers know that I am using a medication for my acne_ and that is why it is why my skin is so red....I plan to stick with it and see what happens in a month or so. Also_ my Dr. as well wasn't very helpful as to information on how to use the gel. I still am clueless. Am I suppose to be using a moisturizer along with it? Because I haven't. Am I suppose to wash my face before use of this medicinie? The Dr. did not explain anything about it. I had tried another cream prior to this_ a year ago with another Dr. it was called Retinae. I think that is how its spelled. That did work on my face_ and it had the same side effects that TAZORAC is giving me now. I would say the cream did work_ and I loved the way my face looked after 3weeks. I stopped use of that cream because I mentioned it to my gynecologist about my use of it_ and she told me I had to be careful because it was such a risky medication. I could have no sun exposure what so ever_ and if so I can develop cancer or something like that.That scared me_ therefore_ I stopped_ and my acne is back_ and that is how I started TAZORAC,F,28,1  weeks,7/16/2009Email,Tazorac
91, 5, acne_ scarring,"I really like this med. I have used just about everything under the sun to clear up my acne. I was using benzaclin for yrs with great results but had recently become ineffective so I had to go back the derm. She prescirbed taz and aczone to combat my moderate acne. I have to say that I have not had some of the severe side effects that some have posted. I did initially experience a slight burning and irritation from it but only when I would wash my face_ this was probably due to the fact that at first I would use the cream and no moisturizer! I also think I tend to have a higher tolerance for meds. I did break out bad for the first 3 weeks and thought about stopping the treatment but started to alternate with aczone. I have now been using taz for 7 weeks (nightly) and I love it_ my skin looks really good. I know it will just keep getting better. This is one of those ""gets worse before it gets better"" meds. It has cleared up my acne and hyperpigmentation_ as well as plumped up",Love it,F,29,2  months,7/15/2009,Tazorac
92, 5, Mild acne on my face,Severe worsening of acne_ some dryness.,A warning: this drug is not for the faint of heart.  My skin had always been decent_ and I went on tazorac after a brief bout of more intense acne.  Well_ for a good two months_ my skin was worse than it had ever been; layers of makeup couldn't cover the pimples and I was embarrassed to be photographed.  After two months of atrocious skin_ though_ my acne has entirely cleared up.  I don't even wear makeup anymore-I feel like my face is perpetually glowing.  For me_ the frustration was worth it for near-perfect skin_ but if it's going to be to tough for you_ opt for a less intense brand.,F,18,6  months,7/1/2009,Tazorac

94, 5, Acne,Some temporary peeling and dry skin.,Since I was 10 I've suffered from Cystic Acne.  I've tried everything from antibiotics to gels to accutane.  None of those really worked.  Then in my 20's my skin got slightly better_ but I suddenly broke out with the worst case of acne ever on my cheeks. The doctor prescribed weaker tretonin creams and over a period of 8 weeks brought me up to the Tazorac .1% strength.  After a few weeks of some peeling my skin is now extremely clear_ and it almost glows.  I get constant compliments on my skin.  I don't even bother with foundation makeup anymore!  If you can tolerate this drug it is HIGHLY effective.  If you get bad dryness and peeling I recommend exfoliating a few hours before application_ with some baking soda mixed with a little water_ then use a heavier facial moisturizer before putting on the cream.  I also started out using Cetaphil cleanser but I'm back to my regular cleanser now.  Worked great for me and I don't have any dryness.,F,25,1  years,6/29/2009,Tazorac

96, 5, Truncal Acne-chest_ shoulders_ back,redness_ itching_ slight peeling,"Although I never had facial acne_ I sought treatment for  my ""truncal"" acne that I developed at age 22 from a dermatologist for the first time. I was prescribed tazorac and was given several trial sizes. It truly worked like magic for me.     However_ in reviewing the comments on this site posted by users who reported poor results and experiences w/tazorac_ I noticed a pattern among those who reported such experiences and whom initially described their acne condition(s) as being ""slight"" or ""mild"". I am not entirely sure what ""slight"" or ""mild"" acne consists of_ since it would seem as though one either has an acne condtion or they do not and acne is not slight. The occasional and normal occurrance of blemishes and blackheads should not be characterized as acne with a ""slight"" or ""mild"" designation. My dermatologist told me that tazorac is designed to work very well for truncal acne_ which is notoriously difficult to treat_ due to the skin on these regions being thicker_ more oily and slower to exfoliate than facial skin. My doctor warned that this medicine could even be too strong for ""moderate"" facial acne. I believe this was done to discourage me from using tazorac on my face to treat the occasional breakout or keep my skin perfect after seeing how effective taz was on my truncal acne..(good thinking doc!)

97, 5, horrible acne and hyperpigmentation,bad peeling_ tightening_ stinging_ and more breakouts. The 1st time i used it it darkened my skin around my jawline.,People need to realize this isint a magic drug and it wont cure your acne in a few days or a month. Yes your acne will get worse_ it will get more red_ your going to peel and most people probably stop using it. You must realize that this happens because the med. is going deep into the pores and moving everything up to the surface which is why you break out. If you can get over this period which lasts about a month_ month n a half i recommend just sticking with it. I've been using tazorac .05 cream since i was 15 years old and i am now 21. I had dark brown hyperpigmentation spots all over my face along with horrible acne..let me tell you it was gross. My skin now is beyond perfect. I dont breakout and have absolutely no acne or hyper-pigmentation at all. When I first started using tazoarc it was horrible. It burned_ made my skin red and my skin was very dry and peeling no matter how ch oisturizer i used. I remember eating and having the skin around my mouth just crack and peel off_ i couldn't even eat in public. After about 3-4 months os using it before bed my skin was great. the only time i stopped using it was last year for about 8 months. After those 8 months i started breaking out again so i started the regimen again. Ever since my skin has been nothing but perfect.

However_ I stuck with it and after about 2 months_ those bad effects went away and it really did clear up my skin. I had had really severe acne since middle school and Tazorac is the only product that has ever worked to clear it up. My skin still isn't perfect_ but it is a definite_ vast improvement. Acne really ruined my life for a long time_ and now I hardly think about it anymore. My skin is the best it has ever looked_ and I would recommend that anyone using this for acne stick with it.,F,19,1.5  years,4/14/2009,Tazorac

I rated at level 3_ because even though I ahve yet to see any real improvement_ I am very hopeful over time it will really work!,This is the second time I have been perscribed TAZ. The first time my derm wasn't very helpful with directions or how to deal with side effects_ so I used WAY TOO MUCH and wasn't diligent enough with moustirizing/sunscreen and my face was extremely red and peeling in large areas. Now (about a year later) I still have acne and I talked to a new derm who was much more helpful and encouraged me to try it again because it is considered one of the best (If not THE best) topical treatments out there. My frist week or so_ I experienced drying/peeling_ but now I am in my 3rd week and I have very little drying and peeling_ but not much improvement in my acne. I am using 0.05%. My acne may have even worsened_ which I hear is normal and will subside. I have heard that after the fourth week_ that is generally when people see improvement. As I am nearing this time I am praying to the universe that it will work for me_ because I would like to not have to go the Accutane route. I wonder though_ since my skin seems to be tolerating 0.05 if I should perhaps try the 1%. Any thoughts on percentages?,F,22,3  weeks,4/3/2009,Tazorac

I feel like I'm paralyzed and don't even want to leave the house without my foundation on (a problem that I haven't had to deal with until a year ago).  Speaking of foundation_ I use Prescriptives custom blend foundation_ and it is truly a god send.  Definitely pricey_ but so worth it.  People are always amazed when I say that my skin is so bad_ because the foundation does such a good job of covering it up.  Take the time and go to a Prescriptives counter and have them blend it for you.

About a yr and half ago_ I started to break out BAD along my cheeks.  Right now_ I have 3 large pimples on the right side of my face that hurt. UGH! I truly think its because I sleep on that side of my face.  About 2 weeks ago_ my derm gave me Tazorac.  He told me it wouldnt get worse as far as the breaking out but yes_ I may peel.  I am sooo worried to use it! I want to_ but I am scared.  Everyone on here is saying to use it for 10 minutes and then wash it off.  Are you suppose to do that?  My derm told me to rub it on my face at night and thats it. Well for now_ I am going to go put my Differn on and wait for some helpful advice! Thanks everyone!

I'm so glad I stumbled onto this forum_ it helped a great deal as I have learned from other's trials of Taz. I went really slowly over the last month with the .1% cream. Only applied it once every 5 nights after putting on moisturizer and waiting 1 hour_ then applying moisturizer after the Taz also. Gradually have worked up to once every 3 nights_ and will continue until can tolerate nightly. Scars have faded tremendously and texture really smooth. Have patience and be sure to wear sunscreen!!!

113, 4, Acne,Dryness,The first couple weeks I didn't see much results_ but by the third week_ I could tell my face was getting better. It was about 50% better than from before using Tazorac. I've been using it for a total of six weeks now and my face isn't perfect_ but it is significantly better ... about 90% clear. I also have scars from my acne and the dermatologist said Tazorac should make the scars fade_ but I haven't really been able to tell. I didn't have to pay anything for Tazorac since my dermatologist gave me a bunch of samples. To not dry as much as others complained_ after washing my face_ I use Olay moisturizer_ wait at least one hour_ and then put Tazorac on. I only use a pea-size amount for my whole face. My face is a little dry_ but it's not as bad as when I used benzoyl peroxide.,F,23,6  weeks,1/11/2009,Tazorac
114, 1, acne on chin_ cheeks_ & forehead,redness_ severe itching_ burning_ severe peeling,I was really excited to finally get rid of my acne. However_ I think tazorac screwed it up even worse. I kept using it - and kept waiting for it to run its course and clear up my face and it never did. Such awful side effects to never get the true result you'd hoped for. I actually kept getting acne and even more concentrated in the areas I applied it.  And for the price!!  Definitely a huge waste... :(,F,19,1  months,1/9/2009,Tazorac
115, 5, Lines and dark spots,At the beginning I had a lot of peeling. Then burning and redness. The longer I have used it the better all has gotten. My dark spots are gone and lines MUCH better!!,Hang in there to all. The older you get the more you will appreciate this. I am not kidding. My doctor told me I would kill for this once I started using it. I don't know if I would go that far_ but I will always use it - forever hopefully!!!!!!,F,43,18  months,1/2/2009,Tazorac
116, 3, acne,breaking out in places I never have_ peeling_ redness,It's really frustrating being a professional woman & dealing w/ constant breakouts... I'm at week 4: let me tell you thefirst 3 weeks were horrific in terms of breaking out.  I spent this weekend in bed crying b/c my skin has never been so ravaged. I rarely had breakouts until I hit 30 - clearly hormones have a big role_ but I've been on spirinolactone for almost 5 months & haven't seen results. Thx to all the encouraging reviewers_ I'm going to stick it out for 12 weeks.I have noticed really pretty_ smooth skin where I'm not broken out.I'm praying I'll be one of those ppl who got 'flawless' skin from using tazorac.I would love to throw my foundation away!!!In the meantime_ any suggestions for good liquid foundation while on taz??Can't use bare minerals cuz it seems to dry my skin moe and the peeling is VERY visible when I've tried it.,F,32,4  weeks,12/27/2008,Tazorac

118, 3, adult hormonal acne,Dryness_ peeling_ stinging_ burning_ darkened skin on cheeks,I had some sample packs because the pharmacy said my insurance would not pay for the prescription because I was over 18 years old. I am African-American with acne on the cheeks and jawline. I believe my breakouts are hormonal. I also get hair on my chin. I loved the peeling and smoothness_ but I don't understand why my face has darkened on my cheeks and jawline. There is a dark mask that was not there. I've run out of the samples now. I would like to fix this problem and possibly continue using the product.,F,43,3  weeks,11/30/2008Email,Tazorac

121, 4, Acne on my cheeks and chin,Extreme dryness of skin,I have been using Tazorac 0.05% for about 2 weeks. Previously I have tried ProActiv_ Benzamycin (which only worked for a few months)_ and many many over the counter products including ones with slyic acid and they did not work. Tazorac has been pretty amazing so far. My family and I have already seen a noticable difference in just 2 weeks. The con about Taz_ as everyone else has previously mentioned is the dryness_ but its totally worth it. I think the dryness is also due to the cleanser I'm using which dries out the skin in itself_ so I am going to switch cleansers. Excited to see what's to come! I would suggest be careful what cleansers/soaps you use along with Tazorac,F,26,2  weeks,11/21/2008,Tazorac
122, 4, Cystic acne on my upper cheeks,peeling_light burning,when I first started using tazorac conbined with tetracycline. i did see a big inprovement.

123, 5, adult acne_ large pores_ fine lines,Some dryness and flaky skin,"Cleared out the gunk in the pores and made the pores appear smaller.  For those with acne that persists_ try the ""Blue Light"" series at your Derm which destroys the bacteria in the skin.  Took Accutane_ had 2 lazer peels (cost was no object)_ saw the best derms in the U.S. and in Europe_ but the ""Blue Light"" with Levulan really ""cured"" the bad cysts and breakouts.  Also_ don't believe the diet stuff; acne is hereditary and hormonal for most.  I eat no meat or junk food at all (am an athlete and at my ideal weight_ never one pound overweight)_ and have little stress_ but had terrible acne; friends ate junk food and had perfect skin--never a breakout.  It's bacteria in the skin_ genetics_ age_ hormones.  Benzaclin also great_ and 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide all day (but not with Tazorac_ too drying).  Your skin will clear up--be patient.",F,29,4  months,10/30/2008,Tazorac
124, 5, acne_ fine lines,very slight peeling,I love this stuff.  I've had breakouts and lots of blackheads since having my two daughters.  Have been on this for almost 2 weeks and my skin has never looked better.  I have very sensitive skin but I think the reason for no side effects is that I have only been putting a small blob of 0.1% gel on at night and washing it off after only one minute.  then follow with cetaphil.  i plan to gradually increase the time I leave it on_ but just this small amount has really cleared my skin.  my blackheads are fading and my skin just feels a lot smoother. thank goodness.  not fun having wrinkles AND acne at 37.,M,37,2  weeks,6/4/2008,Tazorac
125, 4, mild acne_ red spots from old acne,dry_ itchy skin_ redness,I've been using Tazorac Gel for almost 3 months.  I saw results pretty quickly and my skin has gotten even better since.  Occasionally my skin does get really dry or red_ but I think thats because I use too much of it at times.  When it works well you just want to use more_ but I think thats a bad idea..  My dermatologist recommended Aveeno Ultra Calming Moisturizer ( SPF 15) and after about a week or so of using the moisturizer my redness got better as well as the dry skin.,M,20,3  months,6/4/2008,Tazorac
126, 2, Acne on face,peeling_ increased breakouts_ dryness_ sensitivity.,I was first prescribed Tazorac .05% in 2004 and it worked wonderfully.  I then stopped using it for a while because I moved and I had to take some time to find a dermatologist and I also had a baby.  I began using Tazorac .05 again early last year and again it worked well.  I stopped using it once more because I switched insurance plans. I just began using it again 7 weeks ago and it is not working the same as the last 2 times.  The last to times I used Tazorac I saw significant improvements at this point which is mid-way to the 12 week point.  This time I am getting more frequent and bigger pimples_ which is causing more scarring.  I am going to try applying a moisturizer to my face at night before applying the Tazorac to see if there is any difference.,F,28,7  weeks,5/12/2008,Tazorac
127, 4, hyperpigmentation,drying/flaking/burning,My dermatologist told me to follow these directions to prevent the adverse side effects mentioned here:Use it at least 30 minutes after washing your skin so you have some time to build up some oil. When starting use it for 5 minutes then wash it off. Do that for a week then the next week do 10 minutes on. Work up to being able to use it overnight and moisturize during the day. Hope this helps!,F,22,1  years,5/11/2008,Tazorac
128, 4, moderate ance,burning_ tightness around the mouth_ peeling_ and reddness,I've been using tazorac for about 3 and a half weeks now. The derm put me on .1% and bactrim. After about the 2nd week of using them_ the bactrim started to give me a rash (because i was allergic to this). So_ now I'm only using the tazorac at night and a face wash in both in the morning and night. I don't really see any improvement at all. I'm still breaking out around my mouth and a little on the cheeks. I'm very dissappointed right now but i know that it take time. So_ I'll hang in there and hopefully it will start to improve. But when does it start to get better?,F,14,3  weeks,5/10/2008,Tazorac
129, 5, moderate acne with scarring,severe irritation_ burning_ flaking and peeling_ itching_,I am a 34 year old african american female and am on benzaclin in the morning and tazorac 0.05% at night.  The first two weeks were unbelievable_ my face broke out badly during the first week_ then by day 10_ it appeared as if I had been severely sunburned. Everything burned and irritated my skin except cool water. I used pure 100% cocoa butter stick as a moisturizer with the benzaclin.  Once the first major peeling occured_ I noticed a remarkable improvement. After only 4 weeks_ people have asked if I am wearing makeup_ and I'm not. Not anymore!! :)The discomfort had me in tears but it was worth it. It does seem that about once a week I continue to experience some mild irritation and peeling the next morning after.,F,34,4  weeks,5/1/2008,Tazorac
130, 5, Moderate acne,Day 1-tingly/itchyDay 3-6 really red(tomato)_ dry skin (snake like_ sheets of skin peeling off...crazy!!)_ burningDay 6-13 (present) still red but tolerable and moving back to normal skin colour for me_ flaking skin,I was so scared to start using this stuff_ but figured why not it's better than acne. So after almost 2 weeks I am finally feeling like I am not emabrassed in public. The red and super dry skin was a bit tough to get through_ but it is worth sticking to the product. I am only into 2 weeks of what I think will be at least 12 of using this medication and other than the red (which is a small price to pay.) My acne has not gotten worse and in fact it has cleared my skin already. I still have some work to go but I think I am on my way to getting this acne cleared up. I cannot stress enough that you HAVE TO MOISTURIZE an hour before using this product. As soon as I clued into moisturizing before applying_ my redness and the burning started to subside and is almost gone. And remember to USE ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT...like the size of a pea for your entire face. This stuff works. You just have to stick to it.,F,32,13  days,4/30/2008,Tazorac
131, 5, mild to moderate acne,severe dry skin_ flaky skin_ major increase in breakout after 3 weeks of use_ redness_ burning upon application initially,I have been using tazorac for almost 3 months and I must say that I have had a very positive experience.  Initially my skin looked horrible and red and I broke out in places that I never had before which has caused some mild scarring.  However_ I used to get cystic acne which has completely gone away and I now get a few mild white heads in place of those.  Also_ the scarring has majorly decreased over the last month so is not as much apparent anymore.  I recommend that you stick with Tazorac as much as possible because even though it may seem as though it's not working_ in time you will see positive results.  I also recommend using Eucerin Spf 15 moisturizer with it as it has decreased the burning_ redness and dryness.  My best advice for anyone is to be patient and give it a try before giving up!,F,26,3  months,4/28/2008,Tazorac
132, 2, acne_ whiteheads,serious burning_ redness_ itchiness_ minor peeling,I've been suffering from adult acne for 5 years now_ since out of college and started working. I've had acne since around age 16_ but my first visit to the dermatologist healed me completely after couple years of a prescribed BP cream. My 5 years of adult acne I have been prescribed Accutane_ Tretinoin and Differin .....etc. They seem to work for a while but eventually my skin develops irritation again. So I went back to using simple BP wash and toner but my acne persist....so I give a new derm a chance and she prescribed me wtih Tazorac. I was only using 1/4 of the recommand dosage nightly_ it was ok at the beginning_ tolorable irritation...but right at the 7th week all of a sudden I developed a allergic reaction_ i skin got really tight and dry_ very red and itchy i had to stop the Tazorac. It takes me a week now i'm slightly better. I'm just surprise that being told to my derm my pass not very good experience with Retinol_ she end up prescribing me the strongest of all Retinol_ Tazo,F,31, ,4/16/2008Email,Tazorac
133, 1, mild-moderate acne,horrible acne that increased daily over 3.5 months of use. skin flaking off. now that i am off it_ i have many many acne scars because of it.,i hated my tazorac experience. i totally realized that i was supposed to break out at first_ but this was basically a steady increase of acne for 3 months straight_ far worse than i've ever had in my life. i kept thinking if i stuck with it_ i'd get nice clear skin like the people in some of the reviews. i really just did not see it doing anything positive for me even after several months of using.  after i quit_ my acne started to go away and my skin got back to normal. however_ i'm left with many scars. i am going to try for a more holistic approach to see if any foods trigger my acne as well as take some vitamins. it's not worth using such a strong chemical for something that you can possibly fix with some eating and lifestyle changes (which would be better for you in the long run anyway).,F,24,3  months,4/9/2008,Tazorac

I used that for a little more than 6 months. It worked great and my skin went completely even-toned and clear. I decided to try the full strength after my bottle emptied because I still had some bumps on my forehead. It then got pretty bad. There were lots of itching and peeling. So I've been on/off the full strength Taz for almost 6 months. I'm determined to continue using it. If in another few months my skin is still not tolerating the full strength_ I'll switch back to the half. I'll suffice with the minor bumps on my forehead. *Sigh*.,M,19,1  years,2/11/2008Email,Tazorac

She gave me Taz and I am also taking Monodox and said try this for a few months first.  I use a cleanser only available @ MD's office called Glytone and an SPF 57 cream also only available at MD's office.  It's been 3 weeks and I am actually starting to see some clearing.

Honestly_ it worked even better with each additional month of use. Only drawback I have is peeling skin but I will try to now use it every other day. I still get the occasional blemish on my cheek but it's 90% clear. DO NOT try waxing your upper lip...will rip the skin right off because the drug makes the skin very thin.

I used to have several yellowheads on my forehead_ but now they're pretty much gone. There's still several little_ painful red pimples. Some got a little worse_ while some got better. I didn't have a breakout at first_ but you will most likely have dryness and it can get extremely uncomfortable at first. Initial results can be very discouraging but do not give up.

I really wanted to give tazorac a chance and started applying a moisturiser prior to applying tazorac_ and it made a huge difference!!! My face didn't burn or even get dry. Three months later and my face is extremely clear and I am so excited with the results that I really don't want to stop using it. one more comment - yes_ my acne did get worse before it got better_ I think that is the case with all acne medications.

I was going to my dermatologist in Los Angeles for laser hair removal and he suggested I take Tazorac 1% gell for my whitehead breakouts.  I live in Las Vegas and the summers are devasting on my skin_ my facial texture was sandy like a permanent heat rash that wouldnt go away_ not to mention dull from the heat.  My doctor instructed me to use a pea sized amount of Tazorac_ (3) times a week_ on my UNCLEAN face_ for either (3) minutes in the morning_ then wash it off_ or (5) minutes at night_ then wash it off.  So far in 2 months the sandy_ rough skin texture is gone_ my face is soft and im no longer embarassed for my boyfriend to touch my face.  The bumps I had on my chin from hair removal is history_ and as far as the rest of my face it's a 75% improvement in just 2 months using Tazorac 3 times a week.

Initial mild flaking around mouth and slight stinging_ but that's it.  Only wash my face with water once a day_ and wait a full hour before applying Taz (I think that deters irritation better than only waiting 1/2 hr).  Use no moisturizer at all_ either.  My skin wasn't oily to begin with.,I used Tretinoin (Retin-A) cream .025% for 2 mos. prior to this_ but still had unacceptable breakouts_ so my derm. switched me to this.  It has already helped my acne considerably_ including a large blemish I had prior to using.  Made it disappear very quickly.  Fine lines are already diminishing.

I use this 3-4 times per week and put a little mosturizer in the areas before applying Tazorac that I am prone to peel.,Tazorac is INCREDIBLE.  I have been using this for a little over a month_ and the results are amazing.  I can only imagine what will happen in another month.  My skin looks great_ my pores are disapearing.

153, 5, Adult Acne and Sun Damage,Minor drying and peeling at first and a little bit more acne for a few days but that was it.  Then I was on my way to clear skin.,I love TAZORAC!  It works amazing.  Putting the Cerave moisturizer lotion on first before TAZOARC ensured that I only used one drop of TAZORAC and it could be spread all over my face.  The key is to only using a pea sized drop and to use a moisturizer first - this reduces the drying and peeling alot!  I wash my face with Dove bar soap.  Sounds crazy but I've been doing this for years per my Dermatologist - it is not irritating to acne. I think alot of people use stronger soaps and cleansers with TAZORAC and that not only causes more irritation_ but more acne. I am 34 years old now and have had acne since I was 10.  I had tried everything including accutane and Proactive.  Accutane did work_ but TAZORAC works just as well for my moderate acne now.  I have perfectly clear skin.

I have been using it now for 4 months and my face is finally looking awesome!  My acne situation wasn't by any means anything too sirious_ but it was just enough to make me self-concious about my appeareance.  I know what you all mean when you say that at the beginning it makes you break out more.  That it did_ for me as well.  To tell you the truth there were many times when I wanted so badly to give up on it because my face broke out even more.  But seriously_ stick with it and you will get results.  My derm put me on Benzaclin topical gel as well and I use it every morning.  I also use the Cetaphil gentle skin clenser before applying both the Benzaclin and Tazorac.  Apart from my every day routine_ I will sometimes use the Proactiv refining mask and dab it on a small pimple if I happen to get one.

155, 5, acne/ wrinkles/ uneven skin tone,very moderate flaking,I've had acne since I was 12. I've truly tried it all. Minocin cleared it up in my teen years but it never really went away. As I got older I noticed more wrinkles and saw my derm and got a series of glycolic peels done. At my last peel she suggested tazorac to even my skin tone and minimize wrinkles. It has been wonderful. I think the trick is to do a session of peels first and then start. Also_ the box isn't kidding when it says don't use any harsh cleansers. I use only cetaphil cleanser and lotion and so far I've been fine. Believe me_ if someone's skin was going to be irritated by a product I would be mine. You may have a favorite cleanser or lotion that did you right for years but you're peeling and exposing your skin to what you apply now. This very well may change it's performance. Another thought: don't use taz for a couple of days if you get your eyebrows or upper lip waxed! Your skin is too fragile and can be left with raw patches; and DO NOT TAN. Tanning can make your wrinkl,F,36,8  months,12/27/2007,Tazorac

I bought a good face brush to scrub my face and I try no to wear any makeup at home. I noticed the bumps and redness are going away. All in all I am very satisfied with the product even though with my insurance it was 100$ for me. Oh well. It's wroth it. I think I'm just going to keep using it every night and keep my face clean. I wash my face with good cleansers and I wash my pillow cases and my make up brushes all the time. I eally do like the product. I wish I could post pictures though!,I would recommend this product to any one with acne/ oiliness.

158, 5, acne,dry skin for about 2 weeks,Okay so I started using Tazorac .5% on my face just for about 5-10 minutes every other night_ in conjunction with a Loreal acne peel. then I moved to 1% and would do it two nights for about 15 minutes with a acne peel on the third night_ I started drinking a lot of water as well_ I think that really really helped too.  My face is so clear and it has only been about a month.

159, 5, Acne,Skin sensitivity,I had to use Tazorac for at least 6 weeks before I started seeing results. However_ my acne was on the back. Thus_ I wasn't too worried about it getting worse_ 'cuz it isn't an area that is wildly visible_ such as the face. You can always cover your back by  wearing a T-shirt :-)! I can honestly say that Tazorac really works. My dermatologist even told me that it is the same as Acutane (the best acne med. out there). The only difference is that it is topical_ instead of oral. Don't forget_ your acne will get worse before it gets better!,F,22, ,12/7/2007,Tazorac
160, 4, Acne/scarring,For the first two months I broke out more_ and had sensitivity and flaking.,I had been using Retin-A Micro for over a year when I decided to switch to Tazorac.  I had heard that it was stronger_ and wanted to use it to clear my minimal existing acne.  It was very bad before RAM and BCP.  I also hoped that it might help with atrophic scarring.  I thought Taz would be a walk in the park for me since my skin was used to RAM.  I was so wrong.  I flaked_ and broke out like crazy.  In the end it was worth it.  About three months in to treatment my skin was almost completely clear.  Over a year later I am still using Taz every other day or so.  It's great for acne_ but did little if nothing for my scars.  My pores are clearer and my skin is smoother looking.  I would recommend this product.  P.S. I have SUPER oily skin_ or should I say had.  I have started using Dr. Hauschka's normalizing day oil and my skin is now nearly normal.  It used to take 3-4 J&J oil blotters to soak up the oil.  Now I don't even fill up one!

My dermatologist gave me Tazorac_NeoBenz Micro_ and an antibiotic.

I used to have it mostly on my right cheek_ but now it's everywhere. I have a question though.  Am I suppose to be using something to clear the grease off my face?

I read all the testimonials on this site and was a little concerned about some of the side effects experience by others who used the medication.  I did experience peeling and redness like everyone else.  However this has gone away in time.  I was instructed to apply it every other night before bed.  I was also prescribed Biafine cream to use on the nights I was not applying Tazorac.  I would highly recommend alternating them.  The Biafine cream helps the skin ""heal"" more quickly.  Also be sure only to use a pea size amount of Tazorac!!  For the first few weeks I was using way too much_ thinking that more was better.  Not so.  I've only been on the medication for about two months and I already see a tremendous difference.  The first few weeks can really test your confidence and hope.  Stick with it_ it will get better.

At first the acne worsened for a couple of weeks but my pores began to shrink and the overall apearance is just better. At night I use a dab of Taz mixed with a dab of cetephil lotion and that helps avoid dryness. I wash with cetephil anti-bacterial soap not the facial cleanser because that makes my skin irritated.

DONT OVER DO IT only put a small amount on so you wont get red skin or dryness. Using a acne moisterizer is a great thing to put on the mornig after.

I would recommend this product to anyone with any acne just a lower percentage depending on the severity of your acne. Make sure you use a good moisturizer right before putting on the cream and your face should not become very dry or flaky whatsoever. Also make sure you used it EVERY night for ALL 12 weeks and be patient and it should work extremely well.

Lately it has gotten a little worse but still nothing compared to before. I think my skin has become used to it and so it has stopped working a little so im trying a new product to see if i can switch off with the tazorac and the new product. hopefully it works! by the way I have been using 0.5% tazorac. and im going to try a product i found online called clear pores.        All and all tazorac was definitely worth the time and money and i recommend it to anyone who has patience. Good Luck :),F,15,7  months,6/6/2007Email,Tazorac
197, 3, mild to moderate acne,dryness_ alot of peeling in the first week. Peeling has now subsided along with use of non-comedogenic moisturizer (very important to use moisturizer to fight the dry/peeling_ the Doc failed to mention that!),I have been using Tazorac 0.05% cream. I am just beginning my second week and seem to be goin through the breakout phase_ which seems to be the norm according to many other posts I have seen. I am wondering around what time period most people begin to see an improvement?,M,19,9  days,5/31/2007,Tazorac
198, 4, acne,Hello Im a black male and I started getting acne at the age 16 which was very mild and my Doctor put me on Defferin gel and it worked great tell I turned like 20 years old then after that my acne got real bad and my doctor put me on Tazorac gel and my whole face got all red and bumpy and itchy with alot of white heads. then it cleared up and my face was clear and my skin tone was great and it cleared my black spots i been on tazorac 0.1% gel for 2 years now But now my skin is back getting real bumpy and red and itchy.. is there anybody that knoes about any new medicine that works? or do i need a high dose,watch out for the side effects... i had burning_ stinging. bleeding and cuting my skin,M,22,2  years,5/29/2007Email,Tazorac
199, 3, Acne,Extreme skin sensitivity_ peeling_ and redness.,Tazorac is a double-edged sword. There's really not much more to it than that. Out of all the creams I have tried_ it has the most unbelievable effects. Before I discontinued it_ my skin looked extremely fair in complexion and flawless.The problem is_ Tazorac really wears down your skin strength. I guess it's worse for me because I'm on the tennis team_ so I was out in the sun about 2 hours a day. I ended up with amazing_ clear skin_ but every time I laughed_ my face turned red as a tomato. If I was embarrassed_ the same thing happened.My dermatologist switched me to Differin because it's basically a similar therapy but at a way less powerful concentration. It's Adapelene instead of Tazarotene though.For those of you who are willing to have perfect skin at the cost of turning extremely red and being embarrassed in public_ don't say you weren't warned! If you want to try a safer route_ try a weaker med like Retin-A or Differin.,M,18,18  months,5/26/2007,Tazorac
200, 5, Adult Acne,I am a 40 year of African American female_ and I have dealt with acne most of my young adult and adult life.  This is important for me to mention because black skin is different then white skin and some ways_ and I want blacks who read this testimonial to know that this product does work on black skin. The side effect that I experienced was that my skin peeled and as I understand_ this is a natural occurrence in the use of this product_ which is great because it's peeling off the old to reveal a newer and fresher skin tone. You will experience a little bit of irritation when applying make up and sunscreen_ but nothing that's unbearable.  I have not had a pimple or broken out in several months now.   The dark marks and scaring that occur after a breakout are gone. This product is fantastic!,I did continue to break-out after I started using the cream_ but I remembered reading that you should continue and that you would see results_ and so I did.,F,42,4  months,5/25/2007,Tazorac
201, 5, Sick of laim over the counter stuff,I used to get alot of peeling/redness. I use the moisturinging stuff from an old Proactive kit now_ and my skin has gotten LOADS better. Tazarac's website has a video on the steps necisarry_ and one of them is to use a moisturizer regularly. My doctor kinda forgot to tell me that. Use the moisturizer_ use tazorac_ it rocks.,You owe it to yourself to try this stuff_ if your sick of crap on infomercials_ go for it.,M,18,2  years,5/18/2007Email,Tazorac
202, 3, Acne,slight pain_ peeling,Been using tazorac for about 1 1/2 month now. The only significant difference i see is a complexion change and less blackheads. I feel like I'm still going through the phase where your face will look like its getting worse though. Acne breakouts will come and go but most time when they do come they are red and sometimes painful. I wash with 10% benzoyl perioxide in morning and at night wash with cetaphil then wait 20 min. then apply tazorac. Unfortunately I wasn't given any antibotics or anything to help with breakouts and redness_ if anybody has any tips_ advice (face washes_ moisturizers_ etc._ personal success) how to help out along the way it would be much appreciated.

203, 5, Adult acne,Slight peeling,My skin was horrile_ I had bumps everywhere.  I started Tazorac back in February.  After 2 weeks_ I noticed that my skin was starting to change.  3 months later and my skin is fantastic! I love it.  I had almost no side effects_ my skin is so oily so I never got really dry skin or never peeled.  I love it and definitely reccommend it.  I use a moisturizer by Peter Thomas Roth in the mornings which is great - it's not too heavy at all.,F,29,3  months,5/17/2007,Tazorac
204, 4, Minor Acne,Dryness,I am a fair skinned female with minor acne for 25 years. I have basically tried all acne medication to prevent breakouts. My friend gave me some free samples which lasts bout a month. I am still using these samples and I am seeing a significant difference in my skin. Even though this does cause dryness_ like any acne medication_ my skin is clear. I use this medication every other day and on the days I do not use it I remove my makeup with Ponds makeup remover and apply Oil of Olay (oil free for both products). Once a week I use a exfoliator (St.Ives Apricot Scrub) to remove the dead cells.,F,27,2  weeks,5/10/2007,Tazorac
205, 5, acne,some dryness; nothing a moisturizer won't fix,The key to this drug is patience.  Look at this forum and notice what everybody has to say about it who have been using it from 6 to 8 months +.  My dermatologist told me it would take anywhere from 6 to 8 weeks to start seeing results.  The acne normally does get worse before it gets better_ but my derm put me on an oral antibiotic (doxycycline) and a topical antibiotic (evoclin foam) to curb the intial breakout...it worked fairly well.  Now I use the Evoclin twice a day (morning_ and night) and Tazorac every night.  Use a lotion on the face (water based) and you'll cut down on the dryness (which minimizes over time).  I'm telling you_ if you have patience_ this stuff is a wonder-drug.,M,28,1.5  years,5/4/2007,Tazorac
206, 4, Adult Acne,Peeling_and alot of burning in the beginning; but the results now are remarkable! Don't second guess it_ JUST USE IT!!!,PLEASE!PLEASE!PLEASE! Give it a try it really works_ I tried just about everything there is to try for acne..and this stuff really works. I use a facial cleaning cloth called PRASCION_an oral atibiotic called SOLODYN_and TAZORAC of course.My skin in very oily around the t-zone area it certainly dried up this area alot_which was another concern of mine.The only thing I do not like about this product is..the old acne spots have yet to fade. My Dermatologist said this will take about 1 yr. to see these fade but overall NO NEW ACNE!!! AT ALL. Imagine that for a person whose been suffering with acne since I was 13yrs. old. So if anyone has any questions about this product I'm sure I could probably help..After all I feel like I'm well ahead of the game....Feel free to give me some feed back I'm more than happy to give my advice.,F,28,3  months,5/4/2007Email,Tazorac

212, 5, Acne & sun damage,Redness_ burning_ scaly skin_ initial breakouts,I have had varying degrees of acne over the years & developed painful_ cystic hormonal acne on my chin.  I have tried the a_b_c's of all treatments including antibiotics & now hormone therapy.  Have been on Tazorac (used nightly) & Benzaclyn (morning) since November & my skin is now clear. I also just finished a series of 3 chemical peels and take a very low dose of Spironolactone.  I find that my skin does get very dry with the Tazorac_ though_ and use of Cetaphil moisturizer_ while it helps_ leaves my skin greasy.  Can anyone recommend an OTC moisturizer they use?  Use of Tazorac takes a lot of patience but I must say it has worked - both for acne & skin tone.  The results took about 4 months for me.  The redness & irritation & most scaliness is now gone - along with the acne.  I just need to manage the dryness.,F,41,6  months,4/27/2007,Tazorac
213, 4, to even out sun-damaged/ageing skin,Terrible redness_ stinging_ darkening of facial skin for first couple of months,I used this cream for a few months and was disheartened as my face was permanently darker than the rest of me (!) and my skin appeared to be developing a bumpy texture that I wasn't happy with. Skin felt sensitive and 'naked'. I decided to take a break for 5 days (which helped) and start again. Only this time being VERY careful to follow the advice given on this web-site ie_ wash with a mild soapless cleanser_ then apply a water-based moisturiser. Then_ and this is very important_ wait at least 20-30 minutes before applying the Tazorac. This has made all the difference to how my skin looks and feels. Strangely_ it's peeling more_ but doesn't feel damaged or burnt and the skin being revealed underneath is much fresher and smoother than before! Good luck!,F,40,3  days,4/24/2007,Tazorac

I used tazorac at night with something called klaron and i will NEVER EVER touch it again. It ruined my face and left these bumps/scars which I never had.

I then used less of it and got to the point when i thought I no longer needed it. I WAS WRONG. I realized my skig wasnt as great anymore and started using tazorac 4 weeks ago. and i dont remember breaking out this much last time I used it.

222, 4, acne in the t-zone,IRRITATION_ flaking_ redness,First of all_ this thing is expensive.  Like everyone else says_ the beginning is pretty brutal.  I'm in highschool and i felt like i had a huge sign above me that said...look at the freak.  but it gets better.  i've been using it for the last month and a half and i feel a lot more comfortable with my skin_ deffinitely not comfortable enough to stop wearing concealer all over my forhead but i'm getting there.  I still have acne scars_ and red spots.  i think  make it worst because when it flakes_ i'll pick.  i'll try to remove ALL the flaking which sometimes takes some skin not ready to go along with it.  DON'T DO IT.  old habits die hard for me :-i can see a clear-acne free road ahead.oh btw i'm asian (our skin is known to be easily scarred) and i notice some scarring beginning to fade.  but i'm only 16_ my dermatologist informs that the scars should fade within the next year after i get my acne in control.,F,16,5  weeks,4/14/2007,Tazorac

I read a few studies on Tazorac and found out a few things you should know about this drug that I'll bet your dermatologist didn't tell you. First off_ Tazorac cleared my skin of acne_ completely_ but left behind a bumpy texture that I was not willing to live with. So_ I tried out most of the drugs aforementioned for maybe 8 months of experimentation_ and found nothing worked as well as fast. I then learned some interesting things. Tazorac has a method of application other products don't. First you wash your face with a MILD soap. (I recommend Cetaphil.) Then you put on a water based face lotion. (I HIGHLY recommend Mimyx. It is probably the best lotion ever created.) You then wait 20 minutes for the upper layer of the dermis to repair itself. (This is VERY IMPORTANT.) Then_ you put on the Tazorac.

230, 2, Acne flare-up,I took Retin-A as a teenager_ but ultimately Accutane is what cleared my skin up for 10 years! After having a baby two years ago_ my hormonal changes led to increasing flare-ups in my acne - especially on my face and back. Unfortunately_ Tazorac has only: 1) caused more acne on my face - even in places where there was none before; 2) caused almost unbearable dryness and peeling; 3) contributed to severe scarring; and 4) contributed to extreme discoloration and unevenness of my skin tone - something I've never experienced before! The only positive thing is that my skin is very smooth - even if there is some severe scarring instead of acne. Ugh.

You hardly experience anything. However it has been 4 weeks now and I still have some acne_ granted there are some improvements but I think I have to wait a couple of weeks to see the real results.

Last year my skin became so bad that I refused to stay over friends houses or let my roommate or family members see my face after I washed off my make-up (even though the make-up didn't make my skin look much better). My dermatologist finally prescribed me Tazorac and Doxycycline (anti-biotic) and this combination has helped my skin tremendously. My dermatologist said that most patients' skin is too sensitive to take tazorac. There was mild peeling and itching for the first couple of weeks but afterwards... my skin only keeps getting better.

239, 5, Acne and scars,dryness_ itching_ burning_ peeling_ redness,Yes I did peel and itch and burn when I started using tazorac but that is just feew weeks until your skin gets used on it. This is normal process and using good oil free moisturizer that u can apply several times a day helps. I got a great lotion for hydration with hearbs_ vitamins and all protection and that subsided the irritations and redness. I also was on antibiotic first but stoped using it cause it made my stomac upset. Tazorac does help with acne_ scars and uneven skin tone. It bleaches the skin so all of my freckles are gone now.

I'll stick it out a little longer but I'm losing hope. Maybe it's because of my age it's taking longer??,F,43,7  weeks,2/3/2007,Tazorac
243, 5, Improve acne,Redness and sensitivity for the first few months that I was on it.,I didn't get a pimple until I was 18 - but once they started popping up_ they didn't stop! I tried literally everything - RetinA_ the pill_ all over the counter brands_ Proactiv_ etc. Some things would help at first_ but after awhile it seemed like my skin got 'immune' to the medicine_ and my breakouts would pick up again. My dermatologist prescribed Tazorac and my skin has been better ever since. I've been using it for 2 years and will use it forever! Tazorac in conjunction with doxicycline (an anti-inflammatory antibiotic) has made my skin perfect. I NEVER thought I'd have perfect skin again - this product is the miracle I was looking for.,F,24,2  years,1/17/2007,Tazorac

I was on .05% for 6 weeks and when I saw nothing dramatic I started with .1%. It's been a week now and I still see little of anything. It decreased the acne on my forehead_ but hasn't done much to help scars or wrinkles. I don't break out anymore_ so I have been smothering lots of moisturizers on with little worries of getting a breakout. That is nice. But I would like to see texture improvement (which is my MAIN goal_ I HATE the shallow acne scars).,F,34,2  months,1/9/2007,Tazorac

246, 5, Moderate Acne,Haven't tried it yet.,"I'm really excited about trying this product (I just got it today). But the thing that makes me kind of worried is that my dermatologist told me to use TAZORAC as a mask every night (leave it on for 10 minutes_ then wash it off). Everyone here seems to be applying it as a cream...I just feel like it's a waste. I'm also on some sort of antibacterial cream and antibiotics. I used to have very little acne_ and now it seems to be getting worst_ it's so stressful. But_ finals are almost over and there's a 3 week holiday. I'll start this week_ and in total_ 4 weeks of TAZORAC. In those 4 weeks Im expecting to see the ""bad"" side first_ and when I come back to school_ I HOPE it'll start improving. I'm really hoping this combo of medication will help. I've been on Tetracycline twice and Minocycline recently and tried a buncha topical creams and nothing really worked.

I have oily skin to begin with so I dont think I am as dry and flaky as some of the others that have posted ratings. I must say that my skin_ even after 3 weeks is 95% better. The texture is much softer_ my scars have already begun to fade_ fine lines around my eyes are fading and people are taking notice. I am also on an oral antibiotic_ not sure what it is_ but I think this oral antibiotic has helped me not get worse acne after intial use like many posters have said they get. I would definatly recomend this.,M,29,22  days,12/5/2006,Tazorac
248, 5, Mild/Moderate Acne,Peeling/flaking (almost like after a sunburn)_ burning/itching_ acne got worse in first four weeks_ but then subsided.,I want to use it for the rest of my life!  I'm serious.  I have had mild/mod chronic acne since HS.  I used all the washes and over the counter medications_ but when it seemed like only scars were left_ I would have another breakout.  If I popped the pimples_ they would usually scab over and heal quickly_ but if I couldn't/didn't pop one_ it would stay there for weeks.  I hated going in public b/c of my face.  Now pimples are rare_ my scars are clearing_ and I have hardly any blackheads.  YES my acne got worse at first_ BUT: my doctor gave me a topical antibiotic (specifically Clindamycin) to use with Tazorac.  I'm pretty sure that helped a bunch_ b/c the pimples in the first 4 weeks of Tazorac went away really quickly (it could also have just been the Tazorac_ I don't know_ but I'm thinking the antibiotic killed whatever Tazorac was bringing to the surface).  Acne was causing me social anxiety and in turn_ depression_ but now I'm so much happier.  I really really recommend it.  I thin,M,24,7  weeks,12/2/2006,Tazorac
249, 5, mild acne,sensitive skin_ a ton of peeling everywhere (it's scary at first_ but gradually gets better)_ burning,I love TAZORAC! I've been using it for 4 months now and my face is absolutely flawless_ no foundation necessary flawless. People often tell me that I glow_ it's amazing. I did have to switch to a heavier moisturizer since use (Kiehl's 30 SPF rocks)_ but who needs money now when you have a beautiful face? After my year abroad_ Differin and the topical acne cream that I used stopped working and it was awful. I went back to my dermatologist and he prescribed Tazorac. The first month or so the skin looked so much worse_ but all the comments were encouraging me to give it a few months. The cause of my acne is pretty much stress from college_ and now even with the stress_ TAZORAC is working. I use it every other night if my skin is extra sensitive that day (especially NYC winters which are rough). I'm just extremely happy.,F,22,4  months,11/24/2006,Tazorac
250, 5, Acne,redness _ Peeling_ be careful not to scratch or injure facial skin in any way while using Tazorac_ you will get horrible sores from this as a layer will come right off. So no peels or waxing of any kind or you will be sorry. I LOVE THIS STUFF well worth the side affects. I have had mild/ moderate acne for over 20 years_ after 1 1/2 year on Tazorac_ nothing_ except a red face_ but let me tell you I dont mind that at all. I use Tazorac at night_ a pea sized amount and if I ever do get a zit I dab a little extra on it_ and in 2 or 3 days POOF gone_ but whatever you do NEVER pick a zit i you are using Tazorac. I use colorless/ odorless/ alcohol free aloe  vera for moisturizing in the morning and St. Ives medicated scrub in the morning and at night_ DO NOT SCRUB WITH IT_ just a real light once over removes any dead skin. I am on jasmin_ and 100 mg of Spiranolactone_ but it was definitely the TAZORAC that made a difference for me _ I use the 0.5% gel.,BE PATIENT IT WILL WORK< HONEST IT WILL_ if your face looks horrible it WILL help. Dont give up. If you are really red and you cant take the tazorac_ then chances are you are using to much of it.

I had been on Accutane 3 times before back in high school and college(dramtic results but it came back) so my doctor was afraid to let me try it any more.  I used Tazorac for 2 weeks and it burned and peeled so badly I gave up and stopped.  Then I tried a month later by dabbing only on the acne spots at night before bed and not the rest of my face and it made it more tolerable.  I did not see much improvement at all for 1 month but kept at it.  It's now been 2 continuous months and I'm starting to see improvements.  My skin is clearer and the acne pigmentation is slowly lightening; the peeling is still there but very mild.  I use Proactive cleanser and sunscreen and my doctor also put me on a combo of doxycycline and Yasmin birth control which I think also helped.  This medication is effective but takes at least 2 months and lots of patience to kick in.,F,25,2  days,10/11/2006,Tazorac

Many people are discouraged when the tazorac makes acne appear to be worse.  But the acne getting worse is all part of the process.  This happens because all the junk under your skin is brought to the surface while using tazorac.  It not only will get rid of what is already on the surface_ but it will also clean out whats under the skin.  My derm said it would take about 4-6 weeks to see improvement and/or optimal clearing.  Now at week 3_ i have already experienced the worsening of my acne.  I am now at the point where my acne should start to get better and eventually clear up.

The burning_ flakiness_ & dryness goes away for me after 3 days. I use ProActiv also so the beads in the wash help to wash away the dead skin. Underneath it looks good after a couple days of healing and cutting down on Tazorac. My dermatologist feels it's the best source to get rid of my acne and is hesitant to put me on Accutane due to severe side effects.

Kinda pricey_ but definitely worth every cent. I am on Dynacin or Minocycline and I have people off the street commenting on my creamy complexion. Don't give up! Everyone deserves a healthy complexion.,F,28,2  months,10/13/2005Email,Tazorac

294, 5, acne,flaking_ dryness around the mouth,At first my skin was all blotchy and much darker than normal. The first 2 weeks were brutal because even though the DR warned me it would dry me out at first_ I didn't expect that level of peeling. The good thing is I haven't had acne since that flaking ended. I saw a friend I haven't seen in months and her jaw dropped. My skin is totally flawless. Stick with it please and don't lose hope. You'll be glad you did. This product is a godsend!,F,31,4  months,10/3/2005,Tazorac
295, 1, Acne,I used it for 3 days_ and my skin is burning_ red_ peeling_ flaking_ some areas are scabbing_ tight_ dry. This is like a chemical peel. 3 days and still healing.. How long before this heals? Might have to go for an operation..,,M,19,3  days,9/27/2005,Tazorac
296, 4, acne,reddish skin if left on too long_ worsening of acne at 2 week point(expected)before the healing started,I was told to apply it for 1 hour a day for the first 2 weeks so skin would adjust.  Since then I wear at night while doing homework_ a few nights a week leave it on all night. Also using Duac and 2% Salicylic acid face wash_ Doxycycline 100mg 2X day.  A definite improvement so far.,M,17,2  months,9/12/2005,Tazorac
297, 3, ADULT ACNE,been using it for over a month_ at first dry skin but not that bad.,i was using it with erythromycin benzoyl peroxide gel and got very flakey. then i decided to only use tazorac which definiely improved the skin texture but NOT  the acne_ or maybe slightly helped. at one point i had 20 not so small pimples on my face-never had that in my life. some painful ones too. tazorac makes my skin SO OILY that i keep on breaking out because of oiliness. i took a 4 day break from it and my pimples are going away and did not get a new one yet which has not happened since i started using tazorac (when i got 1-3 new pimples every 1-2 days and cysts)im going to ween off it and see what happens. i will start using it for improving skin texture in a week or so.,F,27,7  weeks,8/15/2005,Tazorac
298, 5, acne,Dry skin_ but that can be controlled by daily exfoliation_ and putting vaseline on top of the tazorac cream at night.  I wait about 10 minutes or so after applying tazorac.,Also taking Diane 35_ and sulfatrim (antibiotic).  My skin is glowing.  No new acne since about month 4_ and I was on accutane before this drug combination_ so I did have very bad acne.  Also seeing naturopath for same amount of time and have been avoiding dairy products_ so my success may be a combination of these factors.  My skin justs keep looking better and better!,F,24,6  months,8/12/2005,Tazorac
299, 2, medium acne..,pinkness in skin_ dry_ peelings_ tight_ kinda stingy,I mean I have only used it twice and it is making me peel_ thankgod its summer or i would be so embarrassed at school_ but i am praying it will work_  my doc told me it gets worse before it begins to get better_ it takes 4 weeks_ so for all you hopeless people using it for a couple weeks give it time..but when you first start it_ use it every other night..and PLEASE wait 20 min after washing face...OR your skin gets irritated..trust me..hah..anyways but i am hopeful it will help me..plus my skin is very smooth..so thats a pro..hah.but i dunno good luck everyone else!!,F,16,2  days,7/6/2005,Tazorac

302, 5, acne_ +sun-damage skin,stinging/burning soon after applying_ dryness_ flaking/peeling_ skin tightness,I had severe flaking for about 1-2 weeks_ so much I was embarrassed to go out in public_ but the more I used it_ the less of a problem it became.  Now_ it's a minor problem only in the dry winter months.  I use a moisterizer several times a day and it works.  I don't have flaking anymore.

304, 3, moderate acne,Tazorac made my skin really oily. It peeled off my top layer of skin leaving it red.,It's hard to stick with Tazorac when you have a busy_ social schedule. I am a full time college student so of course_ I don't get a lot of alone time. I put tazorac on at night but my results don't seem to be any better in the morning. I have hope though. I went off it for a while but after reading other peoples' reviews I'm going to stick with it and try again :),F,20, ,2/19/2005,Tazorac

308, 4, acne,skin got very dry when I started using it. important to start off using it for a short period of time every other night and working your way up to using it all night every night.,I think this product has been the best I have tried. Have used many other prescriptions and Proactiv. This product made my pores appear alot smaller and helped fade scars. Still get some pimples but much better,F,25,6  months,1/30/2005,Tazorac

310, 4, acne,Redness_ peeling,I've found this cream to work very well for my adult acne.  I still have breakouts but the cream takes care of them in a flash.
