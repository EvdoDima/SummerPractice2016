1, 1, osteoporosis,severe leg pain; severe back & joint pain,I had to be taken by ambulance from work to the hospital because pain got so severe I could no longer sit or stand. This medicine is poison and the doctor who prescribed it to me is responsible for giving me poison. It's been almost 2 months since I took one dose and still in pain and having problems walking.  I pray these side effects go away.,F,51,1  months150 mg,7/21/2016Email,Boniva
2, 1, Osteopenia,Boniva gave me ulcers.,I am very healthy and active.  Three months after taking Boniva_ I had violent gastric episodes.  Heartburn_ bloating_ belching and some bowel problems. After many doctor appointments_ I realized I had the symptoms synonymous with ulcers. After research_ I discovered that many people have reported ulcers from the use of bishosphonates. I have no doubt that my health problem started with Boniva.  I quit the stuff immediately_ and am currently on a healing diet that I hope will help.  The symptoms I developed changed my daily life.  I agree with others_ this stuff is poison.  Also_ this is the first time I've ever contributed a review to ANY website.  I decided to do it because I appreciate learning about other's experiences with drugs.  I wanted to help warn others about the dangers of Boniva.  There are other remedies for bone loss that are being researched_ and I intend to find out more.  I'm also looking into diet options_ and a product called AlgaeCal_ a high absorption calcium.  If anyone has other options_ please post.  Good luck to everyone!,F,58,3  months 1X M,7/12/2016,Boniva
3, 1, Osteoporosis,Only a few day after starting Boniva I started getting burning aches and pains in my arms_ shoulders elbow. It felt like it was deep in my bones. Now  I'm having problems with both of my shoulders. I can't lift my arms up over my head to comb my hair. After the first two doses I called my dr to inform her how I was feeling. She said take it for one more month and see if the side effects go away. They only got worse. I then called to tell her I wasn't taking it anymore. I explained how I was feeling and she said I needed to go to an orthopedic dr because the sides affect were not caused from the Boniva. And in fact she said it sounds like I have arteritis. I was never told I had arteritis before I started the Boniva This is a horrible drug. It needs to be taken off the market asap. I would not recommend to anyone.

8, 1, Decrease in bone density,Have been on Miacalcin for many years. Dr. Said bone density had gone down and prescribed Boniva. I put him off for 6 months then he convinced me to take it. As instructed I took pill with about 10 oz of water at 7:30 in the morning. Did not sit or lie down until several hours later. By 7:00 pm I was in pain. Legs neck shoulders. I felt like every bone and muscle in my body was hurting. Slept none At all that night due to pain. Could barely walk the next day. My right hand and wrist was useless. Could not use it at all. Low grade fever later that day and night. 20 days into. The month I had red blisters on my neck and face. Then scaled off like a sunburn. Month finally over. Still skin problems but joint pains are almost gone. Hopefully the skin problems will evidentially go away also. Have an appointment with a rheumatologist next week. Unless my T scores are off the chart I will not take any more of these types of drugs. Back to my Miacalcin. Never had a broken bone in my life. Another 20 years of nothing cannot be as bad as one month of Boniva.,,F,69,1  months150 mg,3/1/2016,Boniva

22, 1, Osteoporsis,Within 1 hour I had piercing head pain which increased with movement. Took my blood pressure and it was 152/103. At my physician's office 9 days earlier it was 118/78. I am an athlete who does triathlons and in training for my first ironman. I immediately went to the doctor and she had to put me on blood pressure medication. Day 2 wasn't much better. Day 3 was fairly good with the blood pressure under control and minor headache. Continued with my training for the ironman which is on September 27. Day 4 woke up with the severe headache and my diastolic pressure (the lower number over 100). The jabbing head pain nearly caused a fall. By 4pm I started with excruciating stomach pain.

I went back to the doctor because of pain in my left leg (had a previous right femur fracture with IM rod insertion). I am scheduled for surgery to put a rod in my left leg due to atypical femur fracture. This poison works by preventing loss of bone. But it doesn't allow new bone to form so all that's left is old bone which is brittle. I refused my last DEXA scan because_ frankly_ I don't care what the numbers are. I am a) not going to change what I am doing now (supplements and diet) and b) the scan measures quantity and not quality of bone and so is misleading.

54, 1, I broke a rib,The first time I took this once a month pill it nearly killed me. I began throwing up liters of blood and passing it through my rectum for hours before a friend found me.  I was in ICU for 14 days total.  The massive bleeding continued for ten days durning which I received 17 transfusion's  of my rare blood type to keep me alive. Throughout those ten days I was not allowed to eat any food what so ever while they  made several attempts to locate and cauterize the many deep holes this drug had eaten into the lining of my duodenal area within only  seven days following my taking it.  On the 10th day in ICU they made a last ditch effort to save my life by operating on me. They opened me up to sew close the deep holes  Boniva created.  After 14 days in ICU_ and another five elsewhere_ I was placed in a nursing home for 28 days to recover.  Within the first five days of being there I suffered a stroke for which Dr. Athos refused to listen to my daughter's pleas to come and see me immediately,This drug has a black box warning which says do not give to patients with GERD. My doctor gave me a free trial dosage which was one pill per month even though he had been treating my GERD for four years prior. The only bone related issues I had were Arthritis in one knee and in the knuckles of both hands.  For that pain I had received two localized Cortisone Injections twice a year for two years before I fell out of my bed and  broke a rib at age 78.,F,78,1  monthsunknown 1X M,4/17/2014,Boniva

99, 3, ,,I am posting this note because I have had some success remedying the long term joint pain problems many of you discussed. Although I was taking Fosamax rather than Boniva_ they are both bisphosphonates and are very similar in action and side effects_ and I thought my success might be very helpful to some of you.  After taking Fosamax for 7 years with no problems_ I took a single generic pill in October_ 2011. In a few hours I had nearly all the side effects listed in the other postings_ hip pain_ shoulder pain_ jaw pain_ popping joints_ soreness on balls of feet. I had been completely pain free before this. I stopped the Fosamax immediately and most of the symptoms subsided over a couple of months. However_ the posterior hip continued to hurt with every step_ and the shoulder pain continued. For ten months there was no improvement. Besides Fosamax_ I had also been taking Lipitor for five years. Since Lipitor is known to cause muscle/joint pain_ and since Lipitor affects the same cellular metabolic mevalonate pathway as does Fosamax_ I thought I would try discontinuing Lipitor for a while. While not completely gone_ the hip and the shoulder improved significantly within weeks. Do approach this cautiously_ since you must be on Lipitor for some cardiovascular reason_ and your cardiovascular benefits of Lipitor must be weighed in.,F,65,  1X D,10/15/2012,Boniva

103, 1, Osteoporosis,Burning mouth and loose teeth; hair loss; muscle pain all over my body; debilitating fatigue. I wonder if anyone else has lost libido?,The symptoms came on slowly and it wasn't until my mouth started burning and my teeth got loose that I began to wonder what was wrong. I'd had a hip replacement and attributed the pain in my legs to that. But my arms and neck also hurt and my hair was falling out. I also had indigestion and fatigue. i would come home from work and lie down and my husband would have to wake me for supper. Then I would be in bed asleep by eight. Also_ my thiking was (is) fuzzy_ and my eyesight has deteriorated. I'm 69 and my 83-year-old sister-in-law can run rings around me. I hope this goes away.

104, 1, bone loss,I am convinced it gave me a heart attack!  I had like hives in my esophagus and such an indigestion like I had never had before!  I took three days off from work!  Later found that I had had a heart attack & do believe it was that day!  I had never had indigestion like that in my life!  This occurred in 2007_ before there was all this information on how lethal Boniva is!!!  When I failed my heart tests with my cardiologist_ I immediately told him about my experience with Boniva.  I also told my primary care physician and he just got up and walked out of the room like I was nuts or not to be believed.  Now_ that I read all of these comments_ I finally feel some support for what I experienced.  I will NEVER take another one of these pills!  I would rather be alive than have strong bones!!!,I hope they take this pill off of the market!

This isn't my first go around with Boniva-I took is successfully-or so I thought from 2008-2010.  No known side effects and my bone density improved. I had some medical problems at the end of 2010 and most of 2011 where I stopped taking it.  Had gall bladder surgery in April 2011 and after that couldn't tolerate the boniva anymore because of severe heart burn-my Dr. wanted to do the infusion-but thankfully insurance wouldn't cover it. Stupidly tried Fosamax for a month-that was horrible.  Since I already have osteoporosis and due to other high risk factors_ I agreed to try the oral Boniva again--its only been a week and its been absolutely horrible.  I thought since I didn't get the excruciating heartburn it would be ok--wrong!!!  Every muscle_ joint_ bone in body hurts.

112, 1, Osteoporosis,Three years ago I was diagnosed with Osteoporosis.  At first I was on Actonel.  That was HORRIBLE. The doctor put me on Boniva.  The side effects of Boniva are not as bad as the Actonel_ but almost as bad.   I have been on Boniva two years now waiting for the side effects to subside as the doctor told me. I feel that it is supposed to help me not hurt me.  The first two days of the month I am constantly falling asleep sitting or standing because I am so fatigued by it.  I have fallen out of chairs I am so sleepy.  Days two thru five of each month I have what feels like PAIN INSIDE MY LEG BONES..  After first 4-5 days the sleepiness and bone pain goes away until the next month I take it.  After two years on Boniva he did a bone density scan.   The doctor told me the Osteoporosis has not gotten any worse_ but has not gotten any better either.  The Boniva does not appear seem to be doing anything. The side effects are not worth it either.

I started taking Boniva 5 months ago. As the months passed_ I began with one symptom_ then another. At first_ you don't think about a side-effect of medication. This is a very sly_ ugly medication...it invades your body and creeps up on you....like a bad storm. During these past five months I kept wondering what was going on with me...what was wrong...I felt terrible...seemed like one thing and another...having to call off sick from my job.

What a horrible drug_ I feel much worse then when I didn't take anything. I was a little skeptical to begin with and now even more nervous about continuing it. I started taking more calcium with Vitamin D hoping it helps. My next step if this doesn't work is trying a Holistic Practitioner. I think doctors today don't care as much for their patients and I find that they just hand you a prescription without really advising you of alternatives.

Antacids no longer working. I love milk and it was tasting awful - took several back to the grocery store and told them it was spoiled. Chest pains getting worse and having hot flashes again so blaming it on side effects of arthritis meds. Still no clue.

Suddenly one day at dinner_ it felt like I was choking_ with the strong sensation of food stuck in my throat.  It was very frightening.  After many tests: ENT/endoscopy_ MRI of throat_ barium swallow tests_ it was diagnosed as ""globus sensation"" (sensation of a lump in the throat) but the cause wasn't identified.  I couldn't eat solid food for 2 months.  I started eating again but the globus sensation remained and after 5 months even got worse.  None of the doctors pointed to Boniva as a possible cause.  I started ""connecting the dots"" after speaking with a couple of pharmacists as well as Boniva_ and learned that taking Boniva can change the cells in your esophagus.  While there are no direct links_ there was enough information that indicated to me that Boniva MIGHT be the cause.  After consultation with my doctor_ I decided to stop taking Boniva.  After 30 days I noticed a small improvement for the first time.  After 60 days I noticed a real improvement.  Now_ after 90 days the ""globus sensation"" is entirely gone.  [Note: for several years prior to taking Boniva I was treated for mild acid reflux of the larynx (causing a mild sore throat all the time).]  It seems clear to me that Boniva was the cause of a severe globus sensation.",F,59,2  years150MG 1X M,12/30/2011Email,Boniva

184, 1, Osteopenia,I had been taking Actonel monthly with just a few days of stomach upset.  My insurance plan changed and would not pay for Atonel and said they would pay for part of the Boniva. The diarrhea began within hours after I took my first 1 monthly dose of Boniva on July 30thOn August 22_ after no relief with Imodium or Pepto  and still having diarrhea every day_ I saw my doctor hoping he had some medication to stop this.  I think he was dubious about the Boniva being the culprit so he ran blood tests and had me give him stool samples.  While waiting for the results (both were negative)_ he put me on Lomotil to slow my bowel and Noroxin an antibiotic. The Lomotil did not work. Needless to say_ I am 8 pounds lighter due enduring 36 days of diarrhea.  I am wearing pads_ because I dont always make it to the bathroom.  Rather debilitating and humiliating at work and when it happens in the grocery store.  Plus trying to work with lower tract cramps that make you double over.,I also remembered something I heard a long time ago on the Peoples Pharmacy about eating Archway macaroon cookies to stop diarrhea.  So I bought some cookies and some coconut milk since the coconut oil was suppose to help.  It did not work right away_ however after 3 days of macaroons_ I am seeing some relief. The relief could also be due to the duration of the date since I took Boniva.  I WILL CONTINUE TO TELL WOMEN TO STAY AWAY FROM BONIVA!!!,F,63,1  days 1X M,9/4/2011Email,Boniva

I asked for a scan_ because I felt hip pain. I started on Fosamax because of osteopenia and also began exercising. The hip pain went away and my scan showed improvement. I was switched to Boniva because of the ability to take it only once a month. I don't remember when the leg pain started or when my hips started hurting again. I assumed it was because I was shirking on my exercise and on taking my calcium. I assumed the fatigue I started feeling last year was just aging_ stress from working_ improper diet_ etc. I am now retired at 61. The stress is gone_ I am eating well and taking supplements regularly_ and exercising. I should be feeling stronger_ but I'm not. At various times I have researched aging_ restless leg syndrome_ poor circulation_ and fibromyalgia. I finally have the time to think about and look for information_ and I was astounded to find every one of my symptoms listed on this board. I have also realized that the worst of my pain comes just after I have taken my monthly dose. (I don't know why I've never made this connection before.) After taking my pill 2 days ago I have had insomnia for 2 nights and have had extreme burning I'm my lower legs and pain in my hips.

So I waited and then had to call dr. back.  Prescribed 6 days of prednisone_ benadryl_ and double up on the Prilosec.  She didn't want to give anything for the pain.  I think she just read the insert or side effects.  I hope only six days of Prednisone helps since it is a monthly dose of the Boniva.

Then I found this website and seen everyone here having the same side effects and plus my husband also has COPD and that makes the coughing worse and his breathing so needless to say that the one and only pill that he took this past weekend will be his one and only pill going into his body ever. I just hope that these side effects go away soon and very quickly. It is just a shame that the drug company's can't put something out there that will help not cause all the effects of problems.

198, 4, Osteoporosis/Breast cancer,Mood swings_/anxiety_ general malaise and flu like symptoms. It only lasts for about 3-4 days and it doesn't prevent me from working or getting on with things.,"I am taking Boniva because I am taking a breast cancer drug which reduces bone density and I already have some osteopaenia/osteoporosis. I was taking alendronic acid once a week but swapped to Boniva once a month to reduce the number of days that I had to suffer side effects. Instead of 12 ""off"" days a month I now have 4. Cramming a month's worth of efficacy into one pill means that the pill is going to be very powerful. Side effects are inevitable.I have seen my grandmother die of a broken spine caused by osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a very BIG deal and it needs powerful drugs to fend it off. It is rebuilding bone.As a breast cancer patient I have a different perspective on all of this and and more accepting of side effects if the drug I am taking is doing what needs to be done.I would advise people not to be put off by some of the alarmist comments.

Literally every joint in my body had excruciating pain_ I was convinced that my cancer had spread to my bones. I couldn't sleep at all that night with worry. I went on my computer to see the symptoms of bone cancer. I finally placed the pain with taking the Boniva. I went to a pharmacist as soon as it opened and he assured me it was probably due to the Boniva. Unfortunately_ I had severe joint pain the remainer of my trip. When I returned home I went to my doctor and he said it was from the Boniva and not to take it again. He said it would most likely last for a month_ that was two months ago and I still have severe joint pain. I'm terrified it's permanent.

I called my doctor and told her what was happening.  She wanted me to come in_ because she thought these symptoms were from something other than the Boniva.

203, 1, severe osteoporosis T-Score -3.0,I developed costochondritis in 2006 which in itself was the most debilitating_ painful condition i have ever experienced. After numerous referrals and hospital admissions the only pain relief i had was from taking prednisalone (steroids) at doses ranging from 5mg-30mg daily and continued to for approx 3 years until Sept 2010.Despite all the side effects of these and other meds incl.anti-spasmodics_meds for nerve pain and strong analgesics incl.morphine i still experience costo pain just to a lesser degree.I repeatedly asked my Gp and consultants to refer me to have a DEXA scan to detect for osteoporosis since i had been on high doses for a long time and was concerned about severe damage to my bones-to even provide preventative medications.I was told i was only young and thus unnecessary.My own occy health dept referred me for a scan only to discover i had severe osteoporosis and commenced on Bonviva tablets for 12 months followed by an I.V infusion in 2010.I have since developed chroni,NOT to be recommended to ANYONE.

I pray to God and have faith to go back to my normal life but there is always that what if I dont  and its very depressing.  It has been 90 days since I took it and Im still in so much pain. I do feel better and I do have good days where the pain is not as bad_ but my pain varies most of the time. Im a lot better but not 100%. My feet are swollen and I walk like if I was barefoot through a path of rocks. Im constantly hiding from my family and friends to tear. I feel exhausted_  I would have thought Boniva would be out of my system by now but I guess its not. Im so frightened that I will never be back to my normal active life. Im 35 years old with a husband and 2 boys. This poisonous pill has brought sadness to my family. Please dont take this pill I heard it has helped some people but the changes are very small and the agony you will go through is not worth it.  I went through everything mentioned in these testimonies. From Flu like symptoms to severe spasm and Hospitalization. Good luck to Everyone and thank you very much for your testimonies.

I had severe shooting pain that came and went at random in my toes. My jaw moved and lower teeth began to move.  I now need braces to correct my teeth allignment which were perfect until Boniva.

240, 3, Clinical trial/normal bone mass,"I had stage 1 breast cancer 2 yrs ago. I am in a clinical trial of Boniva. Boniva has an off-label effect of preventing bone cancer in woman who had breast cancer. I also have normal bone mass (+1.7 sd above mean). I have to have a kidney panel done every 3 months to make sure the phosphate does not damage my kidneys. So far so good. I have to be on this another year. Like other women_ I experience severe bone_ joint and muscle pain in my feet_ legs and hips. I hobbled and limp for several minutes in the morning ro any time I sit for longer than 30 min. I have to stretch more and longer before going to work or exercising. Happily_ after stretching and ""walking it off""_ I am able to run long distances_ regularly. I am running 1/2 marathons and getting ready to move up to marathons. For some reason_ the pain does not equate as actual injury. So far I have had no stomach problems. I do have insomnia but that may be from the anti-hormonal I also have to take.",Being a breast cancer survivor and taking Boniva to prevent future cancer gives me a different perspective on the daily pain. I do have to stretch and warm my muscles up more often_ replace my running shoes more often but if I can still run marathon distances ans never get cancer again_ the pain I get from Boniva is worth the small amount of suffering.

My doctor said that the Bonvia side effect are more like indigestion_ diarrhea than constipation_ which is the opposite of diarrhea.I had a acupuncture treatment to improve the constipation situation_ and continued to drink warm water.No improvement still.I then checked on the internet_ and found that constipation is one of the possible side effect listed near the bottom.I bought MiraLax in case I cannot stand the bloated feeling any more.I have not yet taken it_ because I fear that if I took MiraLax_ then the Boniva medical effect will be washed away.After all_ Bonvia is such an expensive drug.,F,54,1  months150mg 1X M,1/4/2011,Boniva

I started Boniva apx. 3 years ago and didn_t have any side effects( that I recognized)at the time. At 60 years old with a lifetime of scoliosis a few back and hip aches seem normal.  About 2 years ago I realized that i was gaining weight without any change to my diet or excersize. I have ALWAYS watched my weight_ eaten very helthily and worked out. This gain was so upsetting that i went to a nutritionist_ and health counselor to see what was what. Abbout 2 years ago i started having some muscle pains in my left hip/groin area as if i had tendonitis or a pulled muscle. It wa so bad that I couldn't lay on either side for any length of time without moving around to lessen it. There were some day s better than others but it was always there. It has sinced left that side and is now in the right. If I sit for even 15 minutes perhaps in a restaurant or on the sofa i am so stiff and walk like an 80 year old arthritis patient.

This increased during the night and flulike symptoms escalated significantly_ causing insomnia. Stomach cramps and muscle aches led to work absence the following day.This has been followed by significant upper back pain that feels like muscles have seized for 4 days.,I was not prepared for the length of this significant reaction. This has been so severe and prolonged that it has spurred me to write an internet comment about a complaint for the first time. I will not take this medication again.,F,54,1  days150mg 1X M,11/5/2010,Boniva
277, 1, osteopenia,1st dose within 24 hrs. hip pain_ which subsided after another 24 hours; 2nd dose again with 24 hrs. bone pain in back_ upper chest thought it was arthritis even though never had symptoms before; 3rd dose 48 hrs. ago-woke up 24 hrs later with foot pain felt like a severe sprain_ gone next morning; however_ this afternoon lower back pain (felt like my hernia disc pain) now upper chest and even arm pain.  Each month this pain has become more severe; though it has disipated in 24 to 48 hrs.  I'm afraid of what will happen in the future if I continue.  These symptoms have to be the Boniva.  I was feeling great prior to taking Boniva.  I see my doctor in a couple of weeks and I'm stopping this drug.  So far_ I never got nauseated or had stomach pain....,After reading comments and my reactions/sypmtoms to Boniva_ I  suggest you do not take this drug.

287, 1, Not taking B though recommended,Very concerned about taking it after highly recommended by endocrinologist,After reading this website_ I am convinced that Boniva is not for me. I am a very strong advocate of taking natural products instead of drugs. My chiropractor kinesiologist discovered that my levels of estrogen were too high blocking the absorption of calcium. (after taking a test that regular doctors will not offer to you). I stopped using tofu_ honey_ plastic containers (plastic leaks estrogen from soft plastic such as bottled water - get a water filter system)_ our water and earth have an excess of estrogen now due to plastics. Birth control pill do not get absorbed in our body_ they are dumped into our waters. The levels are so high_ that men's estrogen levels have increased causing problems with low sperm counts causing inability to get pregnant. Eliminating estrogen helped my bones go from osteoporosis to osteopenia. The endocrinologist was amazed!! I am not saying that this is the answer for everyone_ but it definitely helped me. I also found that it is harmful to take herbal supplements for things such things as allergies. It messes with our immune system and shown that they cause problems with the absorption of calcium in bones.  Also get out and get some sun. We need the sun like plants do_ we need the V-D to help in absorptions of calcium. Our body was created to move. One of the most important things to do is move. Exercise!!! Get out and walk.!!!,F,60,  1X D,10/24/2010Email,Boniva

By 9am was sprawled on floor of empty office with really bad stomach pain and then went to restroom and started vomiting again. Can barely eat anything. Only get relief by drinking water.,I paid $70 for one pill. I will not take this again. My money would be better spent buying lactose free milk_ high-grade vitamin D and Citracal.

It hit again out of the blue last week but only lasted 2 days this time.  I have recently developed leg cramps at night_ also acid reflux.  It seems that when one thing goes away another appears. In December 2010 it will be 4 years since I first took this drug.  Somewhere I heard it has a 4 year half life in the bones.,I have had 3 years of hell from this drug and it is finally getting better.  I have no idea what the long lasting effects are and can honestly say that the makers and the FDA should rot for what they have done. What really scares me is WHY are they not taking this drug off.

325, 1, diagnosis of osteoporosis,increased joint and bone pain. Diagnosis of costochondritis and frozen shoulder within 6 months of beginning boniva. My primary care physician who prescribed this medication did not think they were related. Severe pain and loss of sleep from frozen shoulder over 6 months with physical therapy. One year later I still have pain from frozen shoulder and costochondritis.  Increased discomfort and swelling from advancing arthritis. Severe cramps in both calfs overnight. Increased shoulder and back pain. I had none of these symptoms or problems before taking boniva. I will never take this family of drugs again. It wasn't until my periodontist asked how long had I been taking boniva that I really started reading about it.  Why is it the dental community is questioning the drug but my primary care physician just now suggested I stop taking it?,Do your homework. I did not ask enough questions before starting this drug.

Side effects include SEVERE neck/back/chest pain as well as difficulty swallowing and extreme fatigue. Nights are sleepless because I cannot turn easily due to the pain in my neck and back. Every day there is something new to add to the discomfort.  I may go to the hospital this afternoon.  I am generally full of energy but this drug saps every ounce of my energy.  I have had many surgeries for ostio arthritis and have never felt this bad.  I don't know what tomorrow will bring.

Well_ the effects of this drug are cumulative_ in the interim months I have suffered through an unexplained biceps tear_ aches and pains that do not go away_ extreme fatigue_ low red and white blood counts.

338, 1, Osteopenia,I took one dose of Boniva in the morning exactly as prescribed. Later that day_ the bone pain began. I was in so much pain that I could barely move. I wrote down my thoughts and perceptions in a journal. By Day 4_ I was begging for someone to put me out of my misery. During Week 4 post-dose_ I could walk with a cane. After Week 5_ I felt better. I have since read my journal; I was disturbed to read of my thoughts and suffering and have destroyed the journal. I am a nurse who has worked in the pharmaceutical industry for many years. I did what I learned to do: have a medical professional send a MEDWATCH report to the FDA. Any medical professional can and should do this when they learn of such events. While a professional's report carries good weight_ you can report your reaction yourself. I would be remiss not to add that_ while my initial reaction is long gone_ I do experience localized recurrences from time-to-time that do not respond to any therapies_ self-treament or pain medication.,Not a drug to be taken likely. Please ensure that your doctor feels strongly of your need for this therapy. Then_ take a shorter-acting drug first to ensure that you are not sensitive to drugs in this class; this way you will 'wash-out' of the drug much sooner. Only move to a long-acting drug if safe for you to do so. Best wishes.,F,55,1  timesOne dose 1X M,8/6/2010,Boniva

342, 1, Boniva Infusion,STAY AWAY FROM THIS MEDICATION!!  I can't stress this enough.  Just look at the overall rating.  My mother still has effects over 2 years later and she only had 2 Boniva infusions.  I understand there a a very few people who tolerate it okay_ however_ if you are one of the many who react badly it can and will forever change your life.  I had to leave my job to care for my mother who became totally disabled from this drug.  She was unable to twist_ bend_ go upstairs_ use her hands and has had persistent knee issues every since.  We have spent 2 years at Dr. offices trying to get her relief.  We are now convinced that the side effects that remain are there for good.  The drug manufacturer ignores the fact that this drug is permanently disabling people.  My mother was an active woman who walked everyday and was very independent.  This drug has changed all our lives.  We have watched her fail both physically and emotionally as a result of this drug.  Please get the word out to friends and,This drug can and will destroy your life should you react negatively to it.  I know that in the years to come we will begin hearing about the devastating effect this has had on peoples lives.  I hope and pray it is recalled.

Got up and took Excedrin and went back to bed.  Woke up in AM and went to church.  Began to hurt worse and had to leave early.  After returning home pain continued to get worse.  By 2:00 PM it had progressed to a ""10"".  Asked my mom to take me to the hospital (hurting too bad to drive myself at this point) so I could get something for pain.  I thought maybe I had pleurisy_ I had not connected it with the Boniva at this point.  At the hospital they found my normally low bp (normally 115 over 75) to be 200 over 125.  They asked me about what meds I was taking.  It was at that point that I began to wonder if the Boniva could be doing this.  Had only heard of stomach problems with it.  Anyway_ long story short_ spent the night in the hospital on a heart monitor_ lots of tests (ekg_ mri_ cat scan_ echo_...) My symptoms ended up b",Spent 3 months in gradually diminishing amounts of pain (also had weakness in wrists_ would drop things easily) and was on a cane.  3 weeks ago I had a cortisone shot in my hip.

The very first pill gave me slight stomach problems_ but that effect faded within 24 hours and subsequent pills did not bother me.,I have had nothing but great test results since taking this drug.  My doctor told me she had never seen anyone improve so much from one bone density test to the next.  I am fortunate in that I have none of the side effects that I see on this forum and just wanted to let everyone know that not everyone encounters problems.  The people with good results probably do not bother to comment as the drug works as it should and they take it for granted that everyone has the same experience. In most instances people with problems are those that wish to comment as they are living with adverse effects and I can completely understand that.  However_ since I have seen such tremendous bone strengthening from this drug without any ill effects_ I will take Boniva for as long as I need it and/or my doctor advises it.,M,56,2  years150 1X M,6/25/2010,Boniva

Once a month Boniva was easier on my stomach_ but since I started the Boniva my previously well-controlled high blood pressure has gotten out of control_ putting me in the ER at one point.  My inner ear has also been affected_ with dizziness and light-headedness constantly giving me problems.  My health was good and my blood pressure well controlled before starting Boniva_ and there is little doubt in my mind that it is the reason for my current troubles.  I stopped taking the drug two months ago and my blood pressure has slowly improved.  I only hope the remaining side effects go away over time.,The osteoporosis drugs have some serious side effects that are not always made clear beforehand.

379, 1, osteopenia,It was a very hectic week but I decided to start the prescribed Boniva on June 17th because I would remember the 17th every month.  I did not think anything about feeling extra drained as alot was going on.  I attributed body aches to four hours of making posters and banners for an auction event_ but after the third day of feeling sore _ cranky and depressed_ I wondered if the Boniva may have some effect.  I found this site and was astounded.  I had reservations about taking this because I stopped taking Actonel after developing achey joints and muscles.  I will not take any more_ but continue my calcium_ D_ fish oil and daily walks.  A doctor I heard from the WHO said osteopenia is not a reason to take these medications.  My last bone density did show slight loss in hip done density_ but I will stick with over the counter and not the Boniva.

I had terrible pain and disability as well as a fast heart rate.,While getting a second opinion at a major university about my breast cancer treatment_ the oncologist suggested prednisone.

Within a few days of beginning prednisone the pain and disability were noticeably less.  If I currently didnt have (very different) pain from other cancer medicine_ I could probably stop it completely now.  Of course prednisone has side effects_ but what medication doesnt?  Unfortunately my heart rate hasnt gone down_ despite having otherwise a healthy heart_ so I would appreciate hearing about any successes in that area.

Very_ very painful.  Some pain/soreness also on left side of jaw,I have  had pain in my life before and have my share of medical issues_ but this all happening consecutively and right after I began the Boniva regimen_ is all too disturbing to me.  I would never_ ever recommend this drug to anybody...........I personally cannot wait and do hope that this poison works it's way out of my system quickly.  My only saving grace is that I only took 2 months worth and not the yearly Reclast infusion that my doctor wanted me to take.

The pain started from muscles in spasms that lasted up to eight days before relaxing_ then the nerve and bone pain remaining at the site that would gradually fade.  Then the same thing would happen at a different site on my body.  My resting heart rate is up nearly 20 beats per minute.

It would be helpful to know what that it.,Two weeks ago I had a pleurodesis_ which is glueing the inner and outer pleural membranes of a lung together with talc or other modality.  This is because of fluid buildup from advancing breast cancer.  After the surgery the hospital nurses and technical staff commented that I hadn't had epidural anesthesia.  The other pleurodesis patients they knew had epidurals_ because of the significant pain from the procedure.  I had just general anesthesia.

464, 1, Osteoporosis,Terrible pain_ broken femur,"I am writing this short note on behalf of my mother in law who is not very familiar with Internet communications.  My mother in law has terrible problems after taking BONIVA for a while. Most recently her femur broke without any outside force and very likely because of this terrible drug. She was also experiencing incredible bone pain and she could only stand the pain by using extremely strong pain medication. I started to research the web when a physician mentioned that her broken femur could be a result of taking BONIVA. I am simply shocked to find all this information about terrible suffering on the Internet and I am convinced there are a lot of people out there that can't voice their suffering and make it public. IMHO this has nothing to do with ""side effects' of a drug because it can destroy the life of people who took it.  Please_ everybody who has these kinds of terrible problems call FDA at 1800-322-1088 or to speak to someone 888-463-6332. There is a form 3500 that one can download from their web site at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Safety/MedWatch/DownloadForms/UCM082725.pdf. You need to fill out and submit electronically or by mail to file an official complaint. I spoke to a staff member at FDA and she stated that there needs to be a volume of complaints from several people for them to recall but she said that most likely they will if they continue to receive complaints similar to ours.

And the drug has a radio-active component with a long half-life so even if you stop taking it_ it stays in the body for 5-10 yrs. The side-effects are long term! The drug manufacturer states  if you have these symptoms_ stop the drug and see your doc.  That's when you find out the drug stays in your system.  This is a crime!  Doctors prescribing Actonel_Fosamax or Boniva need to be educated!,F,65,7  months,12/8/2009,Boniva
494, 1, Severe Osteoporosis,I immediately had burning in the esophagus_terrible neck muscle spasms_ extreme exhaustion_ stomach cramps. After 4 doses I stopped it.It took me 8 months to get over the agony. I am like a new person now and on Vitamins and Minerals.I would never listen to a doctor again about Boniva or any other medication with the same ingredients.,The FDA should wake up and take this drug with all the chemicals off the market. Doctors are forced to prescribe these to unsuspecting patients like myself.The medication I took was made in Switzerland!I will tell everyone I know about the awful long-lasting side effects it has.If you don't believe it is bad_ go to the Boniva website.,F,77,4  months,12/7/2009,Boniva
495, 1, osteoporosis,Unbearable abdominable pain on day 2 (took first dose yesterday),Took my first dose yesterday morning at 9:30. Followed direction (never had a chance to lie down until 8 PM_ anyway!).  Woke up this morning with incredible abdominal pains..like knives.  I also have RSD which is controlled by pain patches.  Recently I burned myself without knowiong it because the pain meds work so well.  But these pains are more than a level 10 pain. Unbearable.  Feeling like a guinea pig.  If so  many people have problems_ why is this still on the market? OR--Boniva should offer suggestions for controlling pain.,F,55,1  days,12/5/2009Email,Boniva
496, 1, osteoporosis,I began having back pain about 20 hours after taking my first dose of the once monthly version of Boniva. The pain worsened over the next day to the point where I could barely move and it was only moderately responsive to over-the-counter pain medication. My research of the medication on line regarding this side effect was frightening because it sounded like for many people who have experienced muscle pain of this sort after taking this medication_ it does not subside_ and the pain and effect on my mobility was significant. The good news for me is that today -- three days after taking the drug -- I am feeling markedly better_ with around an 80% reduction in the pain I'd been experiencing. I am hopeful that the remaining soreness will subside over the next few days. I will not take this medication again.,,F,51,1  days,12/4/2009Email,Boniva
497, 1, Osteoporosis,Approximately 18 hours after taking 1st dose was awaken with extreme stabbing pain in my back between my shoulder blades.  Thought I was having a heart attack as the extreme stabbing pain started in my chest at the breast bone area. Then progressed into my shoulders.  Haven't slept much since the onset of the pain.  Have never had this much pain.  If I don't move at all it is tolerable.  At times my back and chest will go into spasms which hurts even worse (didn't think it could get any worse}.,I took my first and last dose December 1.  Today is December 3 and the pain is still as intense and the spasms are still extreme.  I have tried to contact my Dr.'s office but they are off today!!!  My husband started looking on the internet last night and discovered this site.  He described my symptoms exactly and said many other women were experiencing the same thing.  I will never take this type of medicine again and just wish the pain would stop. Please stop!!!!! I wish I would have researched the internet before beginning Boniva.  If you haven't started don't.,F,59,1  days,12/3/2009Email,Boniva
498, 4, osteopenia,Not sure if this can be attributed to Boniva_ but have had some leg cramps at night that haven't been helped by vitamin/mineral supplements as they should be. Have had more frequent migraines than normal just recently. However_ in general have had very few side effects and increased bone density with this med. It has helped me more than hurt.,Family history of osteoporosis together with low DEXA readings caused me to opt for Boniva after several months on weekly Actonel. Despite poor teeth_ have had no tooth or jaw pain. No problem with GI upset. No particular joint troubles (I work out 3x weekly). My left hip does bother me at times_ but this is due to an old injury along with slight arthritis. I feel it important for those having few side effects along with reduced bone loss to weigh in here. Not all the stories are bad ones.,F,60,3  years,11/29/2009,Boniva

501, 1, Osteo,Severe left leg pain_ couldn't put any pressure on it to X-country ski & noticed I was using my right leg for all my weight. 1 week after my last injection 1 year ago I ended up in the ER thinking I had the flu but all tests confirmed it wasn't. The Dr. gave me 2 IV's and told me to go home and drink as much fluid as possible. I was off work 2 weeks and now 1 year later am experiencing severe tooth pain_ have had 2 root canals last week on bottom left side. The first thing the Endodontist asked was if I had been on Boniva. This drug is most likely the culprit. I had him test the right side of my lower jaw & there are 2 more teeth that need root canals_ I've never had such a problem and my jaws ache. He said the drug stays in the body 10 years!,Do not take any drug for osteo_ try vitamin D. My rheumy put me on 50_000 units a week for 8 weeks and then just 50_000 units once a month.

502, 1, osteopenia,lower back pain_ hamstring pain_ right hip pain_ problems with acid reflux,I have taken boniva for a year_ once monthly. It was prescribed for me because I was diagnosed with osteopenia_ and osteo arthrithis of the spine. I have horrible lower back pain and leg pain. I wasn't sure what the cause of this might be until I went to a new chiropractor and he told me to check online for the side effects and that should tell me why I am having this pain. I  have been a runner for 20 years of my life and in good shape. But now I hurt so badly all of the time. I am in some kind of pain. I have read the other comment on this site and have seen some that have said they heard that these symtoms are irreversible and the med stays in your body for 5 years. This is very very upseting to me and scary. I would like to know if anyone out there knows if this is factual or not.,F,50,12  months,11/26/2009,Boniva
503, 1, osteoporosis,Severe bone pain,I took Boniva for nineteen months_ from September_ 2007 through March 2009.  I am now 69 years old and reasonably active for a woman my age.My experience with Boniva was uneventful for several months.  In January_ 2009 I began to be awakened at night by pain in my left thigh.  It seemed to be in the femur_ rather than the hip_ and did not seem to correlate with physical activity.  The pain was not constant_ and seemed to travel from one area of my body to another_ to my right knee or either ankle_ to my left knee and back to my left thigh.  There seemed to be no logical explanation for the pain.  I knew that bone_ joint or muscle pain were possible side effects of Boniva_ so after calling my doctor_ I stopped taking Boniva after my March_ 2009 dose.Since that time_ the pains in my lower extremities are less frequent_ but I currently have pain in both my upper arms_ again_ not in the joints_ but in the upper arm bone.  This pain is at times excruciating and at times less severe_ but never disappears completely.  Again_ it does not seem to be related to the degree of my physical activity. I am now convinced that my bone pain is caused by my Boniva use.  I have read that ibandronate does not leave the body quickly (thus its use as a monthly_ or now annual_ medication.)  I now wonder what this medication has done to my bones to cause this extreme discomfort.I feel the drug Boniva should be reviewed as to what permanent adverse effects are being caused by its use.,F,69,19  months,11/24/2009,Boniva

506, 1, Osteoporosis,I took Boniva on Sept 1 and followed up with comments here on 9/17. I suffered back aches and soreness for nearly a month before I felt better_ but the side-effects did eventually go away. I decided not to take it again. My doctor and I decided I would try a daily med (same class of drugs). I have taken Alendronate Sodium for almost two weeks now_ 10 mg per day_ and have no side effects whatsoever. It's generic_ and so it's cheaper. You need to be upright and not eat for at least a 1/2 hour after taking it_ which is really annoying since it's every day_ but it is causing me no pain. Hopefully this lower dose will be tolerated by my body. Nothing was worth how I felt after taking Boniva.,If anyone is interested they can email me for a progress report. The daily med is something to consider_ so talk to your doctor if you are interested. If I start having side-effects from this drug I will update my post.,F,62, ,11/20/2009Email,Boniva

I would have missed work if I took it on a workday.  My doctor talked me in to trying it again_ but she put me on a weekly generic pill that is supposed to do the same as Boniva.  It is just as bad_ extremely sore muscles and joint pain.  I am not taking any more.,I am not taking any more_ due to joint and muscle pain.,F,56, ,11/20/2009,Boniva
508, 1, osteoporosis,"It is impossiable to ""briefly decribe"" the side effects which I experienced_ because there were so many and I am still experiencing some of them_  but I will try to describe them briefly.  I felt as if I was being stabbed in the shoulders_ neck and ribs.  I had rushing_ shooting pains in my back_ and limbs.  I felt like I had a flu.  I started limping and had trouble walking.  I was dizzy and couldn't concentrate.  My whole body ached as if I was run over by a semi.  I felt pain in my jaw.  I am still feeling the stiffness_ and pain in my feet and limbs.  I have had to take off work due to all of the side effects.  I'm wondering if anybody has died from this medication.  I didn't die but while I was on if I felt like I was going to die.  It took me that last dose to realize what was causeing me all the pain.  Now I'm wondering if my golden years will be nothing but pain_ due to bonivia.",This medication is posion.  It is the worst medication I have ever taken.  I only took it three times twice (weekly) and one (monthly).  It has been at least two months since my last pill and I still feel like my body aged 50 years.  I agree that this drug should be taken off the market.  There is no warning that all of these side effects can occur and do not go away.  I do think there should be a class action against this company.  I can't believe that this is actually something that is being given to humans.  If I knew then what I know now_ I would never_ never_ never get near it.

I have such severe joint and muscle pain in my shoulders that I have to bend over in the shower to wash my hair.  Changing clothes is a chore.  I have been to my PC and to an orthodedic surgeon and to physical therapy and a chiropractor.  I didn't realize it was the Boniva until I took a 3rd dose.  Then I started having such severe pain in my hip that I almost couldn't put any pressure on my leg.  My arms are still hurting and in the beginning I slept in my recliner because I couldn't put any pressure on my arms.  I thank all of you for your input and I know the pain that you are going through.

The nurse asked me if I started any new medications and I told her I took Boniva and she thought it could be that since I did not seem to have many flu like symtons. I also have a very salty taste in my mouth. What a terrible medicine.,I would tell everyone to think long and hard before taking this medication.

Recently_ burning sensation in an old rib fracture and hip pain.,My feet gradually improved after stopping taking Boniva. I used a strong Wahl vibrator on my elbow. It hurt like hell_ but seemed to knock off crystalized deposits. The pain left my elbow but radiated slowly away. Then it hit my shoulder. But_ that also came right after having a flu shot where I think the idiot hit the bone. I have experienced a lot of relief using magnets_ including an 85% improvement in the shoulder_ after canceling rotator cuff surgery! I did very little exercise therapy.

I was told to take a Pepcid AC the night before_ then the next morning take the Boniva wait one hour and take another Pepcid AC and then eat breakfast. I have eperienced very little and most of the time no stomach discomofort. Once on the Boniva I began to experience leg pain in my calves and thighs with difficulty walking at times. This has continued the 2 years I have been on the Boniva. I called my OBGYN physician who prescribed the drug and was told my symptoms were not coming from the Boniva. I went to my primary care physician and he performed a physical and did blood work_ everything came back normal. He did prescribe a medication for arthritis but it did not help. I contiuned to take the Boniva and the leg and knee pain continued. Last year I went to an orthopedic doctor and was diagnosed with bursitis in my knees. Very painful. I was sent to therapy for several months in which it did help some yet the symptoms still remained. I continued doing,I am upset that my OBGYN doctor told me that my leg pain would not be coming from the Boniva. Being off of it for the 4 months I have been able to tell a big difference.

528, 1, osteopenia,Pretty much about the same as all of you but mostly daily mid-back pain_ daily doses of vicodin_ side effects from vicodin_ nausea_ weight loss and more now than I can even remember. Over two years I had bone scans_ four CAT scans and four MRI's_ chiropractic treatment_ acupuncture and saw every specialist who might remotely know how to stop the pain.  Two trips even to Cedars-Sinai in LA but nobody could find anything that would be causing the pain so nobody had any idea of how to get rid of it except for vicodin relief.,"BUT it turns out that Boniva might not have been the complete culprit. Although all the experts ""gave up""_ I couldn't. After continuing reading_ researching and talking to other people I saw where mid back pain is a frequent symptom of gall bladder problems.  So had my family doctor send me for a sonogram of my gall bladder.  Sure enough_ the bladder was in bad shape.  Stones_ cysts and ""junk"".  Made an immediate appointment to have it taken out and my back pain was immediately gone. The sonagram is quick_ easy_ relatively cheap and should be everyone's first step in trying to find the cause for much of the problems documented here.  Get it done. You don't have to be in your 70's to have gall bladder problems and not know it because you don't have some of the more classic symptoms. Research ""gall bladder symptoms"". I have talked with people as young as 37 who had the same experience. It's a quick_ easy way to start the process of elimination and may save you years of pain and drug addiction. The vicodin withdrawal was longer and more painful than the gall bladder surgery.  I did it ""cold turkey"".",M,73,7  months,10/22/2009Email,Boniva

531, 1, osteoporosis,My wife began to take this product 4 months ago.  She has exhibited some of the side effects mentioned on this web site.  Such as_  joint pain and muscle pain_ pain in her extremeties_ hard to walk up the steps or go up curb_ pain in legs and hips and hard to sleep at night_ hard to turn over at night_ sore calf muscles like a shin splint_ for no reason. Her back constantly goes out and she is unable to recover_ her back would go out occasionally and she would recover.  Since she started this product it has become progressively worse_ to the point she is unable to recover.  Talked to a nurse today who said she had problems with this type of drug_ and now it fianlly makes sense to me.  It is the Boniva.,I told my wife_ you are off this product immediately.

I've had no flu-like symptoms or stomach symptoms_ just this pain. Advil_ to which I usually respond very well_ seems useless. Vicodin helps a little. I get especially stiff after sitting for a while. Walking seems to help somewhat.,Just a bit of research turns up stats like this: 13% who take Boniva have significant side effects. The manufacturer warns about long-term esophageal side effects. From reading the comments here_ I get the impression that the most common side effect is back pain of some type_ and neck pain. I'm hoping that since the dose is monthly_ after a month I should feel better_ but I have see here that some continue to have this pain long after they stop the drug.

576, 1, osteopenia,I took Boniva for 1 year at the request of my gynecologist.  I took the medication as prescribed_ drinking not 8 oz but 16 oz of water with each dosage.  I stayed upright for 8 hours after taking it.  I developed an erosion at the base of my esophagus and reflux.  When my doctor discovered that I was taking Boniva_ he took me off of it immediately and told me to never take it again.  He said that he has had several patients with the same esophageal erosion that I had.  It took 8-10 months for the erosion to heal.  When it healed_ the reflux disappeared.,,F,64,365  days,8/27/2009Email,Boniva

578, 1, osteopenia,I have to say_ my comments are about ACTONEL.  I did not see Actonel in this otherwise highly useful database.Took the medicine as directed.  That  night I had muscle pain so severe I couldn't sleep.  I also had a nasty_ lead-type taste in my mouth.  I could not get up to brush my teeth as that would have been physical activity too taxing. My husband phnoned the office of the prescribing endocrinologist and they denied the symptoms!!  So_he took me to primary care Dr. the next day_ who was familiar with these side effects and prescribed meds to treat the symptoms.  Good thing he did that_ as I was curled in a ball of agaony in bed.,"Three days later_ feeling better_ able to drive_ etc.  I have to say_ listen to your consumer intutions!

579, 1, osteoporosis,One week after 2nd dose_ intense_ unrelenting sacral and lumbar bone and muscle pain. Could not even get out of bed. I am unable to use my low back muscles. The bone pain is scary different. If I just touch my sacrum the bone aches. I walk like a stiff old_ and I mean old_ lady. This is way different than the pain I had from a slipped disc ten years ago. It's like my bone marrow is on fire. Could this go on forever? After a week now it is just as bad as it was at first. Advil_ Opiates_ Heat_ Ice_ nothing helps.

I was so excited to get a medication that would keep me from becoming what I am right now_ severly crippled. My poor husband has to do everything_ including helping me up so that I can walk a little. I just lay on my couch or bed for a living now. Guess I'll buy some fish oil and vitamins I saw recommended on this site. The FDA ALERT went out 01-07-08 on ""Incapacitating bone_ joint_ and muscle pain in patients taking biphosphonates"". It says health professionals may overlook this side effect_ and their studies did not ask patients how bad their pain was_ or for how long_ just whether they had had joint pain.

581, 1, Ostioperosis,First time I took this drug (June '09)I felt definite joint and headache pain.  It lasted 24 hours. The second time (July '09)I took it and the same thing happened--my entire body felt extreemly sore_ like I had lifted heavy weights_ or was punched all over my torso. The third time was the worst(Aug.'09)_ -I woke up 2:30am with chills (18 hours after taking the pill)_ and was writhing in pain. I was feeling like I had a fever too.  I took an Aleve and it helped me calm down_ and it took away the chills_ I did not sleep_ if at all.  I still had a severe headache the next day and finally 38 hours later (after taking the pill)  before bed I took two Advil and slept through the night. I feel better now but still have joint pain in my back and hips.  I called my DR. to discontinue use. This stuff is bad_ and I would not recommend it.,,F,56,3  months,8/19/2009Email,Boniva

583, 1, bone loss,Started taking Boniva _ Oct. of 2007.  March of 2008 noticed both arms were aching but didnt relate it to my taking Boniva since I had been taking it for 5 months.  Instead _ I just thought it was related to my work which I use my arms a lot.  Finally in Oct of 2008_ (one year of taking Boniva)  I realized it was what was making me hurt and quit taking it but the pain has still been there.  After narrowing it down_  I have found that when I eat vegetables and fruits (especially those that are high in antioxidants) the  pain in my arms are almost intolerable. Also whole grain products do the same.  Spices also are something that makes it hurt.  It usually takes about 4 to 8 hours after I have consumed the food or drink.  When drinking (like grape juice for instance) it seems to hurt quicker than the food.  I guess it goes through faster.,In other words things that are supposed to be good for you are what brings on the pain. When I stay away from them I am pain free.  I have also found some medications make it hurt also.  Hope if anyone out there that is hurting can either try this or maybe you will find what it is that brings on your pain.  Yours may be something all together different.  Just keep trying and maybe you will narrow it down as I have.  Hoping for relief soon.,F,65,1  years,8/14/2009,Boniva

Instead_ increase your intake of natural sources of calcium and do weight bearing exercises for Osteoporosis!I made the mistake of taking ONE 150mg Boniva tablet Saturday morning at 7 AM (August 1_ 2009)_ and by 10 PM that evening_ I thought I was going to die.  The chest and back pain was debilitating and would not go away.  My doctor said to go immediately to the ER.  I did not_ and instead started researching the Boniva side effects on the web.  I found this great web side_ and the recommendations here helped me immensely (plus saved me from a wasted trip to the ER and useless hospital stay).If you've already made the mistake of taking Boniva_ here's what helped me through the pain: (1) Aspirin_ Advil_ Excedrin (rotating usage to minimize side effects)_ (2) Omega 3 Fish Oil_ (3) Calcium tablets_ (4) Multi-vitamins_ and (5) a lot more dairy products (milk_ yogurt_ etc.). I would have tried including individual Vitamin D & K tablets and natural progesterone cream (as recommended by someone on 4/29/2009) _ but I couldn't find them in my local stores.  It's been almost 2 weeks_ and I'm able to control the pain.

He said it was probably just flu like symptoms that would go away. Next day it had gotten worse. Went to see Dr. My neck & shoulders were frozen-had very little movement of my head. Dr offered to hospitalize me if I was not improved the next day.,First 3 days were almost unbearable with the pain & stiffness. This is my 7th day & slowly improving daily. Other than 'inflammation' in my neck xrays & blood work being normal_ it's now time for physical therapy.Don't think Dr is convinced it was caused by Boniva.

Had my bone density scan 2 weeks ago and increased my spine bone density by over 10% and my hip is stable.  I went from a T score of 2.1 to 1.7 in one year. Awesome !!!! I figure 2 more years and I'll have the bones of a 30 year old.  Try breaking your back or hip.  I was lucky but wish I would have gotten serious about it before I broke my vertibrae.  Skiing next year but not the same.  I have arthritis bad_ cleaning my floors kill me.  I'm thrilled something is working.,I think it's great and it's working.

621, 1, Osteoporosis,EXTREME weakness_ nausea_ racing heartbeat_ insomnia_ cramps in my calves and toes_ upper back and neck pain_ constipation.,I began taking this drug on June 1_ 2009 at the advice of my ObGyn. The first day I seemed to be fine until around 1pm. Very suddenly_ I became dizzy and nauseated and had to leave work_ feeling rather like I had the flu. Over the next two weeks_ I noticed that whenever I was the slightest bit stressed_ my face and extremities would turn red and get hot to the touch. Despite menopause_ I've NEVER had hot flashes like these. Today (day 20)_ I was at work and feeling fine until mid-afternoon. Again_ I became very dizzy and faint. The nausea quickly followed. My family is due for an overseas vacation next week and I'm actually afraid the symptoms will 1) be bad on the airplane_ and 2) incapacitate me during our trip. I had thought all of my symptoms would pass but_ after reading comments on this site_ I truly believe that they probably would worsen if I continued taking this medicine. NO MORE BONIVA FOR ME.

623, 1, Osteopenia,Severe cramping of toes and calves.  Flu-like symptoms.  Extreme pain in neck and upper back.,After bad experience on Fasomax (developed severe reflux_ coughing_ and felt like I was developing an ulcer)_ I took Actonel for two years. I now wonder if the cramping of my calves and increased reflux causing me to constantly clear my throat was related to the use of Actonel.  My insurance company took Actonel off their formulary.  When I requested a prescription for Boniva_ my physician gave me two monthly sample packets_ suggesting I try it before getting a prescription.  I took one monthly dosage of 150 mg_ following directions closely as I am being treated for reflux (daily Previcid).  Within the first week I began experiencing excruciating nighttime cramping of my toes_ feet and calves...reducing me to tears and requiring me to get up out of bed to stretch and relieve the cramping almost every night.  Now_ during the second week since taking the 150mg of Boniva_ I am experiencing ongoing flu-like symptoms daily.  For the last three days I have been incapacitated with excruciating pain in my neck and upper back.  I have obtained little relief from frequent rotations of heat/ice.  I am now experiencing sleep deprivation due to the pain_ despite the use of Advil.  I am a very healthy_ active woman (skied 3 days a week all last winter_ regularly hike and kayak).   This is very disturbing.  Decided to research Boniva and went looking for consumer feedback; found this web-site AFTER experiencing all these distressing side-effects.

635, 1, Start of osteoporosis in spine,After taking Bonviva for six months_ I was woken in the night by severe pain in the right sacro-iliac area_ which radiated into groin and down leg.  I had to lift my right leg to go up the stairs_ get into and out of car.   The pain started the very night after I had taken my sixth_ monthly dose in the morning.   The pain lasted 7 weeks and made me really depressed_ not to mention the weight I put on through being unable to be my normal_ active self.,I called my gyneo to see if the pain could be a result of taking Bonviva but he adamantly denied that it could be the medication.   Instead_ he told me to go to my general doctor_ which I did_ and he did loads of movement tests on me before sending me for two x-rays and an echograph.  He didn't think it could be the Bonviva either_ as he said it normally only affects the jaw-bones.  The x-rays etc. were all perfectly clear_ so my condition was a mystery.  The doctor then put me on a short course of cortisone and very powerful pain-killers_ which did no good at all_ so I was convinced it was the Bonviva that was causing the pain.   We women know our bodies and have gut-feelings about these things.  Thankfully_ my doctor suggested I go see an osteopath_ and she was my life-saver.  The pain went within two days_ which was probably due to her massaging the bones and muscles.  However_ the other day I started with identical pain in the left side_ so that has just confirmed my suspicions.   I am going to get an appointment with my gyneo and tell him what I think - and also stop taking Bonviva.  I'm disgusted that these doctors give us medications which are so harmful - they're obviously on commission from the drug manufacturers.   For those of you suffering with continual pain_ I would recommend you go see an osteopath - it was wonderful to be pain-free after so long_ as I never normally suffer with back or leg pain.,F,58,8  months,6/3/2009,Boniva

Also check out www.weightvest4osteoporosis.com for an easy way to work weightbearing exercise into your day.,"Here's my bottom line.  NO treatment should be worse than the disease.  Whatever happened to ""First_ do no harm?""  The bisphosphonates actually set you up for long term fracture since they prevent osteoclast activity.  Osteoclasts eat away at old bone so osteoblasts can come along and make new bone.  You make new bone your whole life through this 2 step process.  If you prevent the osteoclasts from doing their job by taking these so-called bone building drugs_ then you will keep that old bone_ making your numbers look better for a while_ but the bone that stays is old bone that becomes brittle over time_ setting you up for a serious fracture down the road.  It blows my mind that the drug co's get away with peddling these drugs that not only cause all these horrible side effects_ but they actually DO NOT WORK for their intended purpose over the long haul_ which is what matters.

By Saturday the pain had eased quite a bit but I still hurt more that usual.  No word back from doctor yet but the pharmacist told me one of the side affects was incapacitaing bone pain (DUH) and this stuff can stay in your system OVER A YEAR!  So there is no way to get it out.

Stairs are impossible so I am using the freight elevators.  They have also granted me permisson to drive in the gate so I can park close to the buildings.  I have a doctors appt. on Monday so I'll see what she says.  Five years to get this out of my system brings me to tears.  This drug should be taken off the market.

704, 1, Osteoporis,I have had occasional bouts of nausea_ etc._ but nothing that lasts more than a day or two after a dose.  My bigger concern is that it appears to be making my osteoarthritis worse.  I have had 2 back surgeries - the last one major - to remove over grown facets from the L-5 vertebra and fusing it to the S-1.  Relief was incredible!  However_ in the past 2 months_ I have noticed about a week after each dose new arthritic pain - first in one hip and now the entire area that had been fused during surgery.  I have no proof that the Boniva is responsible for this_ but since it prevents bone degradation and enhances new bone growth_ it makes me very suspicious_ especially since I have the tendency for arthritic over growth anyway.,,F,60,3.5  years,3/9/2009,Boniva
705, 1, osteoporosis,Severe_ severe bone pain_ muscle pain_ inability to walk.,I originally posted comments on 5-13-06 and 5-17-06.  After about 1-2 years_ my side effects from Boniva ended. But_ like most of you_ I wondered what to do about my osteoporosis.  I was afraid to take any other meds as they all have some side effects that were disturbing to me.  In 2007_ my bone density was -3.8.  My physician kept pushing all the meds on me_ and I refused each one.  Instead_ I started taking a new calcium supplement 3 times a day giving me 150% of the RDA for calcium.  Eventhough_ my new calcium had magnesium_ I increased my magnesium_ too.  I've been on this regime for a little over 2 years.  I just had a new bone density.  I'm now at a -1.3!!!!  Still not perfect_ but much improved without drugs.  My physician was very pleased and did not push any drugs.  He told me to keep doing what I'm doing.  Also_ since taking the extra calcium and magnesium_ I have fallen several times and have had no fractures.  I've done nothing else (like weight bearing exercises) to help.,F,55,90  days,3/8/2009Email,Boniva

708, 1, Pre-osteoperosis,I took my first Boniva 5 days ago. I am 56 years old but very energetic and in good shape.  On the second day I started having stomach pains. I thought it was something I ate. I was very gassy and constipated. My lips were extremely dry even though I was drinking a lot of water. The 3rd day_ I hardly had the energy to get out of bed. Now it is day 5 and I am still experiencing stomach pain_ dryness_ constipation_ and fatigue.

I had to crawl out of bed.  I should have gone to the ER for some morphine or something.  It lasted 2 days and nights severely and then started getting better.  It has been 3 months now and it is time to get another IV.  Since I have taken this medicine_ I have gained 10 pounds of ""water"" weight.  At least I think it's water weight.  When I take my socks off_ there is a huge indention on my leg. Having second thoughts about taking this second dose.",,F,57,1  times,3/5/2009Email,Boniva

712, 1, osteopenia,I took my first dose 2 days ago being vigilant about following the directions closely. I had hoped that this could help me  get ahead of any further bone loss and maybe even gain some of the loss back. Yesterday_ I began experiencing SEVERE pain in my abdomen and my back felt very achy. By evening_ I could hardly breath it hurt so much and my whole body ached. I could not sleep all night and today feel it even more severely... as though I've been beaten all over my body with a bat. The pain in my abdomen is relentless and takes my breath away. It feels as though it's on fire.  If this is the result of a single dose of Boniva and not just an isolated case as evidenced by this site_ it should be off the market today!! Concerned how long this is going to last. Too weak and do not feel well enough to do anything.  Very upsetting.Got out of bed and came online because I felt desperate to investigate any potential side effects not listed in their insert_ not sure if this could possibly be,Stay away from it!Stick to calcium and vitamin D instead with moderate exercises like walking_ swimming_ yoga and some light weight bearing exercises.,F,52,2  days,3/3/2009,Boniva

However_ the knee and shoulder never felt like this before!Does anyone know where to find the research that indicates how long (five years?) it takes to pass from the body?

I had to wait until it went through my system. I took my one and only dose on Dec. 5_ 2008. I am just now starting back to running. I see the cardiologist tomorrow to see if I have any permanent damage. My last visit with him he said I was the third patient he'd seen that day with the same symptoms that had taken boniva.

I went to the Mayo Clinic and had joint scans and x-rays that show mild inflammation.  My pain is severe_ I have tried NSAIDS and they don't work.  The only help the doctors offered was to take Motrin 4x a day for 4-6 months.  It has been 4 months and absolutely no improvement in pain.  The doctor said that the half life of the drug in our bones_ is 5 years.  I am shocked to consider that I may have to endure 5 years of this pain after 2 pills.,Please contact me via the email link if you are interested in a class action lawsuit designed to get the word out on this drug_ stop the prescribing of this drug and reimburse us for the months and years taken from us due to this pain.,F,50,2  months,2/25/2009Email,Boniva

732, 1, osteoporsis,Started out taking Boniva on a monthly basis with side effects mild and eventually developed GERD too severe to continue.  Quarterly injections were prescribed because it will bypass the stomach.  I've had three injections with mild bone pain but the last injection I have developed severe right hip pain with burning and pain radiating down the leg.  Could not walk without hanging on to a wall and stairs were impossible. A bone scan showed no arthritis or bursitis and was told that it was a bone spur due to calcium build up.  PT is helping quite a bit. Just a few days ago I am having right jaw pain and around the gums and I will pray that it is not Boniva related.

By Monday_ I thought I was dying.  Flu like symptoms all day and fever and chills at night.  Still have pain in the hip area and can't get rid of the nausea. Feel very_ very tired. Drinking orange juice with vitamin D and taking Tylenol seemed to help a bit. Have tried Actonel before and also had severe hip pain.  Don't think my body agrees with this class of drugs for Osteoporosis.  Heard there's new drug coming on market in about a year--can't wait!  Until then_ I will take my chances with exercise_ Vitamin D_ & Calcium.,I also think that the Boniva Drug Company & FDA needs to relook at their clinical trials.

I've placed a call to my Doctor who will tell me that ""it isn't the drug"" and to take it again next month.  She knows me well enough to know that isn't going to happen.  It scares me to read comments from others that this may last for an unspecified amount of time.",I can't imagine why any doctor would prescribe this to a patient.  It must be some kind of financial incentive that has them pushing this on people.  I will never take this again.,F,45,1  times,1/21/2009,Boniva
756, 1, Osteopenia,Within 2 months of taking Boniva_ I started noticing swollen finger joints accompanied by general joint pain_ particularly the fingers and knees. I also suffered chest pains and went to the hospital and am now scheduled for a stress test. I feel terrible and have a general sluggishness. I am always feeling tired and I was a previously active_ very healthy feeling adult.,"Horrible. Would not recommend this drug to anyone. Sally Fields should be made of aware of this potentially dangerous drug so she can change her position. After my initial problems with my swollen finger joints_ a friend suggested it could be the Boniva. I immediately decided not to take any more after 3 months. I am just hoping and praying my finger joint problems and knees will improve when this ""crap"" gets out of my body. I sure hope this is not irreverseable as my joints are awful now. I'll take my chances with the ostheopenia and a little more calcium and vitamin D. This has really upset and depressed me that I feel so bad after being so healthy all my life.",F,57,3  months,1/21/2009Email,Boniva

806, 3, Osteoporosis,The first three months I had no side effects. The fourth and sixth months I had flu like symptoms the day after taking the pill which lasted about 36 hours. Also_ the day after my 6th dose (month) I began having excrutiating pain in one leg and one arm. I also had occasional chest pains. If I drank a carbonated drink the chest pains would go away.,Because I am hoping this medication helps my osteoporosis instead of discontinuing using it_ I paid close attention to what I did different the times I had the bad reactions. My conclusion: I did not drink enough water and was fairly inactive those two times. These last three months I have made sure I drink at least 16 ounces of water and try to keep physically busy after my hour is up_ like cleaning the house or activities where I am using most of my body. I also make sure I eat a good breatfast about 1 1/2 hours after taking the pill. I have had absolutely no side effects the last three doses and the pain in my limbs_ for the most part_ has gone away.

My doctor prescribed Fosamax for me for this problem but_ after taking it for 7 weeks_ I started having increased heartburn and burping up acid in my mouth and throat.(I have had GERD for about 10 years which I had informed my doctor about).Also after the first day of taking Fosamax_ I had a severe headache.I had been taking Prilosec for about 10 years to keep my GERD under control_ which it did. She told me I could go up to 4 tablets a day of the Prilosec to control the incresed heartburn caused by the Fosamax but_ even taking 4 a day did nothing to help. I told her of the problem I was having and she switched me to Boniva. The problem did not improve but got worse. I have only taken one tablet of Boniva and do not plan to take anymore. I still have the bad heartburn and wake up every morning with burning in my throat and s,I also have occassional twinges of pain in my joints in various places and some swelling in my feet and ankles and sometimes bad headaches. But_ the heartburn is the biggest problem. It feels as if someone has a lit match in my throat. My doctor has told me I can stop the Boniva_ which I am going to and to go and talk to an infusion doctor about a once a year infusion medication. She says this one should not have the same side effects_ namingly the heartburn as the Boniva and Fosamax but_ I will see what the infusion doctor says. With the way my throat feels most of the time I am afraid If I take any more of the Boniva I will eventually get erosions in my Esophagus which can lead to cancer. I would rather deal with the osteoporosis/osteopenia then have to worry about getting cancer one day from taking this medicine.

If you're not allergic to the ingredients in Claritin_ and you have severe bone pain from Boniva that nothing has yet relieved_ perhaps you might try it.

My last two cleanings have required extra care.  The plaque has been much more and more difficult to remove than ever in the past.  The doctor first asked me about changes in my dental habits_ which there were none.  Then he asked if I was on any new medicines.

I found I had a vitamin D deficiency right after I started breaking my ribs.  My former primary didn't test for Vitamin D so I have no idea how long I had the deficiency.

The next morning when I got up_ I could hardly walk_ I kid you not! My back hurt so badly_ I wanted to scream! I have a high tolerance to pain_ but this was nothing I've ever felt before_ like someone reached inside the mid of my back & ripped it apart. I took many pain pills that day & nothing would even touch it. I was ready to call an ambulance_ & I don't go to the ER unless I'm dying. Back & leg pain was present for the next 4 dys_ not quite as bad_ but bad enough. I could hardly walk/move. It is now Mon_ 12 dys later_ & I've had a horrible headache & felt nauseous all day. Plus_ my emotions have been all over the place & I awoke this morning having a nightmare!

Then came stabbing pain in my bones that actually made me jump. These were sporatic and at random locations throughout my body. I left work thinking I had a virus_ went home and immediately to bed. I awoke with violent vomiting that lasted through the night. The next day I could not get out of bed_ and missed work for the first time in five years. I could not eat or drink. By day three the symptoms lessened somewhat_ but the severe back ache set in and is still present after seven days. My joints ache_ especially the knees_ making it difficult to get out of a chair. My sternum is sore and I have weakness in my legs. If this drug is a cure_ I don't want it! I'll take my chances on a broken bone.

I contributed it to the Mexican food I had eaten 2 hours earlier.  During the course of the night I started feeling the flu like symptoms.  The next day_ my whole body hurt_ even the hair on my head hurt.  Sounded like the flu to me.  But I didn't have a fever or any other symptoms of the flu.  By the end of the first day_ I had excriciating pain in my neck going up my head.  I used some Ben Gay pads but that did not work.  I went to bed and woke up exhausted with tightness in my chest and still quite achy.  I spent the day on the couch and did not go to work.  The next day_ the pain subsied somewhat but the exhaustion still existed and it does now_ 6 days later.  I have been taking Mobic for the past few days to help with the aches and also started taking plain Vitamin D.  I hope that this feeling ends soon.,I would definitely think twice about taking this pill.  If vit D makes a difference as to the tolerance of this drug_ physicians should check the vitamin D level before prescribing this medication.

The next several days I could not walk without someone helping me_ I could not get out of a chair or even put my own legs up on my bed at night. After calling my doctor he told me to stop taking Boniva and begin taking Benadryl four times a day for three days to help stop the reaction. I am able to walk using a cane to help balance me. Boniva did not work for me!,I took the once a month tab - 150 mg,F,51,1  days,9/6/2008,Boniva
888, 5, severe osteopenia,First time I took it I had the flu-like symptoms. The second time_ no problems. Make sure your Dr tests you for Vitamin D - if you are deficient_ you will not tolerate this drug!!!,This is GREAT!  My bone density improved 4% since last year.

890, 1, Bone loss,Severe back pain started day after taking one 150mg Boniva. That was a month ago and the pain now is only slightly better. Just one dose of this deadly drug has made me a cripple.,The mechanism of Boniva makes as much sense as bunging up one's rear end to promote weight increase. It does NOT promote bone growth but inhibits the elimination of old bone. Result is that bones become more brittle and delicate. No wonder people's jaws are disintegrating and their teeth falling out. This drug will kill you. Be warned!,F,79,1  times,9/3/2008,Boniva

893, 1, osteopenia,Folowing the day I took Bonivia I thought I had a virus; start of headache and stomch upset.  This progressed into the worst headache of my life and severe stomach cramps_ The previous week I had a colonoscopy and I thought this might have been a result of that procedure.  I called that Doctor and was advised that too much time had elapsed between the procedure and my present symptoms. The symptoms progressed to stomach spasms and chills.  This is the 5th day and most of the symptoms_ other than cramps have gone.  I called my doctor and am waiting for a return call.  I had taken fosamax without incident but stopped on the suggestion of my dentist.  I am going back to the natural way; juicing kale_ collards_ broccoli_ etc_ continue weight bearing exercise and lots of sunshine.,Your doctor does not always know best. They don't have time to keep up on all the literature.  Medicine is not a science.  It is learn by error.

894, 1, Osteopena,I have been on Boniva for about 18 months and I believe that the symptoms I have are cumulative or perhaps I just did not recognize the symptoms as relating to Boniva.  For example_ I have been suffering with severe jaw pain for a long time and needing to take Tylenol at least 2 times daily.,Most recently my left upper arm and shoulder has been aching and sleeping any more than five hours a night is unheard of.

In and out of bed most of the day---too much effort to move around. I reread the package insert and figured it was a first time problem. The symptoms wore off within five days.Second  time: August 19_ 2008_ I took exactly as directed. Felt fine for first 12 hours_ then horrible flu like symptoms set in (I have had to take off from work). Absolutely no appetite. Intense aching muscles in back_ ribs and shoulders_ particularly the right shoulder blade and to the front of my chest...breathing is difficult at times.. Jaw pain unable to sleep at nights_ and difficulty getting out of bed..chills_ sweating_ and  numbing headache (headache is something new for me).  That was 9 days ago and I still feel achy and out of sorts. I hurt all over_ can't breathe well_ and walk very slowly with stiff movements.

901, 1, osteopenia,First several months of taking Boniva my right knee started throbbing at night with pain becoming excruciating. Over next weeks knee fluid built up as nightly pain increased. Knee had to be drained and steriods administered which alleviated pain in knee. That was just the start of repercussions from this HORRID medication. Next came upper back and shoulder blades pain_ particularly right side. This pain migrated up to neck and even skull behind ears_ which caused moderate ear aches. Was not able to turn head more than a few degrees. Pain in neck was severe. Leg muscles cramping in legs at night. Chronic headache though not severe_ is unpleasant. One month after stopping Boniva leg cramps are diminishing and pain is only in neck area. When does it stop?,No longer will I blythly take a doctor prescribed med until I check it out. I feel blessed to have found this website. Found it purely by chance. Being miserable is bad enough without knowing what was causing my pain. After five months of once-a-month Boniva I realized what it was that caused this total upsetting change in my body. Particularly as exercise_ balanced meals and a healthy life style IS my life style. (I do love my red wine_ too_ but in moderation.) Chiropractic visits twice a week plus massage therapy was of little or no help. Every woman I know has been made aware of the debilitating effects of Boniva and I will continue to speak out against it.,F,70,5  months,8/15/2008Email,Boniva

Very painful at times.,I first took Fosamax until I started having severe heart burn.  My doctor (ob-gyn) suggested I try Boniva injection once every three months.  After the first injection I had flu like symtoms which went away.  After the second injection my knuckle on the index finger on the hand enlarged so much and the finger and portion of the hand between the index finger and thumb was swollen.  It looks like I have a double knuckle it is so big.  I went to several orthopedic surgeons_ had MRI and x-rays and shots of cortosone.  They could not determine why the knuckle enlarged as much as it did in such a short time.  The ob-gyn doctor who injected the boniva says it is from the Boniva.  I agree.  It is almost 2 years now since the last injection_ the knuckle is still enlarged and swollen whenever I use it a lot.  Of course it's on my right hand and I am right handed.  I called the pharmacutical company and they said they never received any complaints like this from their product.  As I can see from,F,57,3  months,8/11/2008Email,Boniva

The next day I felt a little tightness in my chest and by the following day it got so bad I considered going to the hospital.  The fourth day after taking Boniva my symptoms began to disappear and by the fifth day I was fine again. However_ the next week I started to experience severe pain under my right ribs and eventually could not take the pain and went to the emergency room. After blood work and many tests_ they could not find anything wrong. At first they thought it might be gall bladder but Ihad it removed 10 yrs earlier.

After 2 weeks I thought the symptoms had subsided so I took my next dose on schedule (6/11/08). That was a mistake. The leg muscle ache came back much worse_ along with with can be described as ""restless leg syndrome"". I could only sit for short periods of time. I also experienced ache and tingling in my left arm_ along with intermittant upset stomach_ dizziness and headache. On several occasions_ I had chest pains and a sense of ""momentary amnesia"". I also experienced sensitivity in my teeth and a strange sensation around my 2 dental implants. I have not taken a pill since! I hope these symptoms go away soon_ because I felt fine before taking Boniva.",I suspect that most women think that taking Boniva is harmless. Maybe for most it is_ but I think doctors should advise you to closely monitor symptoms - and they should monitor us much more carefully while on this medication.

Late last year_ blood tests revealed that I had low iron (I don't eat red meat) and Vitamin D levels_ which have now been corrected with supplements.  Thankfully_ my endocrinologist thought to order a bone scan for me as he was concerned that the low Vitamin D levels might indicate that my body was not absorbing calcium.

I am an RN and reread the drug info sheet and saw that side effects often occur about 24 hours after taking.  My doctor thankfully_ recognized this as a possible side effect.  I began taking percocete for TWO weeks because of unbearable pain as soon as I tried to get out of bed in the am.  Several days later while still having bone pain I got terrible flu symptoms_ G.I. chills_ weakness.  I had to stay in bed that whole week and continued to have serious bone pain for FIVE weeks.,I can honestly say that I felt like I had aged 30 years one day after taking the boniva.  I used to go to the gym and work out with weights_ pilates and yoga 5 days/week.  That stopped after I took the boniva.  It has now been almost 2 months since I took the one and only dose.

1020, 3, Osteopenia,I have been on Boniva for exactly 1 year now.  I will have my next bone density test this summer_ so I will have been on it 18 mos. by that point.  I am hopeful for some slowdown in bone loss and will be thrilled to find some increased bone density.  I am very sorry to hear of the problems women here have had. I honestly can say that I have not experienced any of the pain or GI issues noted here.  I came to this site_ however_ to find out if weight gain has been a problem with Boniva users. I am post-menopausal and I did gain weight with menopause_ but it seems I gained much more all of a sudden in the past year_ and I cannot account for it any other way.,This site required a 1-5 rating to post comments and I cannot honestly say the medicine helped or did not help.  I did not have my scan yet.,F,56,12  months,2/14/2008,Boniva

I felt horrible x 2 weeks_ then started Fosamax_ which is a lower dose of medication in the same drug sategory as Boniva_ and had the same symptoms.,Would definitely recommend other treatment if possible.

I've had radiation on my neck and chest and that is where most of my pain is.  I broke my leg eight years ago and where the bone came out and caused soft tissue damage_ is sore to the bone!  But the very worst place is my neck!!! it is so sore_ I cannot move.  I get almost an electrical shock like sensation when I move around at all... have had to wear neck brace to minimize movement but it doesn't help much.  Sleeping positions are almost impossible.  And from what I've read_ it will take awhile to get better.... I feel like I'm going to die but at least the pain would go away.   I've only taken one dose!!!,F,61,1  weeks,2/7/2008,Boniva

I have been in pain since I was 37_ take a whole lot of medications but am never pain free so it is difficult to pin down exactly what Boniva causes. I have not been taking it for months though because frankly_ I am in so much horrible pain in the morning I cannot wait an hour to take my pain meds_ which you cannot take when you are taking Boniva. I was going to promise myself to take it some how if I found evidence that it is working for others but instead I find these terrible reviews. Thank you for giving me an excuse to push this one off my list! Has it worked for anyone to increase bone mass?

I was having chest pressure and trouble breathing so much I couldn't get up. Had testing done_ heart ok. Blood pressure went up (used to be low). Pain everywhere! Hip_ thigh_ lower back (had xrays done of lower back to see what the problem was_ they were fine)_neck_ shoulder and shoulder blade and even fingers. I never take meds and I was always very active but when I had early menopause(age 40) and bone thinning_ I thought I would be proactive. What a mistake! I will not take another pill. Now I know why I am always more tired than I ever was. I chalked all the symptoms up to aging and possible arthritis. I will not take another boniva!

1031, 1, osteoporosis,I have been taking Boniva for 1 year_ but thought the side effects were due to my IBS.  After reading the messages_ I am convinced its the Boniva.  Side effects include upper stomach pain_ aching feet and ankles_ shoulder blade pain and a general lack of energy.  I work out and am in good shape for my age_ but this medication is interfering with my life. I am going to stop taking it for a couple of months to see if my symptoms subside.  My stomach pain has been the worst.  I have had two gallbladder tests to see if it wasnt functioning properly.  They were negative as was a colonoscopy.  No more tests for me!

1033, 1, Diagnosed with osteoporosis,Severe_ agonizing_ debilitating left shoulder pain.......Learned about the drug causing these symptoms and immediately discontinued using it. BISPHOSPHONATES are poison to your body and bones. Learn what you can about them........How Bisphosphonate Bone Drugs WorkThe bisphosphonate bone drugs work in two main ways:A) By killing osteoclasts  the carpenter cells in charge of the demolition part of the remodeling process. New healthy bone cannot be built by osteoblasts until old worn bone has been removed by osteoclasts.B) By gluing calcium onto bone in abnormal ways_ providing the appearance of greater bone density. However_ this is like nailing a piece of plywood over a hole in the wall. Yes_ there is something there_ but it is not a normal wall and it does not have the proper strength of a normal wall.Once bisphosphonates arrive at bone they are stuck there forever_ as a completely abnormal substance residing within and on the bone.

Every dose after got better_ but by the 4th month of taking the medicine I have been experiencing severe abdominal cramping_ gas_ bloating_ and constipation. I have now changed my diet and am taking pills for gas. Last month in preparation for a routine colonoscopy I had a severe reaction to the prep medicine and was unable to go forward with the screening. I have never in my life experienced these kinds of symptoms. I am going off the Boniva after reading others are experiencing the same symptoms and there seems to be a pattern of worsening health the longer you stay on it-which appears to be what is happening to me.,,F,52,7  months,1/28/2008,Boniva

Loss of appetite. I also passed gas_ so much so that it would wake me up at night just to bare down and do it.  My stomach gurgled all the time.  I had a headache_ slight fever_ no energy.  Day 3_ still had severe stomach cramps but not every 5 minutes like the day before.  Still no energy_ farting all the time and I developed an awful taste in my mouth.  Still feared to eat.  I didnt know what to eat in fear of what would set my stomach off.  Also noticed that I have vaginal burn sensation.  Day 4_ still cramping but not as bad.  Still have bad taste in my mouth.  SEVERE vaginal burn.  Have a little more energy.  How much longer wi,I will never take again.  Also the doctor said that none of the other bone prevention medicanes will work for me.

1037, 1, osteoporosis,From the start - feet ached_ even after buying expensive shoes__ Rt. elbow & arm ached_ then ankles became stiff & achy upon awakening - attributed this to age & arthritis setting in. Around New Years of 2008_ began having hip & leg pain_ even woke me up during night. Pain would vary on both sides. The pain in the hip would be a shooting pain. the pain in the legs would vary from achy to feeling restless & wanting to jump out of my body to burning to throbbing in one area. I also started having gastric burning in the evening_ had flu-like symptoms 3 times between Christmas & New Year's_ feeling very tired & no energy even after sleeping 8 to 9 hours. Urine began to have strange odor.,I became concerned about the recent symptoms & found this web-site.

Gradually_ my body has gotten back to normal except for my knees which still ache when I stoop down and try to get up. During the year 2006_ I was hospitalized twice_ had every blood test known to man_ body scans_ sent to a urologist to check for urinary tract infections_ ENT to see if my tonsils were horboring a recurring infection_ and finally an infectous disease doctor_ all with no answers.  I think my horrible ordeal is finally over. All of the doctors told me that the drug could not be in my system that long_ but I disagree. However_ the infectous disease doctor's last statement to me when he could find no answer to my illnesses was ""I",AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. Also had taken FOSAMAX a couple of years before the Boniva and gradually began having rib and shoulder pain_ same as Boniva only not as extreme. My gynecologist told me to never take any osteoporosis drugs again because they all have a common ingredient_ Bisphosphonates_ that is probably the culprit.,F,57,2  months,1/24/2008,Boniva

After the 2nd or 3rd time taking the pill I would get sick in the middle of the night.  The 5th time I took the pill the symptoms were so severe I thought of taking myself to the emergency room.  I kept moaning I'm sick_ so sick.  After speaking toa friend the next day she reminded me that I was sick like that last month.  I went on the computer to finde the side effects of Boniva.  There they were - all those that I had experienced.  I never connected feeling so sick to the Boniva before that.  It is 3 months since I stopped taking this and the bones in my hands are still killing me_ I get pain in other areas but not constantly.  Sally Field needs to stop promoting this drug.  It is awful.

It's really clear that you see doctors that don't keep up with osteoporosis and didn't do a proper workup to make sure you were in the proper range of hydroxy25 vitaminD levels >30 before starting treatment.  Shame on them.  If you are vitamin D deficienct you will be feeling horrible and think you are dying.  If you are vitamin D deficient you are probably hypocalcemic which is a contraindication to use any of these medications_ so your doctor is liable.  I'd suggest getting educated on bone health and learning about being worked up properly and then starting treatment.

I have been taking Boniva for 2 yrs and never dreamed it could be the reason for my radiating bone pain_ joint and muscle aches. Before taking Boniva_ I could go up and down stairs_ get on my knees to work in the garden_ get out of my chair with no problem_ walk at a very fast clip. When I began to feel like a 90 yr old woman_ could not get down on the floor or up from the floor without help_ could not sit to watch TV without my bones_ joints_ and muscles hurting - I just didn't know what had happened to me. Well_ after reading all these comments_ now I know what has been wrong with me all these months. Boniva. Otherwise I am a very healthy person_ work full time_ my yearly check-ups and blood work are always perfect.

1062, 1, Osteoporosis,I took it very hesitantly for the first time on 12/29/07 at 4:45 AM.  Within an hour I felt weak but seem to feel a little better.  About 5 PM I had a lot of gas and hadn't eaten anything since breakfast at 7AM.  My stomach was gurgling and making a lot of noise.  I thought it was the cat but it was me.  I didn't sleep the first night because I felt like I was having a heart attack.  I had pain in my shoulders snd down my arms_ heart burn_ and a lot of gas for hours. I hurt to move.  I woke up like I had been hit by a truck_ had a bout of diarrhea_ and ran a fever all day and quite high in the afternnoon.  I had no energy and hurt when I moved.  I took an ambien determined to sleep last night and that didn't help.  I had diarrhea during the night followed by abdominal cramping.  Took some ibuprofen and finally fell asleep.  Today (into my 3rd day)_ I have no energy_ feel cold all over except for my head which feels warm.  My abdomen is still hurting and sometimes spasming. I have a pai,I tried fosamax several years ago when it was still osteopenia.  Had sever pain in the abdomen after one.  After two the pain lasted 3 days.  After the third the pain lasted until the next pill which I didn't take.  It's no way to live.  I can't believe I tried it again. Thanks for the info on the IV because I'm sure that will be the next thing which is suppose to avoid the stomach problems.  Oh yea!  My big question is what kind of a drug is this that reverses all the good when you go off of it.  It's like a death sentence.,F,59,1  times,12/31/2007Email,Boniva
1063, 1, osteopena and Osteporis,I've previously posted but don't know how to update. I've had so many email to ask how long this poison stays with us..The hell of Boniva is finally out of my system.  Took about 4 months and my bones ache still but its better.  I've found a  dr. that suggested testing my body for Vitamin D defiency.  At a certain age and certain meds_ our bodies deplete our Vit D. My best friend is on 50_000 ie 2 times a week.  Low d can cause bone pain_ brittle bones and tiredness.  I'll know Wed. how low mine is.Boniva made my life hell.  My legs ached_ I couldn't climb stairs and I felt like I had the flu_ not to mention the vomiting and acid reflux.  Apparently all of us are right and the lawsuits are beginning http://www.anapolschwartz.com/practices/fosamax/Boniva-Actonel.shtml  I tried emailing Sally Fields to let her know what she was endorsing_ was killing us.  Now we face more problems from taking this drug.My email is cindy.badder@ky.nacdnet.netYou all aren't alone,If you are still having symptoms after stopping.  Drink plenty of water or gatorade_ do plenty of stretching and walking even though it hurts and please ask your dr to test your vitamin D.Sally Field_ if you check in_ get this poison off the market.

Within minutes there was a nasty taste in my mouth_ and then within another 15 minutes started vomiting a bright yellow liquid - it wasn't coming from my stomach.

It is now 72+ hours after the first dose and my fingers are still swollen_ my stomach aches_ the tinnitus is still a problem_ and the high active energy level I had 5 days ago is gone.  I feel depressed. I really wish I had never taken this medicine. I hope the signs and symptoms will reverse.,I will never take this medicine again.  It will be interesting to see if the FDA continues to approve this medication for use the way it is currently being used.  If we were men I think the FDA would currently be reacting differently.  And_ I can't help but think that with the rate of progress in joint replacement therapies that it would be better to take our chances at needing hip surgery in 10-20 years instead of taking this medication.,F,52,4  days,12/6/2007Email,Boniva

After an hour of straightening and organizing the clutter of my bedroom and closet_ I could literally feel the Boniva going through my body and did not like this sensation.  Felt tired all day as I was trying to decorate for Christmas.  After about eight hours_ extreme diarrhea set in.  Spent most of the afternoon and into the night in the bathroom.  Approx 10 hours after taking the pill_ I experienced what I thought might be a heart attack . . . extreme_ and I am talking extreme shortness of breath to the point where I had to sit down on the top step of the stairs and after a few seconds could not even sit there but layed back on the floor.  I was just gasping for air and thought I was going to become violently ill.  After about 10 minutes_ this episode passed but I was so exhausted the rest of the day and night. Had bad chills that night but they passed by the next morning. The diar,"My GYN did a bone scan which showed very low scores (osteopenia) and he then gave me a sample of Boniva to begin taking and a prescription for same.  I read the side effects and immediately sensed this was something I was not comfortable taking.  However_ after talking with my Gen Pract_ I decided to go ahead.  Even though so far_ my side effects have been somewhat tolerable_ it is clear by all of the postings on this site that each month can be different as to what kind of side effects can occur.  The biggest question I have is ""does this stuff work?""  Who out there has been on this and has had a follow-up bone scan to determine if you have built up enough bone mass to possibly discontinue Boniva?

1080, 1, Osteoporosis,I have been on BONIVA for almost 18 months.  After I took my first pill I had chills and shaking so bad I had to stay in bed for 3 days. I did not make the BONIVA connection. Second pill I had chills for 2 days and still did not make the connection.  Since taking BONIVA I have had aches in all my joints - EVEY SINGLE ONE - all knuckles_ elbows_ knees_ ankles_ neck and on and on. Now over a year later - the past 3 months I have been in Excruciating pain. It is hard to describe pain in the bones_ but it is a sharp attack of pain that vibrates from my hip to my feet and back up to my hip. I STILL did not make the BONIVA connection. WHY? Because I was told that since I started menopause at 38 and have a good ten years on bone thinning that I needed this medication and the side effects were clearly listed on the disclaimer that came with the meds. So because of the pain two weeks ago I had to be tested for Rheumatoid arthritis_ Lupus_ and all matter of immune deficiency syndromes because of,"No medication is worth side effects. I am an otherwise healthy person. I exercise_ eat right. I prefer the holistic approach to health care. But I have ""osteoporosis."" I believed all the hype and I believed my doctors.

Just as I was beginning to feel better it was time for the next Boniva pill (10-24).  The extreme knee_ shoulder and ankle pain began again and a friend to whom I had described my symptoms advised me to check this site.

No way oj after reading the coments on this web site.  She has no pain anywhere and I'm not about to allow him to put this poison in her body.  When I asked him about the possible side effects_ he minimalized them to the extreme.  What is this - are the doctors getting some kind of kickback from the drug companies?  She had a severe adverse reaction some months ago from an antibiotic called Levaquin and although all of her pains were listed as possible side effects from this drug - her doctor would absolutely not even acknowledge that possibility.

1144, 1, osteoporosis,I had purged my med list of all meds with back pain as a side effect and had been feeling great.  New doctor concerned about my osteoporosis and height loss suggested Boniva.  Tried monthly oral for 2 months.  Due to reflux issues he suggested the IV.  April 2007 first IV.  Niggling back pain started so I started seeing a Chiropractor but no real relief for mild to moderate pain.  On the 2nd of July I had my second IV.  That evening back muscle pain started ratcheting up and by the 4th of July I was in severe muscle spasms.  Flexeril & ibuprofen gave minor relief.  A chiropractor specializing in soft tissue treatment (+ flexeril & ibuprofen) gave short periods of relief. Slowly the back pain is subsiding after 9 weeks.  I have also had pain in the arches of my feet and charley-horses in calves.  Dr. doesn't think that this was caused by Boniva and that symptoms are coincidental.  I felt great until I started Boniva.  I do not intend to take that risk again as I have been barely,I am afraid that we are victims of advertising drugs that are not really the miracle cures that are portrayed to us.  The only miracle cure is in the pocketbook of the drug companies.,F,63,7  months,9/5/2007,Boniva

I was diagnosed with Osteopenia two years ago and started taking Fosamax. I took Fosamax for 1 year_ when I learned about Boniva from TV advertising. At my next annual checkup_ I asked my gynecologist for Boniva instead of Fosamax because the dosing appealed to me. I have been taking Boniva for 1 year_ and have just had my second bone scan. My gynecologist told me that I have regained some bone density_ and he told me to continue taking the Boniva. For 4 or 5 months prior to my exam_ I have been experiencing really sore neck_ shoulder_ and back pain. Aching and stiffness that just won't go away and lasts for a few weeks. I feel like an old lady . The aching almost goes away before taking my next month's dose.  The pain goes on_ but I've been ignoring it_ chalking it up to getting older_ and not ever connecting it to possible side effects of the drug. I didn't even complain to my physician!

I was literally crippled for several days after taking the Boniva.

However_ my Dr convinced me to try it once more_ and everything was fine this time. So_ those of you who had a bad first experience_ try it again - it might just be OK.  Also_ I think that getting lots of calcium in my diet (not supplements - milk and yogurt) helps. I feel stronger than before.,This is a strong drug_ and one should expect side effects. But theh option for me (being crippled with fractures) is not acceptable.

1152, 1, Osteopenia,On day following the initial monthly dose_ I experienced severe back pain.  I attributed it to sleeping in a bad position. I had never experienced muscle spasms (mid-thoracic) where I could barely stand or function. Following high-dose antiinflammatories_ the back pain is better. Now I'm experiencing leg cramping and myalgias limiting normal exericise. The flu-like malaise_ profound fatigue and lack of energy led me to look at the side effects of this drug.  At this point_ I see no reason to take the medication next month.  I'm eager for my system to clear of the drug so that I might resume normal life.  Additionally_ my normal cheery personality is blunted significantly.,Our doctors do not know enough about the horrible side effects of this medication.

1190, 4, osteopenia,I took it for 18 months (150 mg once a month)and had improvement in my last bone density test after 9 months.  However_ during this second year_ I noticed pain in my cocyx and right hip and recently my acid reflux_ which has been under control with prilosec_ started acting up.  Fortunately I came to this website and read the other comments and thought what a fool I'd been.  No more Boniva for me.  I only wish I could get it out of my system immediately before it creates anymore problems.  Thanks folks for sharing your comments.  I realize my bones may suffer but at least I feel like I'm in control of my body and my bones!,,F,57,18  months,7/16/2007,Boniva
1191, 2, osteopenia,Well_ I tried both Actinol and Fosimax and within the first hour_ I thought I was having a heart attack (severe chest pain_) with both.  This was my 3rd month for Boniva and for the first 2 1/2 weeks after taking it_ I had the severe bone pain other people have described here. I felt like I was 100 years old--horrible. I am a generally VERY healthy and active person_ but I can't describe it any other way than to say every bone in my body hurt--especially hips and legs.  About 1-1/2 weeks ago I began feeling better and began exercising again--I am supposed to take it again tomorrow_ but my doctor says to go off of it.  I certainly don't want osteoporosis_ but I couldn't live like that for 2 weeks out of the month.  I take no other medication except calcium_ so I know it was not a drug interaction.  I can't really find much clinical data on these kind of side effects_ but it certainly seems to be something other folks are reporting on this forum.,I wish there was more data out there about the bone pain and potential long term effects.,F,51,90  days,7/16/2007,Boniva

1196, 1, Osteoporosis,I'm writing this for my mother who is 86 years old and was on her third dose of Boniva.  A few minutes after taking Boniva she felt extremely hot all over and broke into a sweat. Felt extremely weak_ could not see_ was disoriented. Fell on the floor and had violent bouts of vomiting. I found her on the floor_ got her to sit up against the wall and when the vomiting spasms abated I got her onto a chair. She could not walk and had strong pains in her left hip. I called  her Dr. and was told that  Boniva could not be the cause of it and that she should be taken to ER.  At the ER they put her on IV_ did EKG_  X-Rays of chest and of left hip and blood tests_ they did not show anything abnormal. Her heart rate was very irregular so they administered Diltiazem.  This steadied the heart rate and afer a few hours she was released with recommendation to see  her primary care phisician and get a cardiac ultrasound.  The ER doctor called the doctor who prescribed Boniva and was told that Boniva co,I also called the Boniva manufacturer and was told that they had never heard of such reaction. I suspected that they were not telling me the truth. So_ I got online and I came across this site. After reading the horror stories I'm convince that Roche Laboratories  is not telling all they know about the possible side effects of their drug. I'm going to take a print out of these stories to my mother's doctor and send one to the ER doctor.,F,86,3  days,7/12/2007,Boniva
1197, 3, Osteopenia,I hadn't noticed any unfavorable side effects thus far and was pleased.  The past month_ however_ I've had an upset stomach and bloated feeling_ sort chest/back muscles_ what feels like a pulled groin muscle or tendon_ stiff neck_ dizziness (and blacking out briefly when standing after bending over)_ and severe gastro reflux symptoms.  I do have GERD and am on medicine for it but it has been under control.  Now it is back even with the medicine and I feel like I have an elephant sitting on my chest and have swallowed a tennis ball that is lodged at the base of my throat.  My muscles ache and I am very stiff in the mornings and after sitting.,I don't know if any of this is really from Boniva.  I've taken it for over two years and would think any adverse reactions would have happened before this.  Could it take this long to cause reactions?  Is it just the normal changes that have to be expected with aging?  It didn't even dawn on me to associate my problems with Boniva at first.  I have a doctor appointment coming up and am going to discuss it.  I think it's worth stopping it to see if I feel better as all this is miserable and gets me down. How long would that take?  I found this site and am amazed at how much other's symptoms sound like mine.  I took Actonel weekly for a year or so before this and liked Boniva for the convenience.  They did stop my ostopenia progress and my bone density even improved a little.  It's a dilema.,F,60,2  years,7/11/2007,Boniva

I took my first 1 a month Boniva this past weekend and I spent 10 hours in the hospital on Tuesday 5/29. I have been in such pain it is incredible. Chest pain_ breathing issues maybe from so much pain. I have mild asthma and with the tremendous chest pain I was in I couldn't breathe in or out.  I thought I had somehow broken my ribs.  I left the hospital with no true diagnosis but with a it's probably Pleurisy but not really a sure diagnosis.  Now I am reading all of this and so much of what I am reading is how I have felt for 4 - 5 days now.  The pain has been spreading and I can't get comfortable.

Could not turn over in bed-because of pain. Even breathing was painful. The next day I had a strange pain in my foot and then my knee.  After two days I realized it was the Boniva.  Probably would not have figured it out so soon if it were not for this site. The severe pain lasted about a week but I still have some ongoing pains which may be because it's only been two weeks and the drug is still in my system.,I tried this because I ordinarily do not have much reaction to medications and thought i would might be one of the ones who would be able to tolerate it.--I didn't have any of the flu or diarrhea symptoms but the pains were intense.

Well_ Boniva  put a stop to it.  Last Christmas I was almost bedridden and stopped it.  My body has been racked with pain now for 5 months and there is no way to flush it out. It has to run its course.  Pains and aches are lessening now and swelling is less too but all the problems have not ceased.  I hope no one experiences what I have...ever...ever.

I still have mild to moderate nausea_ and stomach pain.  The worst problem is severe back pain.  It appears to be muscle pain.  I cannot get comfortable sitting_ standing or lying down.   It began at the onset of the flu symptoms in my lower back and has progressed up to just below my shoulder blades and within the last several hours has begun to progress around my sides.  Heat_ cold_ Naproxin (Alieve?)_ acetaminophen don't relieve it.   When I make the mistake of doing something that requires my major back muscles the pain is excruciating.

The doctor states that my pain is being caused by the nerve endings_ not painful muscles as I thought.  I have found that by putting a wet hand towel in the microwave for 1 minute and then applying it FIRMLY around my joints_ I get some relief.  Heating pad with moist heat helps the back and hip area.  Putting pressure by wrapping the heating pad and/or hot towel seems to feel very good on my joints.  Doctor said to continue with tylenol and to keep my body moving even though it is painful.  To sit still and not move can cause damage to muscles from lack of use.  So I am trying to slowly walk through the house_ careful not to trip.  My daughter got me a cane!!

I'm not sorry I took it because I now know it's not for me. Since I stopped the Boniva (took last one Mar 1)_ the pain has disappeared which I feel is due in part to a good program of weight bearing exercises. I follow a very healthy diet. Lots of fresh fruits & veggies_ and very little processed foods_ which I feel helped me to heal my gut. My mood is also back to normal. If you can take this drug_ great. Boniva was NOT good for me. Also_ know you have choices and take responsibility for your body. Do research on the best calcium to take for maximum absorption. Most Dr's don't know squat about this.

Arms_ neck_ elbows_ hips_ and backbone were in much pain. Almost fainted twice while teaching.  Found this website and realized that my condition was due to the Boniva. Now 7 weeks after the second pill_ I still have numbness in my hip_ pain moves around_ primarily still in elbows_ left hip_ and neck.  This has been a very debilitating and tiring 3 months so far.

1299, 5, osteoporosis,None whatsoever!,I was shocked to read all of these horrible problems experienced while taking Boniva! I took Fosomax for almost two years and then started taking Boniva. I took  it for another nine months and had a bone density test_ which indicated that the meds  have helped me move from the Osteoporitic ranges of T  scores to the Osteopeneic ranges......great results! I have not had the first side effect and feel as though these meds have helped me beat the odds against a disease that has crippled previous generations of my family members. If you are considering taking either Fosomax or Boniva_ please try it before making a decision based upon others' experiences.

1321, 2, Osteoporosis (have breast  cancer),I have very bad leg pain - thighs_ hips_ knees. After sitting for a while_ I can hardly walk when I get up. I'm 46 and feel like I'm 90. Sometimes feel like my knees are going to give out from under me. I took Boniva for 4 months (4 pills). I will not take it again and will give this a 3 month trial. If the pain goes away_ we'll know it's the Boniva. (Not 100% sure because I also take Tamoxifen for breast cancer.),,F,46,4  months,2/18/2007Email,Boniva
1322, 2, Osteopenia,I took one dose of Boniva early AM as prescribed.  By early afternoon_ I experienced a sharp chest pain that felt heart related (it was slightly left of midline sterum and directly over heart).  I had no shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.  After a couple of hours of continuing discomfort_ I took two aspirin which actually seemed to help.  At the time_ I associated the pain with false angina due to spasms of the chest muscle_ possibly from exercise.  When a friend described the same symptoms from Fosomax_ I decided the coincidence of experiencing chest pain with my first dose of Boniva should not be ignored.,,F,62,1  weeks,2/17/2007,Boniva

I take the pill about 5:30 am_ walk for 1 hr_ no side effects to really mention_ other than the 1st day is always a little headache but goes away.  I find that walking right after taking Boniva will help the drug get into the intestine quicker without feeling nausea_ or upper digestive disorders.  I will be re-checked in another few mths to see my status.  Walking_ weight training is also a PLUS to strengthen any person's bones. Sometimes I do feel some bone pain about my neck and shoulders but only when I have failed to go the gym on a regular program.,It's also so convenient to only take this pill once a month and I will say I am not a pill taker_ but this one is a must....,F,58,16  months,1/13/2007Email,Boniva

I will do exercises she prescribed_ but after reading this web site_ I will not take another Boniva as I feel there's no other reason for my pain.,Why aren't patients given all the facts? After reading about the small advantage for taking this versus the side effects_ I would have stuck with calcium and vitamin D. I hope this pain will start to subside and not last long.

My gynecologist told me in September that I HAVE to start a bone supplement after my 2nd bone density test. She recommended Boniva because it was just once a month.  At first I thought my aches & pains were just age related. I even saw my PCP who put me on prednisone for 8 days thinking it was a pinched nerve causing my pain.  All my aches and pains started within a week after taking my first dose. I started to think my problems were caused by the Boniva after my 2nd dose. I pulled up patient info from the manufacturer which did list the problems I am having minus the fluid retention. I started to search further for side effects and came across this site.

1356, 3, Osteoporosis,I took my first dose of Boniva exactly as I was supposed to_ at 7 AM. That night_ I went to sleep and awoke about 3 AM to severe fever and chills. I was shivering intensely and could not catch my breath for a solid hour. For the next three days I had stomach and joint pain_ intermittent fever and chills and sweating_ and felt light headed. Four days later_ I still do not feel 100%--particularly my stomach.,I gave the drug a 3 because I cannot yet make a judgement about it. The first dose was horrible and cost me a day of work. My doctor told me that we'll have to wait and see how the second dose goes. The prospect of osteoporosis is pretty frightening to me_ so I will do my best to continue the medication and other than the stomach pain_ I have not experienced any bone pain and the joint pain has been akin to the kind of discomfort that accompanies a fever.,F,54,4  days,12/5/2006,Boniva
1357, 2, osteopenia moderate to severe,neck and back pain,I have taken only 1 dose of Boniva_ within 2 days I felt neck pain like I had whiplash_ I scheduled a massage_ after 2 weeks the pain migrated to my lower back_ I scheduled a chiropractor visit. I was afraid to go because I thought I had a fracture in my neck and back from doing nothing to cause one??? I actually was thinking the pain may be caused by the bones improving_ so I started looking this up and am finding this is a common side effect. The pain is improving and I am actually thinking about taking my second dose to see if this was all just coincidence with taking the medication_ because I really do need treatment and my mother had compression fractures and was in pain that I don't want to have.,F,45,1  months,12/5/2006,Boniva
1358, 1, osteoporosis,I took Boniva for the first time on Dec 1_ 2006. I was looking forward to it as I get bad esophageal effects from Actinel and Fosamax. About 24 hours after taking the first dose I started to get diarrhea. A few hours later I became chilled_ and was shaking so badly for several hours I could ot function_ despite layers of clothing_ about 80 degree room and a down comforter. My fingers and toes became frighteningly numb and I thought I would have to go to the emergency room.,I had limb pain and was so weak I took sleeping pills to knock me out. The following day I am mostly recovered_ but will never take Boniva again. It is hard for me to understand that they could get away with marketing a drug with such severe potential side-effects.,M,54,1  months,12/4/2006Email,Boniva
1359, 2, osteopenia,No problem the first day.  Second day I awoke with pain in lower spine and right hip joint.  I have a high tolerance for pain_ but this deep bone pain was significant.  Today_ the third day I again awoke with the spine and hip joint pain_ so I took naproxen sodium_ and was doing better until about 3 or 4PM.  Then I started to get pain in my sternum (breast bone).  I was not concerned about it possibly being heart-related because it felt like bone pain rather than tissue pain.,"I will definitely discuss these symptoms with my doctor on my follow-up visit in a few weeks.  After having read the experiences and comments of others_ I will ask my doctor to visit this site before prescribing Boniva to anyone else.  I will not take Boniva again_ and I seriously doubt I'll take any of the others.  My doctor told me the ""half-life"" of Fosamax is 10 years!  He suggested Boniva because he read it is ""only"" 5!",F,54,3  days,12/3/2006Email,Boniva

1363, 1, osteopenia,I had a heart attack resulting from a coronary artery spasm after my second dose of Boniva. The doctors were totally floored. I am so healthy that it made absolutely no sense. They were unable to find any damage or plaque in my arteries in the angiogram. My cholesterol is 120 and my HDL is 75.I also walk 6 miles a day_don't smoke and eat a good diet and am a perfect weight.  Low risk for heart attack.My bone density was not that bad_I am so angry that I took the drug.   ,I found other articles on line and in this blog about others who have had  heart attacks or chest pain while taking Boniva.The problem is that I thought I was having indigestion and if I didn't go into the doctor I would never have known that I had a heart attack because the coronary artery in spasm eventually released itself . The blood tests confirmed that I did have a mychardial infraction and I was hospitalized for 4 days.  I wonder if any other women experiencing chest pain or digestive problems are possibly having coronary spasms without knowing it.  The side effects do say chest pain_ but what do they mean by it?. The whole thing is pretty scary. I will never take Boniva again.,F,54,2  months,12/2/2006Email,Boniva

1371, 2, osteopenia,Started taking Fosamax several years ago.  Switched to Boniva because it is once a month.  Never really thought that all of my aches and pains could be caused from this but my Mom mentioned to me how bad Fosamax was and now I am wondering.  When I first started taking Fos I had severe hip pain to the point of going to a specialist.  After xrays etc. couldn't find anything wrong.  However_ the pain was so severe I couldn't sleep and could hardly walk.  After about a year that pain just went away.  Then I had elbow pain and figured it was from using the computer.  It was also severe.  Now that has gone away.  For the last 3 months I have had severe neck and shoulder pain to the point that I take 3-4 Advil a day and it still hurts.  Now_ today I have a pain in my ribcage so I start freaking out.  I have been blaming all of this on getting old and maybe that's not it at all.  I'm so tired of feeling pain in so many of my joints.  After reading this site now I am scared to death.,I think I will go off the Boniva.  I already take the calcium and D.

I took it following directions very closely (no sitting 1 hour after_ drinking plenty of water_ etc.).  I felt horrible.  My bones and joints ached so bad_ it was hard to move around and I even cried at times because it was so debilitating.  I am not the type of person to buckle with pain so this is tremendous that a medication can do this to me.  After the first month_ I tried again and the same thing happened.  I am not on Boniva any longer.  I am taking calcium vitamins 3x a day and counting on that and excercise as the right remedy which is proven to work and be safe. Our bodies don't absorb calcium correctly and that is why we have this problem to start.  Correcting the problem with proper nutrition does not hurt your other organs or cause the tremendous side effects associated with this drug and so many others.

Definitely bloated through the mid-section.,At first I did not associate all of these aches and pains with Boniva.  I have been having some sciatica problems and just thought that the hip and leg aches were associated with tight muscles_ however no amount of stretching is helping_ pt didn't help and the chiropractor has been only midly helpful.  I didn't understand the neck_ hand and arm pains_ but after going to this site_ I'm finished with this drug.  I did call my doctor about the shoulder and neck pain and told her I didn't want to take Boniva any longer.  This was three months ago.  She is insistent_ but I've never even had a bone density scan.  I walk_ swim and do free weights.  Those things along with extra calcium with D will be my regimen.  I just hope all of these other symptoms go away after I discontinue use of Boniva.  I didn't know that any of these other symptoms were associated with this drug.

1375, 1, osteopenia,Several days after taking my first dose of Boniva I had flu like symtoms (sluggish & skin sensitive to the touch) and started getting severe pain in many joints and muscles. The pain moved throughout the body_ but especially in the neck_ knees_ hands and hips. It would hurt in different areas at different times. My finger joints and right knee were so swollen I could not close my hand or bend my knee. The base of my neck hurt so badly I could hardly turn it. Depression and Fatigue were incapacitating.,"30 days after taking my first dose of Boniva I had a spinal cord ""event"".  I got up one morning and could barely walk.  I entered the hospital thru the Emergency Room with tingly and numb legs (felt like they were asleep).  They were very painful.

Toward the end of the first month I started having severe pains in my left ribs front and back which cut my breath off. Right after taking the second dose I awoke one morning with such severe pain in my left arm and shoulder I could not use it. Still having the pain in my ribs_ I was pretty useless. After a day or so this felt better but I  started itching on the same arm an shoulder. Found a large red area on my left arm and shoulder with rash that was very uncomfortable. This lasted a week or more. I did not take the third dose and am improving though I still have pain in my ribs when I cough. Noticed bloating and tightness in my clothing.

He X-rayed my ankle and there is no boken bones. I did'nt realize at first it could be related to Boniva.  I am now in a cast up to my knee and am in excruciating pain.  My ankle and toes are red and swollen.  I am going back today 9-19-2006 and am going to tell the Ortho about Boniva.  I am not taking it again and only hope this problem goes away.,I am going to stop taking Boniva.,F,68,2  months,9/18/2006Email,Boniva
1402, 1, Osteoporosis,Since my last posting and my last once-a-month pill (July 5_ 2006) I am experiencing a heaviness in my jaws_ muscle tingling and fatigue in my hands and arms. The spasms in my feet have very much decreased. The gastric problems have been greatly helped by these products: Rhizinate_ Mastica_ and PhytoZyme. Whereas I had to sleep propped up by 2 pillows_ now it's just a little camp pillow under my own. I'm concerned about how my muscles and jaw feel. Perna Plus seems to help. Look these products up. They are natural and have helped. Read The Myth of Osteoporosis by Gillian Sanson.,I further agree with the person(s)who believe that we are experiencing an ALLERGIC reaction to bisphosphonates. I tried benadryl one night on an impulse and it seemed to relieve some of these side effects_ supporting my suspicion that I'm allergic to the toxic boniva.,F,55,10  months,9/15/2006Email,Boniva

I also ran a fever several hours after taking the first pill. Only recently did the bone pain begin. I have since stopped taking Boniva and am still enduring the pain in my bones and joints.

1404, 1, osteoporosis,I experienced severe chest pains which spread throughout my body by the end of the day after I took my initial dose. I also was feverish_ fatigued and had chills.,The day aftr taking my first dose I woke up with severe chest pains - like I had been hit hard.  The pain worsened and spread throughout my entire body.  I could hardly move (thankfully still had a few vicotin left over from a car accident a few months earlier).  By mid-day I was running a fever and could do nothing by lay down.  The symptoms were better the next day_ but it was 3 days before I could return to work.  Although by the end of the week most of the pain was gone_ I still felt weak and tired.

1405, 1, osteopenia/post-hysterectomy menop.,Numerous adverse side-effects: the worst has been excruciating lower back pain which literally immobilizes me particularly when I get out of bed in the AM.  Other bone/joint pains_too.One month I had debilitating flu-like symptoms for 4 days and 2 other months I've felt as if I have a cold for 2-3 days; frequent mild/moderate headaches;  bloated feeling and distended stomach area; eye redness w/light sensitivity; waking upseveral times at night.,"With some skepticism after reading ""official"" boniva information_ I nevertheless pressed on with enthusiasm as my doctor told me it was a must after having had a total hysterectomy to eradicate uterine cancer. He was already treating me for osteopenia and said this would bring on sudden menopause and certain rapid increase of bone loss. After the 2nd month_ I spoke to his nurse who consulted with him. She informed me that my symptoms were minimal and many of his patients were on Boniva with little or no problems. I was encouraged to continue. I did_ but not with blind faith.  I have more carefully tracked symptoms and physical reactions that I have never had or in the case of headaches_ seldom have.  The continuing excruciating back pain is the (physical) catalyst along with more information I have learned since I began taking it on 5/2/06.

Interestingly_ I am getting notices from the pharmacy as to why I'm not taking my monthly Boniva_ and when I asked them_ they said that they ha an agreement with Roche and Glaxo Smith Kline to send the monthly letters.

I am normally very healthy - work fulltime outside the home.  My doctor prescribed it as an alternative to Actonel_ which caused severe flu-like symptoms and neck and head pain. Frankly I felt fine before I started either pill.,Just took my second once-monthly tablet two days ago -- symptoms worsened this month. starting by the evening of the day I took the pill that morning.

It hurts even to breath or bend_ or turning etc. Never had any such pain in my life. This in not cardiac pain. It is the bone pain. Although_ I never took any non-narcotic pain meds before_ I had to take them to function. But they did not help much. Today is the 4th day after taking the first Boniva and there is no sign of pain going away. Do not know how long this last! Obviously_ I am not going to take the Boniva next month when it becomes due for the once a month dose.,The Boniva package insert does not say anything about Sternal or other bone pains. However_they combined the pains into musculoskeletal and back pain. But_ the table in their package insert shows very minimal difference regarding the pains between the boniva takers and placebo. Furthermore_ according to their literature_ only about 2% increase (betterment) in femoral-neck bone mineral density (BMD) after 2 years (24 months) use of Boniva compared to placebo.That % is so small!!!! Perhaps one can get a much better percentage increase in BMD by taking the daily Calcium_Vit D +/-estrogen (for females) without going through this hell of a sternal & upper back etc._ pains. I am not going to take Boniva and I do not recommend it to others for the reasons stated above.,M,,1  months,9/7/2006Email,Boniva

1441, 1, Osteoporosis,I've been taking Boniva for 10 months. Before that_ Fosamax. On Fosamax_ I began to bloat_ gain weight_ have headaches. I switched to Boniva thinking less side effects as taking it once per month. However_ as time goes by on Boniva my stomach is extended_ gastric problems increase and more so lately_ more dramatically...more gastric reflux_ burning throat_ burning tongue_ burning from top (mouth) to bottom and I mean bottom_ trouble swallowing feeling like something is stuck in my throat_ aches in right hip and spasms in toes on right foot. Immediatley after taking my last dosage I felt acid flow right up to the left side of my head and felt foggy and headachey_ and my tongue burned. I also developed cold sores.,My chemistry is apparently way off. I've been to chiropractors due to hip pain_ had MRI (no observable reason for hip pain)_ and physical therapists. Taking apple cider vinegar helps the acid reflux but I'm finally going off Boniva. I've expercised all along and will continue. Tried alternative methods before Fosamax and didn't make gains like I did on Fosamax. So_ what to do next??? OH YES: I heard that Boniva has a real bad rebound. That's scarey! I'm going to another alternative practitioner and will see what he says.,F,55,10  months,7/18/2006Email,Boniva

The doctors there did not know of Boniva and resorted to looking it up on the computer.  Although they told me the x-ray did not show any damage_ they thought I should cease taking the drug.  My primary physician stated that the x-ray showed bursitis (never had this before!).  The pain subsided the following day.  I am still on the drug and each month I notice bloating_ mild nausea_ fatigue and overall aching in my bones.

How long does this take to wear off? I am 52 feeling like 90 years old. I was very healthy and active with no medical problems.  This should be take off the market.  Please e-mail flyinbl@hotmail.com if anyone knows how long it takes to get out of body system or what I can do to speed it up getting it out of my system. Thanks,One pill which caused me to become a cripple.  I thought I got some strange muscle disease then I realized it was the Boniva,F,52,1  months,4/15/2006Email,Boniva
1492, 1, osteoporosis,I previously had been on Fosamax for about 3 yrs..  I had to stop Fosamax because I was having severe indigestion and chest pain. I took Boniva twice.  The first time was in October. I took it as directed_ however I will say that I broke the pill trying to get it out of the package. The packaging is difficult.  I felt fine when I took the broken pill early in the morning_ by noon time I was feeling sick_ flu like. I was sick the next day and sicker the next.  I went to see my doctor_ she did blood work and told me to go directly to the emergency room at our local hospital.  My white blood count was three times normal.  I spent 8 hours in the emergency room where they determined that I had Pneumonia.  Once I was given antibiotice I started to feel better but it took me a good three weeks to get feeling right again.  Was this a coincidence? Maybe. After that I developed a severe pain in my elbow and shoulder and have been getting therapy for it.  Coincidence? Maybe.  I took Boniva again,,F,57,2  months,4/13/2006Email,Boniva
1493, 1, osteoporosis,severe back and chest pain_ stomach cramps_ weakness and lethargy_ skin rash_ flu-like symptoms for 3 days,I feel like Job from the Bible...every day for 6 days since taking my first dose of Boniva I've had horrific and new side effects. 24 hours after taking Boniva_ I had excrutiating pain in my upper back_ chest_ and shoulders. Following that_ uncontrollable chills and sweating. Then_ leg cramping and an itchy rash across my hips_ stomach_ and back. On day 3_ I experienced more flu-like symptoms_ headache_ and nausea. Days 4 & 5 have been excrutiating with severe pain in my abdomen and the rash spreading to my legs. I can't believe one pill has had such a devastating effect on a healthy and active person such as myself. Until taking my first dose of Boniva_ I was running 3 miles a day. On day 6_ I am still unable to walk around the block. I just wish I had seen this website and heeded the warnings before taking this medication.,F,52,1  months,4/7/2006,Boniva
1494, 1, Bone scan showed bone thinning,"On the 4th day after taking my first dose of Boniva I started getting unusual pain in every joint of my body.  Even my toe and finger joints hurt.  My entire body had that ""tingly"" feeling you get just before a bad cold sets in. My neck hurts so badly I can barely turn.  I have also slept more in the past two days than I usually do in a full week. I actually feel asleep at my PC in the office yesterday.",I was relieved to find information on the internet from others who have experienced the same symptions I am feeling. I do not plan to continue taking Boniva or any Osteoporosis medication.  I will increase my exercising and revamp my diet to insure I do all I can without medications.,F,53,4  days,4/6/2006Email,Boniva
1495, 1, osteoporosis,Pelvic pain_ abdominal cramps_ extremely tired_ headache.,Doctors should provide better warning on potential side effects. Thankfully_ I only took one dose and began experiencing side effects 48 hours later. Will not take again. I'm on my 4th day of side effects and wonder how much longer?,F,56,6  days,4/4/2006,Boniva
1496, 5, osteopenia,Ive had NO side-effects from Boniva.,I had previously taken Actonel for 1 year and suffered the side-effects of back pain and leg pain.  Boniva has been a blessing for me!,F,52,4  months,4/2/2006,Boniva
1497, 1, osteopenia,Flu like symptoms appx 24 hours aftertaking.  General ill feeling.  Stomach cramps and then aching.  Leg and back pain.  Tired all day.  Even my eyes and teeth hurt!  It's been 1 week since taking the pill and I still feel awful.,Took the once a month pill.  Will NEVER take it again.,F,58,1  months,3/31/2006,Boniva
1498, 1, osteopina,I have been on boniva 1 week.  I became a cripple.  I could not walk up steps_ get out of the car and had severe pain in my legs_ knees and ribs.  I felt like all my bones were broken.  Last year I broke my foot and didn't feel half as bad as I do now.  I bope this wears off soon and I will never take it again.  I'll stick to walking and otc calcium with vitamin d.,,F,52,7  days,3/31/2006,Boniva

1500, 1, osteoporosis,Unusual pain in joints and neck; headache; foggy feeling in head;upset stomach; difficulty in swallowing; extreme fatigue; strange pain in forehead; metalic taste in mouth.,I took Actonel before starting Boniva and had some of the same side effects_ but not as severe. I work out 4 times a week_ bike_ and hike regularly and had plenty of energy until I started taking Boniva. Now I'm extremely tired and have flu-like symptoms on most days. I took Boniva for 4 months but will not take it again.,F,63,4  months,3/28/2006,Boniva
1501, 1, Bone density test came back bad,Excrutiating pain in the joints and muscles that moved throughout the body. It would hurt in different areas at different times. It got so bad couldn't even walk at times. Chest pain_ heartburn_ trouble swallowing_ cold sores_ upset stomach. No pain medication would help.,I am writing this about my father a healthy_ still working 73 year old up until he took his second dose of Boniva in August of 2005. He was in and out of the hospital and emergency rooms so many times I couldn't keep track. He had all kinds of tests and nothing showed up. He was on so much pain medication and nothing would help. He couldn't sleep_ eat sit or lay. He was diagnosed with mutiple myloma late September. This was also the wrong diagnosis. He was then diagnosed with acute leukemia which is what he died from October 29_ 2005. I don't know if the Boniva caused this or if it just brought this disease out. As I said my father was healthy and working before Boniva and he also had regular check ups. I have never seen anyone in such pain! I asked the doctors from the beginning if the Boniva could have caused this and they wouldn't even talk about it. No one can make me believe that Boniva didn't have something to do with my father's death.,M,73,2  months,3/26/2006Email,Boniva
1502, 3, Counter for Arimidex (thins bone),After taking Fosamax for 4 months which made me feel crippled_ Dr put me on Boniva.  Need something to counteract the Arimidex (BC medicine) which thins the bones.  Third month on Boniva and starting to feel like WW3 is going on in my bones.  Deep bone aches_ especially in the thighs and lower back_ difficulty getting into an upright position_ and sometimes feel like one or the other of my legs isn't going to hold me.  Figure I'll see if the affects let up before it's time to take another.  May only try this one once more.,I'm continuing to walk quickly for about 15 minutes_ twice a day_ in spite of the aches.  At my age_ am concerned about osteoporosis_ and with the cancer medicine thinning the bones_ really need to have something to help keep them strong.  Doubt that calcium and vitamin D can do it on their own_ so will continue to try to find one of these meds that doesn't make me feel like a cripple.,F,64,3  months,3/22/2006Email,Boniva
1503, 1, osteopenia,The first dosage knocked me to the ground with severe_ intense flu-like symptoms of gastric distress_ muscle & bone pain_ and insomnia. I stayed in bed for two days but had to drag myself out to start a new job on the 3rd day. Horrible!! The misery of that day was nightmarish: bones in collar bones/chest aching so I could not breathe or sit up straight_ tired from not sleeping_ head foggy from pain and lack of sleep...it's a wonder I kept the job.,I've taken three more dosages_ without the intense symptoms as the first time_ and thought maybe it would be ok. But then I began to notice aches and pains I never had before in legs and joints. In addition I've experienced tremendous fatigue which I initially blamed on the new job_ but now think is related to Boniva. I'm waiting to see if not taking it this month will make a difference_ but I will not take it again. I hate it. HATE IT. Thanks for this site!,F,57,4  months,3/19/2006Email,Boniva
1504, 1, osteoporosis,Very achy all over_ especially in legs and lower back.  Flu like symptoms with chills and a strange feeling in my head.  Felt just awful.  Have taken the pill twice.  Symptoms lasted two days each time_ and then I feel fine.  First tried Actonel_ but experienced same symptoms_ but also had gastrointestinal discomfort with the Actonel.,Do not think that it will be worth it to continue to take this medication.,F,57,2  months,3/15/2006Email,Boniva
1505, 1, Osteoporosis,Leg Pain and Joint Pain in my legs_ especially the calves.  My right leg feels like it will give way on me when I turn a certain way.  I felt great before taking Boniva_ my Doctor thought my bones could use this medicine.  I think not.,I've only taken one dose on the 9th of March. 2006 and already on the 13th and 14th_ I've begun to have terrible leg pains.  I was just fine before my bone scan last week.  I can't believe that this is happening to me.  I will continue with my exercises and my calcium and Vit.D. I'll call my Doctor before I discontinue taking the medicine.,F,63,1  months,3/14/2006Email,Boniva
1506, 1, Osteoporosis,Unrelenting muscle spasms in mid-back and hips; neck too painful and stiff to turn; stiff knees; site of arthritis at base of thumb swollen double_ rendering hand too painful to use; back pain too bad to sleep; like labor only more so; terrible headache,I first took the monthly tablet at the last of January. Although I had side effects_ I did not tie them to Boniva until I took the second dose on March 1. Then I suffered a much worse reaction. I went to my family doctor after two days_ having realized that both attacks followed in the afternoon of the morning I took Boniva. The doctor tested blood and urine and took a history to determine if there were another cause_ such as moving furniture or breaking bones. I will not take Boniva again. I am taking calcium citrate with each meal and walking two miles a day to build up my bones. From looking at the Fosamax comments_ I am afraid of taking it too as it seems to produce the same unacceptable side effects. Thank you for providing a site where we can find the truth.,F,69,2  days,3/12/2006,Boniva
1507, 1, osteoperosis and osteopenia,Gastic upset_ heartburn_ abdominal cramps_ chest pain_ fatigue_ black spots before my eyes_ light headedness_ and generally feeling very sick.,Symptoms started about 24 hours after taking the Boniva once a month pill. Abdominal distress continues 1 week after taking the pill.  I would not recommend anyone taking this pill. I have not yet felt the joint pain other describes_ and I hope I don't get any. I will not take another pill_ and instead I will try to prevent further bone loss with calcium and vitamin D.  I am afraid the symptoms will continue as this is a time-released medication.,F,60,7  days,3/11/2006,Boniva
1508, 1, Osteoporosis and osteopenia,The first time I took Boniva (at the beginning of Feb.) I experienced shooting leg and arm pains for an 8-hour period the following evening.  The second time  I took it I had violent flu-like symptoms for a 12-hour period the next evening - ice-cold hands and feet; excruciating_ unrelenting chills_ tremors_ and spasms; severe aches and pains that  encompassed not just my arms and legs but my whole body; fever and intense sweats.  The next morning I was so drained and debilitated from the episode that I started to faint in the shower as I prepared to go to work.  Needless to say_ the fainting spell made me even sicker and I spent the day in bed trying to recover.  This was a horrible experience for me_ particularly because I am in good physical condition and began to take the medication on the advice of my doctor after a bone density test and not because of any physical problems.,The side effects in the package insert do say that mild flu-like symptoms may occur after the first dose but should diminish or disappear following the first administration.  In my case_ the second dose exacerbated the side effect.  Obviously_ my body reacted violently to it. I will not take any more of this medication and believe that it should be taken off the market.  At the present time I plan to conduct extensive research on the other medications that drug companies claim will renew or build up bone density.  If I do try another drug in this class_ I will take a daily dose rather than a weekly one (certainly not a monthly one) so that the reaction will_ presumably_ be less violent_ and if I need to discontinue the drug_ I will not have such a high level of the toxin in my system.  And_ I may just continue to rely on calcium pills and weight-bearing exercise.  Perhaps we need to change our view of osteoporosis and look at it as a natural concommitant of aging rather than a disease.,F,67,2  months,3/9/2006Email,Boniva

1511, 1, osteopenia,Debilitating leg pain and foot pain--hobbled around like a 90 year old woman_ and could barely make it up the steps.  The pain was even there when I was sitting with my legs elevated.  I didn't associate it at first with the Boniva_ until I mentioned the pain to my gyn and HE mentioned the link_ since I had started the Boniva several months previously. Apparently_ he has heard this from plenty of other patients to immediately make that link.  As soon as he said it_ I realized that was the ONLY thing that had changed.  I have been off the stuff for two months now_ and am feeling much better.  I'll take the osteoporosis before I go on this again.,,F,47,4  months,3/5/2006,Boniva
1512, 1, osteopenia,I was originally on Fosamax and always experienced back and leg pain--but attributed it to my age. Then_ last March I had to have back surgery because of a disc problem--the surgery was very successful.  At that time I changed to Boniva and still experienced terrible back & leg pains.  But then I thought it was still the after-effect of the surgery.  Recently went for MRI and there was nothing abnormal.  Finally_ I decided on my own to check the Fosamax and Boniva sites and was AMAZED at the number of people who are experiencing the same symptons that I have.  I have always been very active and this whole thing has been very depressing to me.,I just took a Boniva tablet 3 days ago and cannot believe how uncomfortable I am.  I can barely walk without experiencing an awful amount of pain.  I do not plan to take another one and hope that the pain will go away or at least get better.  I can't believe that one pill can cause such harm.  Maybe it does work for some people_ but I wish there were some way of testing for those at risk.  I just want to go back to normal and hope that Calcium and D will do the trick.,F,68,1  days,3/4/2006Email,Boniva

I took another pill on November 30_ 2005. The pain got worse_ but in the legs only.  By mid December my legs were swollen_ the pain was worse from the knee down.  That has continued.  I have not taken any more pills.  My doctor has run several tests_ done blood work_ and cannot find the cause of the swelling.,I will never take another one.,F,78,2  months,2/21/2006Email,Boniva
1514, 1, diagosed with osteoporosis,Unexplainable pain in several different parts of my body. Funny taste in my mouth. Fatigue I never had before. Depression,Boniva is also marketed in Europe under the name Bondronat for cancer-related bone complications. Please check out this wonderful website --www.mercola.com/2003/jun/7/boniva.htm Please read the whole article to the end.Underreporting of pain is probably considerable because of its subjective nature and because physicians attribute pain to other medical problems.

Depression_crying for no reason at all.Did not feel like myself anymore.,I told my doctor of these symptoms and he had me take a CT scan of my abdomen and pelvis and an ultrasound. Nothing diffinative was found and he then told me to go to a gastrointerologist.I was getting worse and worse. I was always very healthy and energetic.When I looked back over the last months the only new thing I was doing was taking this drug.I went online and started researching BONIVA.Then I read what others went through on Fosamex and Actonal. I was shocked at how many people are suffering from side affects. I discussed this with my doctor whoperscribed it and he did NOT think it was the Boniva and even suggested I continue to take the drug for another 2 months!!!!Was he looking out for me or the drug company?I wonder if he would say this to his wife or sister suffering from these pains!?A lot of people are being diagnosed as having fibromylgia when it could very well be the affects of these drugs.The drug BONIVA is marketed under another name in europe and it is used to tre,F,55,7  months,1/31/2006,Boniva
1516, 1, osteoporosis,Joint/bone/muscle pain and limitation of motion in shoulder areas.,I took one 150mg (once-monthly dose) of Boniva on Oct. 3_ 2005 and about two weeks later began experiencing severe bone_ joint_ and muscle pain in both my shoulders. This occurred spontaneously_ without any trauma or injury. I didn't take any more Boniva_ but I still have the severe pain together with limitation of motion_ mostly in my left shoulder although I am right-handed. This has actually become worse instead of better_ and has migrated into my right collar bone area and neck.
