0, 3, Asthma,Have not been tking long enough to see any.  The taste left in your mouth after the inhaler is not that great - but all inhalers have this problem and I wouldn't say it's any better or worse than anything else.,If you want to treat Asthma without Long acting Beta drugs_ or without Steroids_ it's had to find meds.  This is one of them - actually very side-effect free (Cromelyn Sodium is actuall OTC in NasalCrom it's so side-effect free).It does not work as good as Advair (Which I was on) but I'm willing to deal with a little tighter chest to avoid the side effects of Advair.,M,30,1  weeks,11/6/2007,Intal
