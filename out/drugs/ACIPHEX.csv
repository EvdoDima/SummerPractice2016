I might try and drop the Aciphex to see if those things work fine without this drug as I'm not too keen of the side effects: constipation_ trouble falling asleep and trouble waking up in the morning_ complete apathy which includes no sex drive which is the main reason I want to get off this drug.,M,44,30  days20 1X D,1/27/2016Email,Aciphex

13, 4, Acid Reflux,Where do I start???,I have been on and off Aciphex for such a long time. I was put on it after having a scope done and they found a little sore in my esophagus. I never really had reflux much before taking this drug. When I have attempted to stop taking it I end up miserable!! I am going through this now. The Dr. didn't ok my refill because of the holiday I guess. I have been off completely now for 3 days. I have so much acid_ basically can't eat because EVERYTHING is making it worse. I have had diarrhea_ cramping. My left leg and foot plus my left arm and hand feels tingly. I have a dizzy head and slight headache. After searching for help online I stumbled on this posting. OMG! I am realizing that after reading all the posts that others have had horrible side effects. I am shocked! I have had irregular heartbeats for years. My previously thick hair is now thin. My skin is always dry_ my nails are brittle. I am always tired and feel like I have the flu. I have been to the Dr. with these symptoms for years. Never find a thing. Could it really be this drug??? I don't think he has ever considered the side effects of this drug and especially being on it for so long. I had one Dr. tell me I would have to be on it the rest of my life. Just like a diabetic has to be on a life long med. I just don't know how I will be able to get over these terrible withdrawal symptoms. But I can not go back on this medicine!! I am going back to the Dr. this week and give him the link to this website. Praying you all can,F,61,10  years20 MG 1X D,12/1/2013Email,Aciphex

16, 1, Hiatus hernia,I've experienced heart palpitations_ elevated liver enzymes_ swollen ankles_ feet_  and legs. Dry mouth_ joint pain_ weakened bones_ eye twitches_ and back pain.,Since being on this medicine_ my big concern is on my liver and weakened bones_ I've even had a broken wrist. Ive tried to get off of it_ however when I skip a dose it feels 10x worst.  When they put me on aciphex_ they also put me on calcium -vit D and magnesium.  I've been on a vitamin D 50_000 unit treatment for 8 wks_ twice already.  When I spoke to my doctor about how I feel when skipping a dose she said_ the pills work by blocking the pumps in your stomach_ naturally your stomach will then produce more pumps_ until finally your stomach has made thousands of pumps. When you stop taking them_ all pumps are working full force making the acid reflux unbearable. If they know all this why do they prescribe it in the first place? For me it's now finding something that will work or surgery. :(   My cousin was just diagnosed with the same hernia I have and they prescribed her aciphex_ I sent her this link. She said she was not going to be taking them.  For those of you with no side effects_ that's wonderful_ you're one of the lucky ones_ for those of us not so lucky_ please be cautious of what you are taking. These are very dangerous and like drugs_ can be very addicting.  When the heartburn starts up that bad your running looking for that little yellow pill.  I should've seen it before_ yellow for warning.  Please do not take this!!,F,43,8  months20 mg 1X D,8/7/2013Email,Aciphex
17, 3, severe acid reflux from opiates,Totally stopped the symptoms_ no noticeable side effects at first.  BUT...see comments.,Over the long term_ I lost about half my hair; and I have to supplement a number of vitamins and calcium_ because Aciphex blocks absorption.  Then my insurance stopped covering it; and since nothing else works for me at this point_ I began paying for it myself. Without insurance_ it's $365 for 30 pills and it keeps going up. Even worse -- after all these years of doctors telling me I had to take it to prevent throat cancer_ the New York Times just published an article about a study showing that PPI medication may CAUSE throat cancer.  The problem is_ once you're on it_ your body adjusts; and it's very difficult (impossible?) to get off. Meanwhile_ it's become less effective over time. I now have reflux even after taking it.  My doctor tells me to double the dose.  No way!  It's a slippery slope. My advice would be DON'T START.,F,67,8  years10-20 1X D,6/3/2013,Aciphex

23, 4, GERD & Barrett's Esophagus,Headaches daily_ some tremors in my hands and fingers_ loss of appetite.,I was taking Omezparole for about a week or so due to some acid reflux issues at the time_ which were still unclear to me then_ and developed a full body rash.  Afterwards_ I was diagnosed with GERD and Barrett's Esophagus and subscribed Aciphex.  I've been on it for almosty a week now along with Calcium with D3 supplements twice daily to hinder any early on-set Osteoperosis.  So far the acid reflux has been a lot better and still feel occasional chest pain if I've eated something really fatty_ but mostly the acid reflux symptoms have dissolved.  The only thing that worries me are the tremors I've had.  At first I thought it was just an old injury acting up (I injured my hand a couple of years ago and hurts every so often)_ but then it happened in the other hand.

24, 5, Barret's esophagus diagnosis.,None.,I highly advise anyone who has acid reflux more than 3 times per week to definitely talk to a good doctor about it.  I had reflux at least 3 times per day for many years.  I didn't realize how many bottles of Pepcid complete I had stashed everywhere.  Started with Rolaids many years ago_ went through Tagamet_ Zantac_ Pepcid_ then Pepcid complete before I consulted my doctor.  First_ my health plan insisted I try Prilosec.  That was four days of hell.  Fortunately_ my gastro's nurse called to see how I was doing on the Aciphex_ and I told her my dilemma.  What an angel!  She straightened that out immediately.  Aciphex has been a godsend for me.  I cannot believe the side effects some of the folks are reporting here_ as I have felt nothing but relief.  This past week_ due to something my wife read to me from the newspaper doctor column_ I took a break from Aciphex.  I didn't feel any side effects from doing that_ but my acid reflux was back in 3 days.  I went four more days_ and just kept taking temporary OTC stuff.  I am sick of that.  I should have talked to my own doctor first.,M,64,4  years20 mg 1X D,5/11/2012,Aciphex
25, 1, Chest Pains,Stomach pains_ chest pains_ anxiety_ fatigue_ headache_ erratic heart beat_ raised blood pressure_ dizziness_ nausea (even when taken with food)_ blurred vision.,"I was given a 9 day trial on 4/25 (three bottles of three pills) along with a 6 day trial of Arthrotec. This was a solution my doctor came up with. I've never had consistant heart burn or indigestion_ no signs of acid reflux_ so I was confused as to why he would offer me this medication. The first day I took both pills_ I experienced some dizziness and some nausea. I was at work_ so I just had to brush it off. It continued each time I took it. After about two days (two doses)_ I began to feel very anxious and started to get a slightly elevated heart rate. I felt it was normal because I have been having some chest pains_ so it could just be what's already there. On the evening of 4/30_ I suddenly got some serious chest pains_ an elevated heart rate (I was laying down with my husband and this was similar to an ""I just finished running!"" heart rate)_ hot flashes_ dizziness_ and weakness in my legs. I litterally thought I was dying. It passed within 45 minutes and I was able to go to work the next day. At work (5/1)_ I was sitting at my desk and the same thing happened. I stepped out to get some air but it didn't work. A friend at work had to call an ambulance. I was filled in by the ER doc that the mixture of Aciphex and Arthrotec was insane and that he was trying to keep from cracking up at my primary doc's decision to combine them. I went to the hospital because of these meds. BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN TAKING ESPECIALLY MIXED WITH OTHER MEDS.",F,20,6  days20 MG 1X D,5/2/2012,Aciphex

I thought the lump feeling in my throat was from the biopsy maybe not healing right or something. This was very uncomfortable and feeling like my throat was closing up_ like I had a rock in my throat. It was making me feel very depressed_ because it was so uncomfortable. I am so glad to have found this website and that others had these experiences also. I stopped Aciphex today and will take pepcid instead. Thank you to everyone who listed their experiences. I think these forums work better sometimes then the doctors themselves who don't even bother to monitor side effects of the drugs they prescribe.

After taking 'Pariet' (same as Aciphex) for 10 days I had my first ever panic attack while being a passenger in a car.  Out of nowhere my heart started racing_ my limbs went tingly and and I was very dizzy and 'out of it'.  I thought I was having a stroke.  2 days later another panic attack in the car.  I thought it may have been the pariet so stopped taking them.  Then as my original duondenitis symptoms returned I decided to take Pariet again and that day - another panic attack.  Over a period of 2 weeks whilst taking Pariet on and off_ I have felt generally unwell and extremely anxious.  I've never had to call 000 in my life_ but in the last 2 weeks I've called 3 times with stroke and heart attack like symptoms.  3 days ago_ I had my worst panic attack yet_ so I've vowed never to take pariet again.

I called Kaiser doc to tell him and his nurse said they had never heard of anyone GETTING acid reflux (or any of my other symptoms) from taking the drug!! I thought I had lost my mind.... Now I know what happened. I believe first drug was Reglan? Then switched to Prevacid_ and now on Aciphex. I have been suffering for years with many of the nasty symptons folks have posted here! I'm stopping all PPI's today (will use tap",Read this website!! I now feel that many_ if not all PPI's are poison!,F,51,3  years20 MG 1X D,9/3/2011Email,Aciphex
48, 2, Acid reflux,Tightness in throat_ anxiety_ night sweats_ shortness of breath_ fatigue_ tingling face_ tingling and numbness in arms and legs_ rare chest pains_ headaches_ nausea,"I was prescribed the generic version here in Canada (SDZ-Rapeprazole) due to a ""choking sensation"" I've been having in my throat for about a year_ coupled with burping/acidic taste in my mouth. After about two weeks of using this drug and no results (also no symptoms other than headache + nausea) I went back to my doc who suggested upping dose to 2x daily (once at night and once in the morning). About a week into it_ I started getting a very tight/swollen-looking throat_ worse than anything before the drug_ as well as a host of other symptoms_ most troubling was the tingling in the face and in my hands/feet. I also got several muscle spasms in my calves. I did not relate any of these symptoms to this drug until reading this forum and it's making a lot of sense now. STOPPING IT RIGHT NOW.",F,27,45  days20 mg 2X D,8/3/2011Email,Aciphex
49, 5, Gerd,No side effects at the present time.  When I first started taking I would get headaches.  It has been wonderful for my acid reflux,LOVE IT!,F,50,10  years 1X D,7/25/2011Email,Aciphex
50, 4, Helicobacter pylori,None.,I was given Aciphex along with two antibiotics to treat Helicobacter pylori. It helped to heal my ulcer_ but eventually it wasn't as effective in combating my acid reflux and I had to switch to Nexium_ which worked good and was cheaper.,F,24,1  years20MG 1X D,5/15/2011Email,Aciphex
51, 4, Acute gastritis,I have experienced no side effects,The drug has worked great and almost all my symtoms like nausea_ stomach burning and indigestion are almost all gone.  The only thing I am concerned about is that long term use of PPI's like aciphex can cause osteoporosis which I do not think anyone wants to experience.  I have read some posts where people have become dependent on this  drug.  I just hope there are some other alternatives out there because I do not want to become dependent on this drug at all.,M,29,3  months20 mg 1X D,4/27/2011,Aciphex
52, 5, acid reflux,I take one pill each morning before breakfast.Absolutely no more acid reflex and no side effects,I am surprised at all the side effects on the web site.This drug seems fine with me!!!!,M,77,7  years20mg 1X D,4/19/2011,Aciphex
53, 2, Reflux,The primary side effects I've experienced has been weight gain_ bloating_ numbness and tingling in hands (and feet)_ and swelling of hands/feet.,While Aciphex did help get rid of the Acid Reflux_ the side effects are horrible. I had some other medication changes in the last 6 to 8 months and was unaware that this medication was producing these side effects. I've been my primary care physician several times about the numbness and tingling in hands and all he did was send me to specialists_ all saying that I was healthy and there is no apparent reason for the numbness and tingling. Don't doctors read the side effects of the medications they prescribe? It took me less than 10 minutes on Google to find extensive side effects lists and this site.,M,52,8  months20 1X D,3/4/2011Email,Aciphex
54, 1, acid reflux/GERDA,When I began taking this medicine_ I had faith in the physician prescribing the medicine. I suffered at the time from occasional acid reflux and had chest pains which the doctor said were related to GERDA. Did not pay attention to side effects at the time. Began usage after stopping for three weeks_ and now have uncontrollable diarrhea_ stomach cramps_ and gas.,Daughter convinced me to try and get off the medication because of the prolonged usage side effects. Attempted her advise of taking probiotics capsules by emptying contents directly into tongue and drinking water at the first sign of acidity in the stomach. This worked until I had something to eat that triggered an excess of acid_ so I decided to start with Aciphex again. I have been affected by the medication considerable and I'm thinking of taking something over the counter if needed_ and go back to the probiotics on a regular basis.,F,67,3  years20MG 1X D,2/19/2011,Aciphex
55, 1, Food Poisoning/Bad Stomach,My doctor gave me a sample to try after I'd gotten sick from bad restaurant food. After taking just one pill_ I woke up the following morning with what was at first a itchy pinky finger. It then started to become blistered_ the itchiness more intense and spread to my body and face. By the end of the day_ I was covered with blisters_ and incredibly itchy. As the days went on_ it seemed to get worse_ my face became crust-like because the blisters were so bad_ my skin felt like it was burning_ the itchiness was so intense. I almost went to the emergency room but decided to wait it out. It finally started to stop spreading after a few days_ but the healing of my skin took at least a month. That month was one of the scariest of my life. I didn't know if my skin would be damaged permanently or not. Even my sweat glands had been affectd_ I couldn't sweat even during intense exercise. I've heard that in severe cases_ people have died from this type of allergic reaction.,I will NEVER take Aciphex again. To this day (it's been about 2yrs. now)_ my skin isn't like it was before the reaction. For me it was many times worse than when I had the Chicken Pox a few years ago.,F,41,1  days20mg 1X D,2/16/2011,Aciphex
56, 2, possible anxiety induced ulcers,horrible bloated full feeling from day one_constantly feeling like i need to burp but can't_ pain below liver area_ disoriented_ light headed_ heart palps_some nausea that feels like if I threw up I would feel better but I never do. weird dreams and trouble sleeping. low grade fever of 99.5 since day 2,I do not have heartburn. no GERD that I know of_ doc put me on this after ruling out liver and pancreatic issues for a bad stomach which he thinks is from anxiety_ assuming I had ulcers_ pains were stabbing and sharp. no more of this for me_ tired of feeling woozy and out of if too.  going to take mastic instead_ it works better.,F,46,2  weeks20 1X D,2/1/2011,Aciphex
57, 1, Acid Reflux,Follow up to previous post,So I have been off Aciphex for two days now - all symptoms have subsided. I no longer have the hot and cold flashes in my hands and numbness in my feet. I woke up today feeling very well. While this drug may be very effective and for some it may work just fine with no side effects_ it was a horrible time for me. Please use caution when taking this medication.,M,33, 30 mg 1X D,1/27/2011History,Aciphex
58, 5, Gerd_ Acid reflex,no side effects at all but after stoping it a few times all the reflex and symptoms come back so i asked my doctor how long do i take this?
