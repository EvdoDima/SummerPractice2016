I might try and drop the Aciphex to see if those things work fine without this drug as I'm not too keen of the side effects: constipation_ trouble falling asleep and trouble waking up in the morning_ complete apathy which includes no sex drive which is the main reason I want to get off this drug.,M,44,30  days20 1X D,1/27/2016Email,Aciphex

13, 4, Acid Reflux,Where do I start???,I have been on and off Aciphex for such a long time. I was put on it after having a scope done and they found a little sore in my esophagus. I never really had reflux much before taking this drug. When I have attempted to stop taking it I end up miserable!! I am going through this now. The Dr. didn't ok my refill because of the holiday I guess. I have been off completely now for 3 days. I have so much acid_ basically can't eat because EVERYTHING is making it worse. I have had diarrhea_ cramping. My left leg and foot plus my left arm and hand feels tingly. I have a dizzy head and slight headache. After searching for help online I stumbled on this posting. OMG! I am realizing that after reading all the posts that others have had horrible side effects. I am shocked! I have had irregular heartbeats for years. My previously thick hair is now thin. My skin is always dry_ my nails are brittle. I am always tired and feel like I have the flu. I have been to the Dr. with these symptoms for years. Never find a thing. Could it really be this drug??? I don't think he has ever considered the side effects of this drug and especially being on it for so long. I had one Dr. tell me I would have to be on it the rest of my life. Just like a diabetic has to be on a life long med. I just don't know how I will be able to get over these terrible withdrawal symptoms. But I can not go back on this medicine!! I am going back to the Dr. this week and give him the link to this website. Praying you all can,F,61,10  years20 MG 1X D,12/1/2013Email,Aciphex

16, 1, Hiatus hernia,I've experienced heart palpitations_ elevated liver enzymes_ swollen ankles_ feet_  and legs. Dry mouth_ joint pain_ weakened bones_ eye twitches_ and back pain.,Since being on this medicine_ my big concern is on my liver and weakened bones_ I've even had a broken wrist. Ive tried to get off of it_ however when I skip a dose it feels 10x worst.  When they put me on aciphex_ they also put me on calcium -vit D and magnesium.  I've been on a vitamin D 50_000 unit treatment for 8 wks_ twice already.  When I spoke to my doctor about how I feel when skipping a dose she said_ the pills work by blocking the pumps in your stomach_ naturally your stomach will then produce more pumps_ until finally your stomach has made thousands of pumps. When you stop taking them_ all pumps are working full force making the acid reflux unbearable. If they know all this why do they prescribe it in the first place? For me it's now finding something that will work or surgery. :(   My cousin was just diagnosed with the same hernia I have and they prescribed her aciphex_ I sent her this link. She said she was not going to be taking them.  For those of you with no side effects_ that's wonderful_ you're one of the lucky ones_ for those of us not so lucky_ please be cautious of what you are taking. These are very dangerous and like drugs_ can be very addicting.  When the heartburn starts up that bad your running looking for that little yellow pill.  I should've seen it before_ yellow for warning.  Please do not take this!!,F,43,8  months20 mg 1X D,8/7/2013Email,Aciphex
17, 3, severe acid reflux from opiates,Totally stopped the symptoms_ no noticeable side effects at first.  BUT...see comments.,Over the long term_ I lost about half my hair; and I have to supplement a number of vitamins and calcium_ because Aciphex blocks absorption.  Then my insurance stopped covering it; and since nothing else works for me at this point_ I began paying for it myself. Without insurance_ it's $365 for 30 pills and it keeps going up. Even worse -- after all these years of doctors telling me I had to take it to prevent throat cancer_ the New York Times just published an article about a study showing that PPI medication may CAUSE throat cancer.  The problem is_ once you're on it_ your body adjusts; and it's very difficult (impossible?) to get off. Meanwhile_ it's become less effective over time. I now have reflux even after taking it.  My doctor tells me to double the dose.  No way!  It's a slippery slope. My advice would be DON'T START.,F,67,8  years10-20 1X D,6/3/2013,Aciphex

23, 4, GERD & Barrett's Esophagus,Headaches daily_ some tremors in my hands and fingers_ loss of appetite.,I was taking Omezparole for about a week or so due to some acid reflux issues at the time_ which were still unclear to me then_ and developed a full body rash.  Afterwards_ I was diagnosed with GERD and Barrett's Esophagus and subscribed Aciphex.  I've been on it for almosty a week now along with Calcium with D3 supplements twice daily to hinder any early on-set Osteoperosis.  So far the acid reflux has been a lot better and still feel occasional chest pain if I've eated something really fatty_ but mostly the acid reflux symptoms have dissolved.  The only thing that worries me are the tremors I've had.  At first I thought it was just an old injury acting up (I injured my hand a couple of years ago and hurts every so often)_ but then it happened in the other hand.

24, 5, Barret's esophagus diagnosis.,None.,I highly advise anyone who has acid reflux more than 3 times per week to definitely talk to a good doctor about it.  I had reflux at least 3 times per day for many years.  I didn't realize how many bottles of Pepcid complete I had stashed everywhere.  Started with Rolaids many years ago_ went through Tagamet_ Zantac_ Pepcid_ then Pepcid complete before I consulted my doctor.  First_ my health plan insisted I try Prilosec.  That was four days of hell.  Fortunately_ my gastro's nurse called to see how I was doing on the Aciphex_ and I told her my dilemma.  What an angel!  She straightened that out immediately.  Aciphex has been a godsend for me.  I cannot believe the side effects some of the folks are reporting here_ as I have felt nothing but relief.  This past week_ due to something my wife read to me from the newspaper doctor column_ I took a break from Aciphex.  I didn't feel any side effects from doing that_ but my acid reflux was back in 3 days.  I went four more days_ and just kept taking temporary OTC stuff.  I am sick of that.  I should have talked to my own doctor first.,M,64,4  years20 mg 1X D,5/11/2012,Aciphex
25, 1, Chest Pains,Stomach pains_ chest pains_ anxiety_ fatigue_ headache_ erratic heart beat_ raised blood pressure_ dizziness_ nausea (even when taken with food)_ blurred vision.,"I was given a 9 day trial on 4/25 (three bottles of three pills) along with a 6 day trial of Arthrotec. This was a solution my doctor came up with. I've never had consistant heart burn or indigestion_ no signs of acid reflux_ so I was confused as to why he would offer me this medication. The first day I took both pills_ I experienced some dizziness and some nausea. I was at work_ so I just had to brush it off. It continued each time I took it. After about two days (two doses)_ I began to feel very anxious and started to get a slightly elevated heart rate. I felt it was normal because I have been having some chest pains_ so it could just be what's already there. On the evening of 4/30_ I suddenly got some serious chest pains_ an elevated heart rate (I was laying down with my husband and this was similar to an ""I just finished running!"" heart rate)_ hot flashes_ dizziness_ and weakness in my legs. I litterally thought I was dying. It passed within 45 minutes and I was able to go to work the next day. At work (5/1)_ I was sitting at my desk and the same thing happened. I stepped out to get some air but it didn't work. A friend at work had to call an ambulance. I was filled in by the ER doc that the mixture of Aciphex and Arthrotec was insane and that he was trying to keep from cracking up at my primary doc's decision to combine them. I went to the hospital because of these meds. BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN TAKING ESPECIALLY MIXED WITH OTHER MEDS.",F,20,6  days20 MG 1X D,5/2/2012,Aciphex

I thought the lump feeling in my throat was from the biopsy maybe not healing right or something. This was very uncomfortable and feeling like my throat was closing up_ like I had a rock in my throat. It was making me feel very depressed_ because it was so uncomfortable. I am so glad to have found this website and that others had these experiences also. I stopped Aciphex today and will take pepcid instead. Thank you to everyone who listed their experiences. I think these forums work better sometimes then the doctors themselves who don't even bother to monitor side effects of the drugs they prescribe.

After taking 'Pariet' (same as Aciphex) for 10 days I had my first ever panic attack while being a passenger in a car.  Out of nowhere my heart started racing_ my limbs went tingly and and I was very dizzy and 'out of it'.  I thought I was having a stroke.  2 days later another panic attack in the car.  I thought it may have been the pariet so stopped taking them.  Then as my original duondenitis symptoms returned I decided to take Pariet again and that day - another panic attack.  Over a period of 2 weeks whilst taking Pariet on and off_ I have felt generally unwell and extremely anxious.  I've never had to call 000 in my life_ but in the last 2 weeks I've called 3 times with stroke and heart attack like symptoms.  3 days ago_ I had my worst panic attack yet_ so I've vowed never to take pariet again.

I called Kaiser doc to tell him and his nurse said they had never heard of anyone GETTING acid reflux (or any of my other symptoms) from taking the drug!! I thought I had lost my mind....

After about two weeks of using this drug and no results (also no symptoms other than headache + nausea) I went back to my doc who suggested upping dose to 2x daily (once at night and once in the morning). About a week into it_ I started getting a very tight/swollen-looking throat_ worse than anything before the drug_ as well as a host of other symptoms_ most troubling was the tingling in the face and in my hands/feet. I also got several muscle spasms in my calves. I did not relate any of these symptoms to this drug until reading this forum and it's making a lot of sense now.

I had some other medication changes in the last 6 to 8 months and was unaware that this medication was producing these side effects. I've been my primary care physician several times about the numbness and tingling in hands and all he did was send me to specialists_ all saying that I was healthy and there is no apparent reason for the numbness and tingling.

54, 1, acid reflux/GERDA,When I began taking this medicine_ I had faith in the physician prescribing the medicine. I suffered at the time from occasional acid reflux and had chest pains which the doctor said were related to GERDA. Did not pay attention to side effects at the time. Began usage after stopping for three weeks_ and now have uncontrollable diarrhea_ stomach cramps_ and gas.,Daughter convinced me to try and get off the medication because of the prolonged usage side effects. Attempted her advise of taking probiotics capsules by emptying contents directly into tongue and drinking water at the first sign of acidity in the stomach. This worked until I had something to eat that triggered an excess of acid_ so I decided to start with Aciphex again. I have been affected by the medication considerable and I'm thinking of taking something over the counter if needed_ and go back to the probiotics on a regular basis.,F,67,3  years20MG 1X D,2/19/2011,Aciphex
55, 1, Food Poisoning/Bad Stomach,My doctor gave me a sample to try after I'd gotten sick from bad restaurant food. After taking just one pill_ I woke up the following morning with what was at first a itchy pinky finger. It then started to become blistered_ the itchiness more intense and spread to my body and face. By the end of the day_ I was covered with blisters_ and incredibly itchy. As the days went on_ it seemed to get worse_ my face became crust-like because the blisters were so bad_ my skin felt like it was burning_ the itchiness was so intense. I almost went to the emergency room but decided to wait it out. It finally started to stop spreading after a few days_ but the healing of my skin took at least a month. That month was one of the scariest of my life. I didn't know if my skin would be damaged permanently or not. Even my sweat glands had been affectd_ I couldn't sweat even during intense exercise. I've heard that in severe cases_ people have died from this type of allergic reaction.,I will NEVER take Aciphex again. To this day (it's been about 2yrs. now)_ my skin isn't like it was before the reaction.

I will no longer be taking this medication_ and am hoping that the pain will subside and let me get back to living my life!!!!  I think the Physicians who treat us should  be made aware of the side effects of medications_ and compare these effects to what their patients are experiencing!  It could save us all a lot of time_ money and heartache!  The best thing we can do for ourselves is to STOP taking medication to see if some of the side effects disappear (with a Doctor's supervision - of course_ as stopping some meds could be life-threatening!)",F,48,4  years20mg 1X D,9/20/2010,Aciphex

73, 1, Diagnosed with GERS,My GERD increased SIGNIFICANTLY within three days of taking this medicine.  Anyone else experience anything like this?,I had difficulty swallowing and was incorrectly diagnosed with cancer in my esphageus.  Turns out it was an ulcer the size of a quarter with swelling_ inflammation_ scar tissue_ and raised nodules surrounding the ulcer (all of which made it more difficult to swallow).  I was told GERD was the cause even though I never had a single day where I experienced heartburn and rarely did I awake in the night with the burning sensation in my throat from acid reflux.  So in an attempt to heal the ulcer_  I was put on Prilosec and Aciphex.  Within two days of taking these medications_  I was waking up once every three nights with what I would call VIOLENT acid reflux.  The acid was in my nasal cavity and in my ear canals it was coming up so hard.  I would sit up and feel it pouring back down my throat from my head it was so bad.  Again_  once every third night for the first 60 days I was on this crap.  So I went from having ZERO noticeable GERD to having what felt like a whole head and throat full of battery acid for 20 nights over a sixty day period.  I am assuming that I was either over dosing on this or my body was just rejecting this for some reason because I don't know how acid reflux could be this bad without my stomach actually going through the process of regurgitating this.  My endo said my LES and all functions that keep acid in your stomach were fine.  After 60 days_  I stopped taking this crap as it was giving me an illness that I did not have before.

76, 3, Acid Reflux,For the first 7 months_ I didn't have any side effects at all. I had tried all of the other PPI's: Nexium_ Prevacid..all of them_ but they gave me headaches. A friend told me that Aciphex isn't made with the same binders_ so I shouldn't get the headaches with it. It was a miracle drug_ for 7 months. Then I noticed pain in my inner thigh of both legs_ just above my knee. Then I started having morning headaches. My Dr.tried to convince me it's from my diabetes_ but I'm currently trying to find a new Dr cause she's a quack. (she put me on a sulfa drug when I'm allergic to sulfa) Read additional comments,***Very Important*** You have to be careful about weaning off of any PPI or you'll experience rebound. At first_ I tried taking it every other day_ but the acid got way worse. The pharmacist suggested taking Aciphex one day_ then Zantac or Pepcid AC on the next day since they are totally different acid reducers. I need to do that for a couple of weeks since I was on them several months. Then start taking just the Zantac or Pepcid AC until I can wean off of that too. You need acid in your stomach to digest food and absorb vitamins and minerals. Being on acid reducers long term isn't healthy. FYI: If you're a person that has allergic reactions always keep Benedryl AND Pepcid AC handy. They are 2 different types of histamine blockers. Benedryl works for my hives and Pepcid AC for the swelling in my throat.,F,50,8  months20mg 1X D,8/23/2010,Aciphex

Lipitor_ Crestor_ ect.) FOR CHOLESTEROL_ THIS COULD BE YOUR PROBLEM_ AND NOT THE ACHIPHEX (or any other PPI)!!! I can't say that strongly enough!!! The side effects are VERY similar to what I see here_ and it fooled my doctors and myself for three years! You can safely stop taking a statin for a week. If your symptoms improve (as mine did)_ you'll know it was the statin and not the PPI. From what I can tell_ the statin caused virtually everyone of my GI issues (including bile reflux). I wish I had found out sooner. I even had a Nissan Fundelplication (sp?) and even that didn't stop the reflux. It was only AFTER I stopped the statin (zocor) that my GI issues cleared up. I later tried Crestor when cardiologist suggested it_ and within 3 DAYS my stomach started acting up again. 5 days off_ and I'm ok again. I'm still not 'perfect'_ but I am at least functioning once again. I implore you to use this site to see the side effects of your cholesterol drug to see if the symptoms match up. If they do_ I highly suggest stopping your cholesterol med. for a week or so and see if your symptoms clear up!!,M,46,3  years,12/14/2009Email,Aciphex

However_ the stomach pains I have are getting worse and worse and it does not seem natural to reduce the amount of acid in your stomach for year after year.

Dr. thought it was a pinched sciatic nerve_ but muscle relaxers and ibuprofen had no effect.  I stopped taking the medicine yesterday_ and I am feeling less of the warm sensations.  I think it may take a few days to completely stop_ since it took a few days to start.,I would rather have the GERD symptoms than this.  It was really scary.

Not only have I had bad diarrhea_ but I am also experiencing pain in my left arm and dizziness.  I was ready to go to the hospital until I came here and read how many other people have had the same side effects.  I am not taking one more dose.

All previous symptoms and reasons for taking medication quickly disappeared; the feeling of the need to constantly vomit_ heartburn_ constant day and night sweats were gone_ coughing disappeared_ the strange foggy headaches went away. * Day seven was the onset of dizziness and imbalance. When I turned my head or made any moderate to quick movement_ my brain lagged behind as if it were in a delay only it became worse progressively through the day_ each day.

After the first week and a half_ the additional chest pain and anxiety - that i think are from the medication - subsided. I felt it was worth going through because the burning_ aching_ chest pains (pain under my sternum) that I was having on a daily basis were so bad i could barely focus at work. I've taken Aciphex before and I recognized what was the acid reflux pains and what were caused by the medication. This works better for me than Prevacid or Protonix (which seem to do nothing at all).I've been on aciphex on and off since I was 26. I would also urge you to change your diet - eating smaller meals more frequently rather than 3 a day can help more than you would realize. I also seem to get reflux isues when my estrogen levels are low - if anyone has the same issue - please email me. Thank you.,F,29,3  years,3/16/2009Email,Aciphex

I tried a lot of other things_ but the Apple Cider Vinegar tablets works for me.  I did a lot of research on line and checked out an European study about the benefits of apple cider vinegar.

214, 4, GERD_ EROSIVE ESOPHOGITIS,First week I had a little loose stool...and I have had a little breakthrough heartburn but take a 1/2 antacid like Tums and I am fine.,I have to say that I tried all the other meds out there before giving this a try and was concerned after reading all the horror stories here but this has worked fine for me thus far.  I have researched and know that it is not intended for long-term usage and I have let my dr know that I do not intend to continue it for years.....I do have a slightly decreased appetite which isn't hurting me a bit!  Other than that_ it seems to work fine for me.  I have found that with ANY medicine you sometimes have to give it a chance to let your body get used to it...and most everything has some type of side effect..just watch the TV advertisements!

I spent needless money on blood tets etc. It took away my cough wich no other reflux med has done but it's not worth the side effects. I had been taking for 5-6 weeks and couldn't figure out why I was getting sicker by the day. This stuff should be removed from the market till they can make the product safer.

Had to get steroid shot and take antihistamine.,Didn't realize at first that reaction was related to taking aciphex. Was taking for at least 1 1/2 - 2 weeks.

218, 1, GERD,I was not told there were any side effects_ but I should have known.  I began having severe heart palpitations_ for which my doctor put me on a beta blocker.  The beta blocker wasn't helping.  I can't believe Aciphex can cause heart palpitations like this.  I stopped taking it yesterday after reading the comments on this site_ and I can't believe it_ but they are already MUCH better.  I also had loss of muscle tone and restless leg syndrome.  I will never take a PPI again.  It is absolutely not worthn it!  I took this drug for six months.  How long does it take for the side effects to completely disappear?,,F,47,6  months,6/11/2008,Aciphex

I've taken it steady for about 10 days now_ and just stopped today. I had been having some increasing anxiety problems over the time since I started the medicine- really random panic attacks and increasing general anxiety. In the last three days I have had incessant anxiety_ and panic attacks that sent me to the ER_ to my doctor_ and to a psychiatrist. The panic attacks start with a physical problem that I feel is likely a side effect of the drug as well. The scariest have been heart palpitations and esophageal muscle spasms_ and then losing the strength in my throat- feeling like I couldn't swallow- like my throat is dry and swollen and I had a lump in it I couldn't get to go away_ because I couldn't swallow. I asked my doctor if it was possible that the aciphex was causing all these problems and he told me it was highly unlikely and took my $120.

I took it one day and ready to stop.,I had a cough and hoarseness that would not go away after a chest cold_ 3 months later I still have it. ENT said it must be acid reflux after viewing the inside of my nose and throat w a camera_ acid is coming back on my throat and irritating it. This is his guess. I had occasional burbing or some acid coming up but not everyday.  I live in LA_ I personally think its some weird super bug.  No idea. Just annoyed it won't go away.

Started taking and soon noticed an excess of gas_ belching and reflux but no burning. Gums became red and swollen_ bleeding easily. Reduced from 2 pills to one and the swelling and bleeding stopped but gums remained red. Dentist said it looked as if they had been burned. A node was found behind the vocal chords and removed. Shortly afterward sore throat returned and voice loss. Doctor said he could not find anything that would cause those symptoms. Remembering the effect on my gums_ thought it might be the aciphex. Discontinued use and within week the throat pain and voice loss was gone. Then extreme acid reflux began. Never had anything like it. Even drinking water would send burning pain up from stomach to middle of chest. Gave up and took aciphex. Reflux stopped but throat pain began again.,Never suffered acid reflux symptoms until taking Aciphex. Now if I try to stop use_ the pain is extreme. I'm going to try OTC Prilosec or Nexxium.

Had chest pains and thought I was having heart problems that ekg didnt find_went for stress test (turned out good)different Dr told me stop sucralfate and continue aciphex and take pepcid pc.

316, 5, Acid Reflux,Feeling of fullness after eating less food.,Reading a number of the comments written before me_ I'm worried some people may get the wrong impressions of this drug.  Aciphex is an ion-pump inhibitor_ meaning it 'turns off' a number of the pumps in your stomach that produce and secrete acid into it.  Keeping this in mind_ you shouldn't be surprised if you feel more gassy_ as that's simply because the food in your stomach isn't being broken down to the same extant_ and the bacteria in your intestines is doing much more of the work_ hence the gas byproducts. The sleeplessness seems to preeminently in users you have only been taking it for a very short time.  If your body is used to heartburn while you sleep_ as lying prone allows more acid to seep into the esophagus _ then sleeping heartburn free may take some getting used to.

ALL PPI's are NOT equal!!,M,44,3  months,5/4/2007,Aciphex
323, 5, GERD,None,I have been taken Aciphex (20 mg /day) since 04-06-00 and have had no problem.  I have also tried_ but have had a lot of discomfort with other PPIs (Prilosec_ Prevacid and Zegerid) as well as the propulsive medication (Propulsid). I had various symptoms of gastric distress and sometimes Left arm pain with these other meds_ but never with Aciphex. It has been my magic bullet.   One important consideration for those of you who may also have osteoporosis_ my endocrinologist recommended that I switch from calcium carbonate (which needs an acid environment for absorption) to calcium citrate which doesnt.  This way Aciphex treatment will not be a problem for absorbing the elemental calcium. My advice to those of you who cant tolerate Aciphex is try other PPIs before giving up on PPIs.,F,72,7  years,5/1/2007,Aciphex
324, 4, GERD_ LPR_ achalasia,slight queasiness occasionally,My insurance wouldn't pay for Prilosec_ so the doctor said Aciphex is ok too. It dramatically reduced the inflammation in my esophagus_ larynx_ adam's apple and glands. My cough is gone_ and I have no heartburn. I don't know what the long term implications will be_ but I am very pleased so far,F,54,3  days,4/27/2007,Aciphex
325, 3, Gerd,Severe cramping_ leg pain and anxiety. These symptoms were becoming debilitating.,I did not know this drug was causing my symptoms. It did help my Gerd. I also have IBS and thought I was just having another flare up. The symptoms were lasting way too long for it to be a flare up. I skipped the medication for 2 days and felt sooo much better.  I had my physician switch me to Prevacid and it works great.,F,36,51  days,4/23/2007,Aciphex

My pain is gone and I'm eating normally again_ but something isn't right.  I also started Sucralfate_ and for the first time today I am feeling extreme nausea_ dizziness_ fatigue_ and chills.  I wish I knew which medicine this is related to.  I have Crohn's disease_ so I take this along with many other medications.  I just want something that works_ but I'm scared that the side effects of this drug may hurt my future.,F,18,3  days,4/17/2007Email,Aciphex

328, 5, reflux,No side effects at all,I was previously taking Nexium along with Nasonex to counteract some asthma symptoms caused by the reflux. They were not very effective so my doctor switched me to Aciphex. My symptoms have substantially improved with Aciphex. I also like that I don't have to schedule taking this drug before a meal_ which was the case with Nexium.,F,36,6  months,4/11/2007,Aciphex
329, 1, Acid Reflux,Weight loss_ rumbling stomach_ constant headaches_ sleeplessness_ dry mouth_ bad taste in mouth_ gas_ and the worst diarrhea I've EVER had.,I get stomache aches once or twice a month due to acid relux_ so my doctor gave me Aciphex. I've never been so sick in my life! I've been bedridden for almost 48 hrs with the exception of going to the bathroom and right now to see if I will get any more nasty side effects. I will never take Aciphex again.,F,20,1  days,4/11/2007,Aciphex
330, 5, gerd,,Hi everyone- I'm the person who posted on 3/15/07 and claimed that i was getting excruciating headaches from aciphex which i was. So I stopped taking the pill for about two weeks until when i thought i could possible be pregnant again and walla no more headaches this time :). So yeah the pill is pretty fantastic now without side effects and i would say definitely works better than prilosec. If anyone has more information about acidophillis as the last post has written that would be muchly appreciated.,F,24,2  weeks,4/8/2007Email,Aciphex
331, 4, Gerd,Short term memory loss... I can't remember if there were any others,This stuff really works_ but I was worried.  Something else must be wrong_ I shouldn't have to take a damn pill.  Within two or three days after stopping the Gerd would return_ full force.  Finally a friend recommended Acidophilis.  I began taking 4-5 acidophilis supplents every day.  GUESS WHAT-- My last prescription bottle of aciphex is still sitting on the kitchen counter... UNOPENED.  It's been almost two months now.  No Gerd.  Now I've stopped taking the supplements_ but I still drink sweet acidophilis milk.  WILD GUESS-- antibiotics kill the flora in your stomach that help to regulate stomach acid_ therefore Gerd appears.  Acidopholis re-establishes the flora.  I must tell you all that I was a total skeptic_ but desperate people will try anything_ and it worked.  (My doctor thinks I'm nuts)...,M,50,1  years,4/8/2007Email,Aciphex
332, 3, GERD,Severe constant pressure/tightness in throat_ particularly at base of ears_ along jaw line_ and along sides of esophogus. Sides of face go numb. Muscle weakness/stiffness/strange feeling in all major muscle groups_ particulary shoulders and arms to the point where it gets difficult to type on a keyboard for exhaustion of holding my arms up. Fatigue. Dizziness.,It took a long time to discover that the symptoms are side-effects of the Aciphex and not some other disease. The doctor even did a CAT scan of my neck to try and find the cause of the throat pressure (came back perfectly normal). It wasn't until I missed a dose of the Aciphex and the next day I didn't have the symptoms that I realized it was the Aciphex.  I then stayed off the Aciphex for several days and felt great for the first time in months_ but then my original GERD symptoms of shortness of breath_ terrible dry cough_ raw/corrosive feeling in throat/chest came back full force. So I started taking the Aciphex again_ which almost immediately stopped the GERD symptoms_ but the swollen/pressure in throat feeling of the Aciphex came back within 2 days of starting the med again. What to do?,F,35,3  months,4/8/2007,Aciphex

Also felt windburned whenever I was outside in the winter.,Had a dry hacking cough that was so severe I would occasionally pass out.  Tried water & vinegar and it didn't help.  Took the Aciphex and symptoms disappeared immediately.  Have since switched to Nexium in the last month in anticipation of summer.

Created anxiety for me too.,Thankfully_ I only took about four of these pills.......Have decide I will no longer waste my money on prescription pills for my problem.

I originally was using Protonix_ but my copay was much higher so my doctor switched me to aciphex.  I instantly started feeling weird.  I am not a stranger to feeling nauseated_ but I was severly nauseated on aciphex and had to leave work one day because it was so bad.  The strangest thing was the headaches that I was getting.  It wasn't so much the pain as it was the pressure in my head.  I did NOT like it.  I have since stopped taking it and moved to Prevacid.,F,35,30  days,3/21/2007,Aciphex

344, 3, Severe Gerd,Upon taking this medication I began having severe headaches.  I sometimes felt the pain on the top of my head and a sharp pain would come and go on my temple area.  Also_ shortness of breath and tight chest (very uncomfortable feeling).  It got to the point I was having anxiety because of the chest tightness I felt as if I was having an attack and couldn't breath especially after I ate dinner.  This became very scary for me.,I was on Protonix for about 6 months and everything was ok (I could pretty much eat what ever I wanted).  I tolerated it with no side effects but it stopped working and the Gerd came on very strong.  Dr. gave me Prevacid but it gave me a headache/diarreah and I only took it for 6 days.  He then switched me to Aciphex and the acid problem cleared but the side effects were too much.  Today I took Nexium and will have to see how that works.

380, 3, Acid Reflux,The medication works to releive heardburn and acid reflux.  I use to spit up acid in my throat every day several times a day.  Now I don't at all.  I had a headache_ and was irritable and disoriented for the first week.  I've had some slight weight gain possible water weight not fat.  After week 5_ started to feel the burping sensation_ but not always able to release it which has become a bit painful. After 6 weeks_ I started spitting up some foamy substance when I burped after drinking ice tea.,I've had acid reflux for many years.  Eliminating foods or medication has worked_ but neither seems to be a very good solution for me. I was tested for food allergies almost a year ago (ALCAT)_ which revealed several severe to moderate allergies to gluten_ gliatin_ egg whites_ cows milk_ pork_ salmon_ turkey_ chicken several fruits and vegetables and some additives and perservatives.  I tried elminating or cutting back on these foods_ but I became depressed from not being able to enjoy a decent meal (gluten and egg whites are in everything!).  I started taking Aciphex to relieve symptoms from eating these foods again.  Not sure what to do now.  I don't want to take this drug long term_ and don't want the uphold the strict diet.  Maybe there is a natural remedy.,F,32,6  weeks,8/4/2006,Aciphex

Most noticeable: depression and overall feelings of apathy and sadness.  I couldn't believe how depressed I became.  I didn't start taking any other meds_ and could not attribute the psychological change to anything else.,This drug was great at preventing acid reflux and indigestion.  However_ one of my chief complaints to my doctor was severe abdominal bloating_ and this has not subsided.  I do not think the benefits outweigh the side effects.  Who wants to walk around in a quasi-depressed stupor?  I received samples from my doctor_ but my insurance will not cover it.  I am now going to be taking Prevacid_ which is not known to have as many side effects.,F,28,2  weeks,7/20/2006,Aciphex

I also for some odd reason have muscle spasms/twitches around both knees_ my right calf_ and my right arm above my elbow.  I plan to stop taking the medicine to see if these go away.  Lasly_ I burp more than usual_ and seem to have trouble passing gas.  Possible other side affect:  constipation and/or diarrhea.,I went to the doctor because of a constant feeling of nausea that had remained for almost 2 weeks.  I was diagnosed with an inflammed stomach_ and possibly an ulcer (due to lack of health insurance at the moment_ my Doctor did not want to perform further tests).  My Doc gave me samples of Aciphex to calm my stomach and told me to eat bland foods and cut back on caffeine. The Aciphex has helped with the initial problem that I went to the doctor for_ for the most part.  But the apparent side affects pretty much negate the benefits.  The dizziness and lightheadedness are just as uncomfortable as my initial nausea.  So it seems pointless to keep taking.,F,27,4  days,7/15/2006,Aciphex

I was prescribed this med after having nodules removed from my larynx and since then it has prevented the reoccuence of this condition.  However_ after six months I was told by my doctor to discontinue the use of this med as it is only prescribed for 4 to 8 weeks.  When discontinuing the med I found that my symptoms are exacerbated by stress.  My acid came back within a month_ so I began to take aciphexs again.  When trying to discontinue my prescription after a second treatment with it I began to experience unbearable abdominal pain_as well as horrible gas and bloat.  I can not tell you how much pain I am still in to this day when I do not take this med.  Even by missing a day or two i am incredibly uncomfortable to the point of not being able to move.  I am currently seeking help to get off this med and begin a homeopathic treatment for my reflux.,This drug works to mask the symptoms while taking it but I have found that my symptoms return when the med is discontinued.

I truly believe these doctors get some sort of kick-back for starting people on expensive drugs and that they are interested in 'maintaining' people rather than curing them.  I hate being on this pill_ and I hate the side-effects_ and am searching for natural methods and lifestyle to control my reflux.  The long term effects of this drug have not been studied past five years_ yet doctors encourage people to become dependent on it rather than help people change to a diet and lifestyle that would control their reflux naturally.  Whenever I ask a doctor about control reflux naturally_ I get a blank stare (deer caught in headlights)_ as if I've committed a mortal sin by suggesting that pills are not the ultimate answer to every malady.
