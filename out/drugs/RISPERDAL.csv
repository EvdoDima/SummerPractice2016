1, 1, Depression_ ADHD,Extreme weight gain_ memory problems_ lack of judgement,This medication essentially created a 3 year hole in my life.  It turned me into a zombie.  I didn't properly take care of myself and had no ambition to do anything.  I was very angry all the time and still cannot believe the way I treated the people around me.  I stopped it abruptly and now have my emotion_ feelings and memory back.  My memory is great for everything before the drug and for the 2 years since but for 2012 and 2013 especially_ I really have virtually no memories.  It's like I didn't even live it.  I really wish I knew was I was in for sooner and ironically_ was so zoned out because of it that I didn't have the ability to see what was happening and stop it.  Luckily_ the university expunged those years from my record_ but it's still time and money I'll never get back not to mention my 6 year relationship.,M,29,3  years1 mg 1X D,8/6/2016Email,Risperdal

4, 1, Bipolar I,I was on a much higher dose at first.  That was pure hell.  No emotions_ severe akathisia (restlessness)_ not able to carry on a conversation.  Now that I am on a lower I used to be an enthusiastic_ happy_ joyful person full of energy_ fun_ silly_ a goofy_ fun side to me.  I used to have people drawn to me because of my fun side.  I used to have somewhat of a euphoric high on life.  THIS IS ALL GONE.  I am on a civil commitment due to some hospitalizations when I was manic and had psychosis so I am forced to take this medication.  I feel unhappy all the time.  I only now have the depressed and suicidal side of me left without the happy ups I used to have.,I can't wait to get off this medication!  Has anyone else experienced having a zest for life_ passion_ happiness_ an overall joy that is gone now?  I also have nothing interesting to say anymore.  Has anyone experienced that?  If so_ did you come off the medication?  Did the happiness_ joy_ enthusiasium for life come back and are you interesting again?  This guy tried to date me after I got diagnosed and was put on this drug.  He said I need some spice in my life and a spark.  I use this example because this is what has happened to me.  I am no longer interesting_ no spark or spice.  No more euphoric joy.  I used to be_ at times_ high on life.  Has anyone experienced this?  Did it come back after coming off Risperdal?  This drug is not good.  I don't like it.,F,34,6  months25 2X M,6/23/2016Email,Risperdal

I already have depression & anxiety. I was being abused. I ran away from the abuse to a crisis center. There_ I was falsely accused of being psychotic_ then hospitalized_ and then put on Risperdal. I truly believe Risperdal's the devil in a pill. It's killed me inside. I still have my whole life ahead of me but I've lost all quality of life. It makes me want to die at times. There's no point in living now. I still have side effects even though I've been off this drug from hell for a few months. Even if you do have psychosis_ I recommend Abilify instead!

9, 1, Fear and anxiety (hidden bipolar),My mom was given Risperdol back in 2002 to help her transition off Thorozaine.  She was taking 1mg and 2mg prescriptions and actually had a third prescription given which she didn't really take much from due to her reaction to the drug.  This drug affects the 5-HT nerve receptors_ about 8 of them that can control vascular flow of blood and also temperature regulation among other functions.  I feel in our case_ risperdol screwed up my mother's nerves or receptors.  Her symptoms are feet that burn in response to many different triggers_ salty food_ spicey food_ warm food_ warm environments_ normal skin temps on my moms feet cause pain flares and extreme pain.  Bad enough to cause her to want to die.Mom developed a burning foot syndrome condition while on this drug and stopped using it after 6 weeks.  The pain caused us to go to ER as her feet swelled up and that terrible pain and flares never went away.  She had to chill her feet and is using cold air_ fans elevated feet and limits w,Comments on statistics are regarding my mom_ not me.Onset of burning foot syndrome started in 2002 and continue to this day.,F,77,6  weeks2mg 2X D,3/28/2016Email,Risperdal
10, 5, Bipolar affective disorder,I started with injection of 50mg every fortnight_ now orally I'm down to 1mg of risperdal per night. At the start of 50mg I gained a lot of weight nearly excess of 20kgs. I slept about 13 hrs per day. Gradually lowered my dose and I made healthier food choices and joined the gym. Low dose of 1mg has helped my mind to not be cognitively slow. I've lost 15 kilos and am mentally well and stable and look like my old self again.,I find you have to help yourself help yourself. In my experience adopting a healthier and more active lifestyle does wonders and I also feed myself spiritually too.

11, 1, Intrusive thoughts/images_ anxiety_,Lack of co-ordination_ lack of focus_ no emotion_ slurred speech_ nightmares_ memory loss_ involuntary movement and muscle spasms_ constantly falling asleep,The first day I was given this in hospital I collapsed in bathroom and drifted in and out of consciousness whilst trying to crawl to nurse's station. I was confined to bed for 3 days_ with bedpan due to severe problems with blood pressure. The drug stopped me being able to engage in conversation_ I couldn't stay awake and even slept through a lot of my daughter's christening. If i missed even 1 dose I would scream through the night with nightmares and have hallucinations. Doctors were unsure whether my facial spasms would cease when I came off the drug. I have had to rediscover and rebuild my life_ a lot of my memory has gone_ and sometimes I have false memories.,F,34,3  years6mg,3/27/2016,Risperdal

17, 2, Psychosis,Twitching_ Depression_ Feelings of Emptiness_ Weight Gain_ Social Confidence,Risperdal is a drug I would recommend for those who are experiencing psychosis_ and mania. I was prescribed this drug because I was experiencing acute psychosis. I was satisfied with the results after a month or two_ however_ the weight gain was too much_ and_ due to weight gain_ my menstrual stopped. So I discontinued the medication. I believe it did it's course_ and while it helped with my psychosis_ the weight gain is drastic and will take a few months for me to find a good diet and exercise regimen that works_ for me.,F,21,5  months10m 1X D,1/25/2016Email,Risperdal
18, 3, Seeing things_ Hearing voices.,The first time I was put on this I slept for 18 hours straight. All I wanted to do was sleep. I had to constantly wake myself up to keep going. Weight gain. For sure weight gain. It took away my thoughts completely at the 6mg point_ they told me I was psychotic. I ended up getting off of that high of a dosage_ am now on 1mg and feel better most often. If you thought you couldn't function before_ this drug will keep you out of even being able to think. It also slows down your system. As soon as I got put on a lower dosage I right away had my hair growinf again_ I lost a lot of extra weight_ (145 to 126 lbs ) and am feeling better.,It can be aproppriate to use in some situations_ maybe as an emergency knock out if you're as bad _ but it may make you not be able to function.

The long acting version of this drug should be injected into all psychiatrists so that they can get a taste of their own poison. It would also destroy their career and prevent them from working.,Willingness to take this drug is a good indication of insanity_ as one would truly need to be insane to take a drug as damaging and toxic to the brain and body as this.

After 8 weeks going trough hell_ I decided to start again with Risperidon. But this time not higher than 2 mg each day. My new doctor agree with it. After a few days the effect of cannabis was back. Some withdrawals disapeared. And I go back to 3 times 0_5 mg Alprazolam each day. Currently using 75 mg Sertraline thanks to Risperidon_ and a stupid cunt doctor! Brainless man he is. Did no research about interactions between cannabis and Risperidon. Let me show you some translated part of a Dutch website calles Jellinek.

48, 1, Muscle Pain,When I was on 4 mg Risperidon each day I have a lot of side effects. My doctor prescribe it for muscle pain _ but he also knows I smoke Cannabis. He is anti Cannabis use.  I found a website in Dutch about interactions between Cannabis and Risperidon. But it was already too late when I discovered that. Because I have a lot of pain in my lower back _ and my doctor don't want to prescribe me stronger painkillers than Diclofenac_ I went to another doctor.  I asked my new doctor to quit Risperidon because of the side effects and interactions. So he told me to taping it off slowly. 1 mg each 2 weeks. When I was at 0 mg _ and I quit use it.

I was only Manic for a period of 2 months_ but they still continued to give me this when I was stable. The main reason is because I was on 5 mg a day and they had to slowly take me off it. Only reducing it 1 mg a month to the point that I'm completely off it now. It like I sign away my soul when a toke it. I'm just glad I'm a real HUMAN again. On risperdal I wasn't one.

Panic attacks from lack of sleep and swelling of throat area_ I was fine for 3 years until my doctor gave me risperdal_ then began the hospital visits. This drug destroys you from the inside out_ ripping you apart by the testosterone. I was unable to get an explanation why I needed to be on this soul stirring drug_ so I ended up booting out my psychiatrist for not listening to me when I listed unbearable symptoms. All I got in response was keep up the dose! :)Unless you are a serial killer or a rapist with behaviour that is so out of control you're going to rape the next thing that moves_ I don't know why any doctor would ever even think about prescribing this to someone other than ADOLF HITLER.,This drug will take away your life_ worse than I've seen friends go from massive OPIATE USE.

Forget about drinking alcohol and taking this drug the hang over was 100% times worse than a normal hangover.,I recently decided after 6 years of being on this horrible Nasty drug it was time to decrease dosage slowly and get off of it completely. The withdrawal symptoms and side effects are very bad. Grinding my teeth_ shaky_ I smoke more cigarettes_ and the worst withdrawal side effect is insomnia. I can't sleep through the whole night I'm up every few hours and feel tired. It's only day two of decreasing Resperdal and it's been a challenge already with these withdrawal side effects. I have no idea why I was on this drug for 6 years when I only had a psychotic episode for a few months and then was I fine. I do not recommend taking this medication whatsoever try an alternative medication or method. Thank God for my friends supporting me on this decision and helping me get through this in assisting me to get off of this drug. It's a horrible.

100, 1, Schizophrenia,extreme weight gain_ hungry all the time_ very bad flaking dandruff_ no libido,I have been on Risperdal for 15 years. I just accepted the side effects for what they were and didn't think about it too much. I have tried to diet with limited success. I am sick of feeling hungry and sick of gaining weight so I am changing meds under doctor supervision. This is a horrible drug and should be taken off the market. The side effects are not worth it. If you want to gain weight_ have an itchy scalp every waking hour_ lose interest in the opposite sex completely. Also feel doped up all the time and sleep a lot.

Personality became more low key.,I studied this drug alot and recommend it only be taken for short term use. It interferes with your neurotransmitters and causes brain shrinkage in your frontal lobe (animal studies). When you stop taking it  there are terrible side effects like restless movement(akisthesia)_ sleep disturbance_ emotional fluctuations_ and tardive psychosis. Some people get psychosis because of withdrawing rather than from an underlying condition. The brain has so many additional dopamine neurons_ that when you stop it you get extreme dopamine levels (like with psychosis).

My brain was left severely out of whack and the only way I felt ok again was to take an ssri called celexa (citalopram). We are all different and I had to go through a few ssris before I found one that would make me feel human by raising up serotonin again. I swore after risperdal I was through with psych drugs but really needed the extra help to get over the horror drug that is risperdal. Best advice I can give is to try ssri to take you out of the hollow pit of despair that this drug brings. I noticed a positive difference very quickly.,F,40,2  weeks2mg 1X D,12/11/2011,Risperdal

I was put on this medication twice_ once last year and again this year. I know the medication does all these side effects because it done the exact same thing twice now_ can't be a coincidence. It literally feels like someone's squeezing on my head and I don't feel like myself. This is hell_ I've been put on a drug for being falsely diagnosed with autism. Autistic people want to be alone_ I want friendship but I'm just shy and get bullied a lot_ they have delayed speech and some of them don't even talk. There's an autistic person in my class and I'm nothing like him_ all I am is a shy person and just get bullied a lot. I know I'm not autistic and I won't stop saying that until everyone who surrounds me acknowledges that. I've also been misdiagnosed with ADD and anxiety disorder. This drug makes me feel autistic_ fucking hell! I've just got off of this medication but nothing's happening_ I'm still experiencing the same side effects!

For the bipolar alone it's something of a lifesaver and I might have rated it a 4 or at a push 5 if it wasn't for the numerous side effects which constantly make me want to try lowering the dose_ which I often do and this usually leads to a brief high followed by my mood plummeting to dangerous levels and me having to increase the dose again.,M,34,11  years1mg 2X D,3/31/2011Email,Risperdal

218, 4, Psychotic Episode,This drug stopped my delusions that people were taking over my husband's body and talking to me thru him.  I slept very well on this drug_ but had some discomfort with having a stuffy nose (especially at night).  Initially_ I became very focused and was able to get a lot of work done with no paranoia/fears.  After several months though_ I became void of emotions_ had difficulty in following a conversation or contributing to one.  I did not smile or laugh anymore and had zero sexual interest or feelings.  I felt much less intelligent.  I was extremely hungry_ but was able to lose weight by staying on a 1200 cal/day diet and exercising.,I began to wean  myself off this drug after 10 months by cutting it in half down to .5 mg for 2 weeks then .25 for 2 weeks then .125 for 2 weeks(Taking B complex_fish oil and E) and now I am off it and I can communicate and comprehend and feel emotions again. While weaning off this drug_ I experienced headaches_ and about a day of mood swings each time I lowered the dosage. I believe what initially caused my psychotic episode was due to iron deficiency: heavy menstrual  periods lead to low iron_ which affects dopamine transmission and increases risk of psychotic states. I've given up eating gluten which can cause heavy menstrual bleeding and I am no longer anemic or experiencing heavy bleeding (which I'd had for over a decade).,F,48,11  months1 1X D,1/18/2011,Risperdal

My memory and intellectual ability has been permanently damaged. My interest in things/life is also very much less than before taking this drug. |If you have first episode psychosis take this drug only for short term (few months max) even though the Psy/Doctor will say to you a mimimum of one year. Really talking about your stress and problems you felt you had before and at the time of your breakdown to someone would be far more helpful. Trying to get out of the environment that caused you problems in the first place would help. **Also Omega fish oils** in high doses (1300 - 3000mg daily (Boots chemist) with a multi vitamin (B vits are helpful) Exercise also helps to realign the chemicals in the brain and is anti stress/anxiety). Also doing things that are pleasureable/treats helps to increase you natural barrier to strees. When I read that parents are giving this anti-psychotic drug to their children (- their non-psychotic children) I was appalled. If your children have anger issues/or even other very significant issues do not give them this drug_ at least I have some brain function developed through learning as a child/ young adult_ it would be terrible to perscribe a drug that has the proven effect of brain shrinkage to a child.

For over 6 months this was the only medicine I was on and I felt happy and was sleeping really well.  I would take something like .5 mg to 1 mg every other day or a few times a week.  In 1998 my OCD returned and I got overwhelming anxiety.  I did the tour of psych units that year and even had shock treatment.  The risperidone was upped to 2 mg a day and celexa_ hydroxyzine_ and klonapin was added.  I finally stabilized.  I felt very calm and stable_ but still had some depression.  In 2003 my partner was diagnosed with lung cancer.  I was able to be there for him emotionally like he was there for me when I had the breakdown in 1998.  I'm so grateful I was able to remain stable emotionally through the 3 and a half years of his illness and after he passed away.  It is now 2010.  Several months ago my sleep became disrupted for no apparent reason.  I would wake up after a few hours_ stay up for a few hours and then try to get a few more hours of sleep.  I could deal with this_ but the last couple weeks the anxiety has once again kicked in big time after being stable for over 10 years.  So I'm going up to 3 mg of risperadone and it seems to be helping.  I'm also still taking the other medications I listed above.

My muscles would become sore for little or no reason_ sometimes keeping me awake at night_ and the fatigue was insane. Waking up in the morning was a struggle_ staying awake an even bigger struggle. I lost interest in sex and had trouble achieving orgasm. Being an athlete_ my normal workout routine suffered due to the muscle weakness.

It is not a cure all and I think all parents should know that no medicine is going to cure all symptoms of bipolar_ but Risperdal_ to me_ allows my son to be a social boy and takes away the worst effects of mania_ which is the rage_ violence and psychosis. We have tried Zyprexa_ Seroquel Abilify_ Lamitcal_ and even ADHD medications and none of these control his rage and irritability better than Risperdal. I noticed that my son had worse side effects on the other anti-psychotics such as involuntary body movements. Risperdal does wear off in the afteroon so it is important to have the right dosage and as a note_ Invega_ the longer-lating version of Risperdal was awful.

Flat emotions can create a lethargy that leads to a depression that's drug-related. Most people end up taking some form of a stimulant_ even caffeine to make an antidote to the sedating effects.

I was switched to Abilify_ which was better but not great and then I just got off medication completely and now I feel better than I've felt in a long time.  I haven't had any problems off the medication and I honestly feel that I never should have been prescribed Risperdal in the first place- I don't deny that I have schizophrenia but my disorder was only bad when I was smoking weed and I didn't have the characteristics that most schizophrenics have (hallucinations_ hearing voices)_ I had paranoia_ delusions_ and ideas of reference but I've found that as long as I stay away from pot_ I'm good and don't need medication.,M,20,10  months5-2 MG 1X D,5/25/2010,Risperdal

292, 1," ""Anxiety""",Major disruption in menstrual cycle_ slight weight gain_ memory loss_ irritability,"When I was 12_ I experienced a bit of OCD and anxiety disorder and so the psychiatrist decided to put me on respirdal (keep in mind I've never been to a mental hospital and never broke down. The psych was at the office where I went for regular counseling as a child_ and my mother thought she could help the anxiety issue.) When I got older and did some research_ I was appalled to see that this pill is meant for people with much more severe medical difficulties than the anxiety and OCD that I had_ which I got over anyway_ mainly because I was tired of driving myself nuts by worrying all the time.Like I said_ started at 12 at 5 mg and was not allowed to get off of it_ I was under 18. Over the years the dosage went down to about 1 mg late teens. When I hit 18 I was too frightened to get off of it. at 19 it was down to half a miligram. Last year I said eff it_ I want off. My doctor (not psych-my PCP_ I had long stopped seeing the psych) agreed that I had been alright for years and so he started weaning me off in May of 2009-half a miligram one day and then .25 the next. I actually had more difficulty with the increasing and decreasing levels than I did with getting off of it_ and even then I consider myself lucky. I would get emotional and a bit of acne_ but that was it. I was on the ""every other day"" dosage until August. Once down to .25 every day all the emotional crying stuff went away.

293, 1," ""Anxiety""",post 2 of 3_ see my last post,(con'd 2 of 3) So far_ very good. Only withdrawal effects were very tired the first week and a half (I slept A LOT) and sometimes would get clammy skin. All that went away and I feel good_ hopefully it stays that way. I've been a good student for years (I'm talking the Dean's List type) and the respirdal never affected that side of me. Sometimes I forget what I'm going to say mid sentence_ or what I'm about to write_ but it's nothing horrible and doesn't happen all the time.Let me explain the side effects: Being started on this as a child_ it took until I was an adult to realize what was normal and what wasn't for my body_ if that makes any sense. My period was literally non existent (I could go up to 5 months with out one_ and I wasn't having sex.) My memory is very_ very patchy. On one hand I soak up and remember everything_ but then weird things_ like a trip to Disney World at 15 or friendships I had at 18_ can barely be recalled at all. I was also very irritable while on this medication_ with some belly fat but not much. Of all the pills they forced me on (that I got off of_ cold turkey_ when I turned 18-I could tell you HORROR stories_ like how Effexor fucked up my life and mental and physical well being considerably) this one had the least amount of side effects but the ones I did have were significant (the period problem was the main reason I've put off sex-there is...con'd next comment of mine,F,22,10  years,1/7/2010,Risperdal

On the .25_ my period started getting normal. Now off of it_ it has been ""on time"" since August_ more or less. Bottom line: I never needed respirdal or any other damn meds my psych put me on. I stopped seeing the psychiatrist when I was 18_ as I mentioned before. It was my PCP who weaned me off-even he knew I never needed any of this stuff. I did not have bipolar_ schizophrenia_ etc. I was not depressed. I was sad_ which is normal for a kid with home issues_ but I was not clinically depressed. The minute I woke up and realized I did not get out of bed depressed every morning_ but that it was my home life and the shit going on there which made me sad (when I was away from home I was fine) I realized the difference between normal sad vs. depression. Depression I do not have and have been working hard to get my life to where I want it to go. I wish all of you luck getting off this drug; I did it and am very proud. But please_ talk to your doctor about getting off your meds if you want to get off. Do not do this alone_ especially if you ARE really clinically depressed_ bipolar_ etc. I was scared at first_ but found a very nice pharmacist who gave me the confidence to go through with getting off the drug.

Mood swings were unbearable on risperdal.

Antipsychotics redefine your brain structure in a deleterious manner_ and like all hard drugs are difficult to come down off of because of how your brain has been hardwired by the substance.

317, 1, doctor recommened,Those suffering from side effects of the drug please read!!!In order to heal from psychological injuries one should put their faith in a higher power. One should pray and meditate and change their focus away from themselves in order for healing to begin. An important ingredient is that you must have courage that you will get better. Do not let the constant negativity (which may be reinforced by the internet and other discouraging sources that you refer to) override your path to positivity and remember the one who is most critical and most negative about yourself is yourself. Hopefully these words will set a new course in the road to your full recovery. Its easy for someone to say it but I experienced it. This is my recipe for full recovery.

336, 3, 'Classic' schizophrenia,From the beginning of treatment I experienced amenorrhea (later found to be due to hyperprolactinemia)_ also galactorrhea and high cholesterol. Increased sleep duration; I now sleep 12 hours per night and am often tired during the day. Also_ I experienced weight gain of about 20 kilograms.,Am currently 25_ first began hallucinating at nine (that I remember) and didn't start long-term antipsychotic treatment until aged 23_ in which time I had two hospital admissions for psychosis. In many ways to be lucid and able to close to my family was a huge blessing_ and I appreciate it every day. But my dissatisfaction with the drug is increasing due to the evidence that therapeutic doses are also quite toxic; I've decreased my dose from 4 to 2mg daily and still find no relief from side effects. Would ideally like drug-free treatment; I recommend anyone considering taking this or any antipsychotic to weigh up the pros and cons of medication (with all its horrendous side effects) versus other treatments_ and only take medication if absolutely necessary_ or as a last resort.,F,25,2  years,5/16/2009,Risperdal

I can't go to school anymore because i am constantly in fear of going back_ I sleep all day and I have so much trouble concentrating.

341, 4, anxiety/PTSD,the first night I took it_ I took half of a 2mg pill_ and my legs were VERY twitchy (like severe restless legs)_ they would NOT settle for a good two hours_ my mind was wide awake. But after about 4 hours of dozing in and out_ my limbs became REALLY heavy_ even going ot the bathroom I could NOT squeeze my muscles to stop the flow of urine. I woke up the next morning feeling tired and drugged and in a BLIND panic. The next two nights_ the horrible drugged feeling in the morning lessened and then stopped_ but the restless legs continued_ and my anxiety was through the roof. So I called my doctor_ and he lowered my starting dose to just a quarter of a 2mg pill and these side effects disappeared altogether.,be very careful about what drugs you take with this. Cold medicine is supposed to be okay_ according ot the pharmacist_ he actually warned me they might make me MORE sleepy_ but said they should be okay (sudafed and alavert) but some of the above side effects were because I had also taken a cold medicine with it (had a really bad cold_ the kind where your nose drips down your face_ you know). Apparently the cold medicines can make the side effects WORSE. But this drug has made the PTSD voices I hear go away_ and it helps me sleep better at night. in fact_ I wasn't even aware just how little sleep I was actually getting until I began to take this medication. now I'm out cold for hours at a time_ and I actually wake up feeling refreshed and raring to go in to the morning_ not tired. The anxiety is lessening as well. this medication is a godsend so far for me. The last two mornings I haven't been waking up quiet as groggy either_ so I say if you're waking up groggy and you're having those severe restless legs_ you need to call your doctor to adjust your dosage. Adjusting mine helped tremendously.,F,36,1  weeks,4/11/2009Email,Risperdal

If you are experiencing any of the side effects I just stated I would suggest trying some of the methods I used to cancel out the side effects. First I completely eliminated the muscle stiffness and involuntary movements with 20mg of Inderal a day. Secondly_ the tremor in my left hand was completely controlled with 250mg of Benadryl a day. Third side effect I was experiencing was a problem with vision. I lowered the risperdal from 4mg to 3mg a day. After doing this my vision was back to normal. The last side effect that was a problem for me was_ weight gain. My solution for the weight gain was_ exercising and dieting in return I lost 30 lbs. Hope this advice helps you.

488, 1, BIPOLAR_ SCHIZO/DEPPRESSION,Have you ever went to the doctors office for the 100 time for side effect reasons.  This is PROBABLY because of the very common but extremley scary side effect called AKATHASIA.  Look up the defintion on the internet.  AKATHASIA happens when the medicine or Antipsychotic you take completly blocks the DOPAMINE in your brain giving you like very scary side effect.  Most doctors if not all will play dumb and say they have no clue what you are talking about when you describe the AKATHASIA.  They in fact no completly what you are feeling and prescribe you something to take the edge of the terrible feeling may be ativan or lorezapam.  This is a cover up an in fact it does nothing to fix the long term problem you will have with this medicine that will cost you tons of money in medical bills,Remember fellow patients out there the doctor is not your friend_ he cares about you but the Antipsychotic medicince he gives you is not caring and could be extremly dangerous.  I am not a docotor but have been a patient for 8 years and find that the best doctors are the ones that don't prescribe medicine and give you couensling for the full half hour you pay for not the in and out 5 minute sessions.  If you enjoy this medicine go ahead and take it if the doctor says so.  Calm is the question_ try to keep on reminding yourself that you are normal and calm is the key.  AKATHASIA AKATHASIA AKATHASIA AKATHASIA do not be scared 14 hours of this medicince and side effect AKATHASIA will wear off.  Then you decide if you want to take this medicine again.,F,30,8  years,6/7/2007,Risperdal

The voices may return for a bit_ especially if my brain has grown sensors more sensitive to dopamine_ but I now have the key of perception and maturity to ignore them.

Over the year I went to Jenny Craig and got all the weight off but now I am not working and the weight is all coming back so I am talking to my doctor about switching to ambilify so that i dont backslide. It also causes your thinking to be clouded to the point where I could barely consentrate or answer people when asked a question on the spot at work. Im really glad I found this website because I found that I was not the only one who has these symptoms_ and without this website I would not have chosen to switch to ambilify.,This drug did work and help me from going absolutely insane in college_ however there are some really horrible side effects which are not worth it.

With the med_ 8-10 hours is typical.  That might be a positive benefit except that I tend to feel hung over when I get up.  Also on the negative side_ there is definitely decreased sex drive.  I'm on three meds but I attribute this to Risperdal.  I also take Wellbutrin (which by all accounts increases sex drive) and Lamictal_ but I had the side effects before switching to Lamictal so I figure it's the Risperdal.  On the plus side_ it has definitely taken the edge of the manic symptoms (insatiable sex drive being one of those symptoms_ admittedly).  It has also eliminated panic attacks and severe paranoia.

Admittedly I don't know how long this has been on the market but I do know that it hadn't been properly tested on young people. As such it should never have been marketed to children. And the reason I was given this was because I complained about bullies at school. Don't do anything to improve my situation at school_ just put me on drugs to shut me up. If this drug helps you_ fine. But if you've been given a prescription know that it will not help if there are conditions in your life that are making you miserable. It won't stop the bullies_ the abusive parent_ etc. I told them the drugs weren't working and they wouldn't listen. I asked them to re-evalute my diagnosis and aknowledge that were factors in my life (not chemicals in my head) that were making me miserable. Being tormen,F,24,1  years,7/14/2006,Risperdal

602, 1, Anxiety,Side effects while taking risperdal:  drowsiness_ decreased speech and word retrieval problems_ stiffness.  Side effects while tapering off risperdal:  jaw (chewing) movements_ tremors_ panic attacks_ facial grimacing_ ringing in ears_ abnormal movements in arms and legs.  Side effects started calming down toward end of taper but jaw movements have still not gone away.,Risperdal did not help reduce my anxiety.  It initially caused insomnia but at higher doses just the opposite - hard to stay awake.  This is a nasty drug to withdraw from - I started quitting after only four months on risperdal from a dose of 1 mg per day.  I was tapered off by ten percent weekly increments over ten weeks_ and the withdrawal side effects_ especially the movements_ have been frightening to me.,M,17,6  months,6/28/2006,Risperdal
603, 1, not sure_ diagnosis PTSD and ADD,SEVERE weight gain (50lbs. in 3 months)_ sleep most of day_ possible seizures_ dissociation_ out of body experiences_ mood swings_ concentration problems_ depression_ increase in SI after quiting for long time,My doctor also put me on Topamax for the weight gain which didn't even put a dent in it and i was excersizing every day and ate a lot which was needed for how much excersize i was doing.  She would not take me off of it and insisted i was schizo.  I got 2 opinions from 2 different docs and the only similar thing was ADHD.  My current doc says i also have PTSD but now i am off all meds and succeeding in school_ and losing some of the weight i gained.  DO NOT trust doctors to put you on tihs medication especially if you are a minor because they do not consider your misery from side effects.  But hey if it helps you_ it helps you.    My whole personality changed while i was on it also and drug use began.,F,16,3  months,6/22/2006Email,Risperdal

605, 2, bipolar_ depression,I have been taking Effexor for many years before starting this drug.  After taking this drug for one year_ I am having problem with concentration at work.  Fail to pay attention to details.  Missing instructions.  For a programmer_ this is very bad.  Lack of sex desire.  Even Viagra does not help.  This is at 0.5 mg level.,This drug is supposed to balance my mood_ so I do not lose control when depression kicks in.  The drug does that.  I must switch to another medicine.,M,57,1  years,6/1/2006,Risperdal
606, 5, Bipolar 2 w/borderline tendencies,extremely calm and drugged when first taken at night before bed (might regret something you say to someone),All I can say is eventhough I've only been taking this for a week_ I know its the right drug for me.  I am currently on Concerta_ Celexa_ and Klonopin- and none of them stopped my nightly suicidal thoughts_ my self harm_ and my moodiness. I would be extremely irritable and have weird thoughts but now I feel like I'm back to my old self.  I am no longer afraid of when my next mood swing will hit because if I don't have a reason to become irritable- then it won't come! Before this drug_ I would just get irritable every other hour but I feel like this drug is great!  I'm just scared about the weight loss...,F,19,1.5  weeks,5/31/2006,Risperdal
607, 4, Tourette's Syndrome,Ejaculation problems_ low sex drive_ breast enlargement_ erectile dysfunction_ 100lbs. weight gain in first year_ panic-like states,Very effective at controlling TS in me.  I'd say 80% reduction in tics_ with dose at 3mg/daily (1mg x 3).  Now switching to Seroquel in attempt to escape side-effects.  I'm told I actually tolerate this medication VERY well.,M,25,5  years,5/26/2006,Risperdal

609, 5, anxiety_ paranoia_ self harm,None,This changed my life_ it stops my negative thoughts and feelings being amplified and overwhelming me and I am able to feel normal and happy and feel like my old self_ for the first time in years. It restores rational thought and just makes you 100% more able to cope with things. I took it for a brief period when I was younger and after years of trying to get it prescribed again it has had an equally positive effect. For me_ by evening out my ability to think rationally without self deprecation_ it helps with sleep_ restores a sense of inner calm_ gives me more energy and makes me more able to act like the person I want to be and even to like myself. You should be careful with this drug as too much has a sedative effect_ or if it is not suitable for you_ however if you experience paranoia_ irrational emotions/thoughts_ ruminations/confusion and anxiety/psychosis_ it is a fantastic drug.,F,19,2  weeks,5/17/2006Email,Risperdal

611, 3, Socialphobia / Panic Attacks,Feel like a zombie. Blurred vision a couple times when I started. Slight headache in my forehead at first. 2 months later I am getting a slight twitch in my right eyebrow. Still feel zombish_ emotionally flat. Somewhat decreased sex drive but can still function fine if I have to.,I had what my psych. describes as an acute stress event. I started having panic attacks. They said Ih ad socialphobia since I hadn't left the house much in the last 5 years. This drug in combination with 2mg of Klonopin has prevented the panic attacks and made me feel less anxious. I don't like it though because I can't think as well and it's affected my grades at school. It basically feels like I've had a lobotomy. Flat emotionally and can't think as well. I can't wait to get off it. I'm tapering the Klonopin first_ hopefully will only be on Risperdal for 6-12 months. They also started me on Celexa 20mg/day so the blurred vision and sexual side effects could be related to that.,M,27,2  months,4/30/2006,Risperdal

What I am concerned with is long term effects in his little body. He seems to be have more and more trouble. Agitated_ drooling_ some bed wetting_ can't concetrate.

Increased prolactin levels caused me to lactate.,This medication was absolutely the wrong one for me.  My new medication management nurse practitioner was baffled that it was ever given to me.

630, 4, Schizoaffective Disorder,When I first started it made me really tired and had weight gain. Side effects have subsided.,This is a good drug. The only complaint I have is that over the 6 years I have been taking it the dose has had to be increased many times to keep the effectiveness. I started at .25mg and am now at 4mg. It does keep the voices and hallucinations away as long as when they come back my dose is increased_ only has to be increased once a year or so.,F,23,6  years,9/29/2005,Risperdal
631, 4, autism_ aggression_ SIB,Apathy_ mild agitation_ urinary incontinence_ polyuria_ excessive thirst_ over heating and sweating ,My daughter is taking this drug. It has been a wonderful medicine for us. It really improved her memory function and her communication. Does a great job for the self-injurious behavior_ but I find it strange it causes agitation. (it is supposed to help this_ not cause it) An added bonus is it lessens her stereo-typical/tic-like behaviors. At one time we wondered if the side effects were worth it_ but after being off it for 30 days we definitely decided she needed it. Works well_ works much better for her combined with an SSRI.,F,8,2  years,9/22/2005,Risperdal
632, 5, Depressed_ Suicidality_ Self Injury,First night on .5mg knocked me out. Now I have a touch of insomnia due to racing thoughts. Has helped bring back appetite.

Big Mac attacks.,I was suffering from a rather wretched dysphoric depressive episode with racing thoughts and terrible insomnia. 30 minutes after taking my first Risperdal I could feel the fog beginning to lift. After 48 hours it was gone and I was normal. This seems like some kind of miracle. My sex drive is somewhat depressed and I am fighting off constant hunger_ but overall it's a real improvement. On another note_ the drug seemed to lose its effect after about 10-12 hours_ so i take 1/2 mg before I go to sleep and another when I wake up.,M,38,30  days,9/15/2005,Risperdal

I'd thought I was severely depressed before I started--was I ever sorry to find out how much worse things could get.,I am convinced that taking this any longer or at a higher dose would have made me suicidal_ and ultimately killed me.

They have a tendency to overmedicate. The doctors recommended 3-4 mg for me_ but I take 1 mg.

I take 3 mgs. of Xanax for my severe panic and cannot drive without this one.,I think they're all the same.  I cannot do SSRI's as they bounce my head around the room and no sleep ever.

665, 4, Paranoia,Diminished libido_ increased need for sleep_ increased fatigue_ slight drugged feeling.,In general_ Risperdal (4mg) has been very effective at alleviating paranoia.  This does occur with some side effects.,M,38,3  years,2/27/2005,Risperdal
666, 2, Unknown illness mimicing depression,At 1mg per day_ I did not seem to experience any side effects_ but that may be because I took only one tablet right before bedtime. At 2mg per day_ with one tablet in the morning_ I became EXTREMELY agitated and maybe anxious_ as in I wanted everything to change_ or had to do something_ and at the same time couldn't do anything_ as if I were in extreme pain constantly_ all day.,I may be an unlucky one to have such a reaction to risperidone. It's also possible that my blood concentration was too high because I was taking Remeron/mirtazapine at the same time_ and anti-depressant medication apparently elevates blood concentration or risperidone. It somewhat started to alleviate my illness but I would not recommend is drug to anyone like me who doesn't experience a distinct classified mental illness_ and even then apparently abilify is better. In addition_ this drug was insanely expensive. Mother&%$&!,M,19,4  weeks,2/26/2005Email,Risperdal
