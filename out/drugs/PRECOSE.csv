0, 4, Type 2 Diabetes,Gas - not too unpleasant. As expected_ gas gets worse after eating a high carb meal.,Not that bad. Had to try something and Metformin gave me too many side effects. Reduced my average morning glucose level from 150 to 125 after 4 weeks. Might consider having Doctor up the dosage. Still occasionally forgetting to take with first bite of meal_ but usually remember to take it within the first 15 minutes.,M,60,4  weeks25 3X D,1/22/2015,Precose
