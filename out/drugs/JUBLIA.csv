1, 5, Toenail fungus,No side effects.,The BEST cure for nail fungus! I've had terrible toenail fungus on both great toes for 9 years. I had one removed because it was so bad and it grew back split and still had fungus. I noticed a clear nail coming through after one months use of Jublia. The split nail is now growing back together and both are now half way grown out and clear. It's a miracle!,F,,3  months 1X D,11/24/2015Email,Jublia
2, 5, Onychomycosis/toenail fungus,No noticeable side effects at all.,As far as I'm concerned_ Jublia is a CURE to toenail fungus. I had 1 infected nail for years and I tried everything from laser to Penlac to folk medicine. This stuff cleared it up quickly. Easy to apply_ no side effects. I'm shocked really and now cannot even tell which nail was infected.,M,27,6  months,8/18/2015Email,Jublia
