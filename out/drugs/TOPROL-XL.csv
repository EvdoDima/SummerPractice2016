0, 3, Hypertension,Initially no side effects. In week 4 now and started having diahrrea soon after I take a dose. I'm only on 25mgs a day. I always request lowest dose possible. Hoping it passes. The other med made me cough nonstop (ALTACE) so switched to this,I have sudden onset of high blood pressure. Was running 180/110. Came out of nowhere.  After 4 weeks I'm in the 140/90 range so it's starting to work. Hoping the bad case of the diahhrea ends. I take at night now. Can't take it in the morning or day hours or I can't leave the house. Always in the bathroom. Been using small dose of Imodium to help offset,F,40,1  months25mgs,6/3/2016,Toprol-xl

I have went with reducing dosage by a quarter every two weeks. Do not try and quit cold turkey or you could end up in ER like I did with racing heart and feeling like I was going to have another heart attack. For me this is one of the worst drugs I have ever experienced. Never felt so awful and the cardiologist had the nerve to say it was all in my head. Dismissed the side effects and said maybe I needed an antidepressant. Needed an antidepressant for being on the damn Metoprolol. God awful drug. How they don't see a pattern with people's side effects is beyond me. Stay away from this stuff if you want to be happy. That is my two cents. Hope you all can recognize your side effects. Is slow but eventually you will be in a fog and not even realize it. Be careful with this drug in higher dosages.,M,46,2  years50mg a day,10/2/2015,Toprol-xl

11, 1, Mitral valve regurgitation,Brain fog_ light-headed_ dizziness_ extreme exhaustion_ no energy_ neuropathy_ hair loss,I was diagnosed with mitral valve regurgitation at age 38 after going to my doctor complaining of increased fatigue and light headedness.  Within 8 months of diagnosis_ I had open-heart surgery to repair the valve.  My cardiologist put me on this drug (generic version) so that my heart would not have to work as hard. It did reduce my pulse rate and blood pressure_ but my blood pressure is already rather low. The surgery fixed my heart_ but this medicine caused some of the same symptoms that I had before the surgery. I felt almost constantly tired and fatigued. Sometimes around bedtime_ I often felt that if I did not lie down and sleep immediately that I was going to die.  Periodically_ I would get dizzy and light headed.  I had brain fog and could not mentally focus. In addition_ I began to experience new issues.  My hair began to fall out_ I gained about 10 pounds_  and I had localized nerve pain/sensitivity in one area from about the 12th through 24th month of being on the drug (one full year of this neuropathy). My cardiologist said that metoprolol was not known to cause this_ but after carefully weaning myself off of it by gradually reducing the dosage_ the nerve pain went away after a few weeks and has not returned.  I feel like my old self again now that I am off of metoprolol. The fatigue_ brain fog_ light headedness_ dizzy spells_ and nerve pain are all gone. I am back to my normal weight. I hope my lost hair comes back_ but I'm doubtful.,M,42,2  years25 mg,5/23/2015,Toprol-xl

Huge and dangerous mood swings.,This drug has turned my life upside down. I am a vegetarian_ strength and endurance athlete_ do yoga almost daily and am a relentlessly hard worker. I lost both parents within the last 1.5 years. The losses and ensuing family issues started triggering panic attacks. My doctor put me on Zoloft first_ it helped a bit with the depression but did not stop the panic attacks. He then put me on 50mg of T a day. The panic attacks started getting worse_ so he upped the T to 100mg a day. My life continued to plummet into a dark abyss. Hateful_ obsessive thoughts_ constantly toying with killing myself.. I have all but stopped working out_ which is something I've never had trouble motivating to do. I just don't have the energy anymore and if I do manage to get in a workout_ I'm gasping for breath the whole time_ dry coughing and nauseous. Let's not even get into the joint pain afterwards. I can barely mow the lawn now. I feel like I could write a novel about how horrible of an experience Toprol has been and still is. Until yesterday when I found these message boards_ I thought I was going insane_ literally. Last night was my first skipped dose_ I'm going cold turkey because I refuse to put any more of this poison in my body. I'd rather control my thoughts and breathing than feel so horrible. I blame Toprol because I've almost never had most of these issues before taking it.

Exercise is a bit different while on Toprol XL. My heart rate increases very slowly and will not peak above 130 BPM. Sort of like limiting fuel to an engine.

One side effect that has been great is my cardio endurance during workouts has improved drastically. With the heart rate kept down I don't fatigue as easily and can swim greater distances than I have in 15 years. Nice to workout and not tire so easily as was the problem prior to taking the medication.

When on once daily dosing at 25mg I was getting very strong rebound arrhythmia's. When the 2nd a.m. dose of 12.5mg was added_ all heart irregularities ceased. So far it's been working for a little over one month. In my case_ we were hoping it would lower my heart rate and RAISE my blood pressure to stop frequent fainting. Toprol didn't help to raise my BP so I had to add another med. The nightmares and nighttime air hunger were short-lived. I do not get increased exhaustion on the med_ but I'm still unable to run long distance or exercise like I used to before my heart symptoms began.,F,27,5  weeks25 & 12.5 2X D,11/22/2013,Toprol-xl

A-fib stopped when I took 25mg Xanax that I happened to have with me - my heart doctor was quite surprised_ as Xanax is not the normal prescription for A-fib...thereafter I took 12.5mg Metoprolol XL once at night_ that I reduced to 10mg.

The symptoms have been getting a little worse as of late so i decided to do some research online regarding the drug and came across this website and a slew of data showing the ill effects of this drug. I plan on visiting with my new GP next week and start getting off this drug. It does help mediate some things but when you help solve one problem and create a few dozen more_ its not worth it. If you are having some or all of the side effects listed from all the people here_ talk to your doc about possibly getting off.

56, 1, High Blood Pressure,I am taking a Generic Toprol XL.  First I was taking 100 mg twice a day when a doc told me to stop it.  Ended up in the hospital with palpitations_ speeding heart rate_ very high blood pressure and anxiety.  Doc says_ oh I wouldn't have told you to stop it if I knew you had a heart problem.  Hmm_ well_ I don't have a heart problem_ I told him it's the drug.  Had to look it up on the internet to find out what was wrong with me and had to go back on it to stop the withdrawal symptoms.  I am now on 100 mg. 1 time a day.  Not one doc will get me off this drug.  I have been to three asking for help.  Right after I started taking it I got dizzy all the time and was sent to a neurologist who said I was having migraines without the pain_ quack.  He put me on another drug.  Watch out docs will put on more drugs because of the side effects of the BP med. Then it just gets worse.  You can't convince them that it's the drug that's causing all your symptoms.

I have always had a lower than normal heart rate.  Although I have had heart stents before_ I was not feeling well after this procedure.  Real dizzy especially in the afternoon.  About 3 weeks after the surgery_ I went to the emergency room and my heart rate was 41 and BP was 90/45.  The Dr. weined me off Toprol (25MG)over about a 2 week period.  First cut back to 12.5 MG for a week then half of that for about a week.  Dizziness is still present_ not as persistent as before.  Heart rate is close to 60 and BP is either at or below normal (120/80) most of the time.  Not sure what changed with the stents_ but BP seems to have stablized.

I was diagnosed with hypo-thyroid about the same time a doctor prescribed Toprol for high blood pressure. I took it for maybe 5 years. When I read the comments at this site_ I realized that people taking Toprol had all the same symptoms I was blaming on the hypo-thyroid. I went to my NEW doctor_ not the one who prescribed the Toprol_ and asked her to wean me off Toprol. We did_ and as fast as just a few days after I stopped taking it_ I started noticing changes. I looked around_ and everything was suddenly more organized. I could think straight again. Heart palipitations went away... my balance came back... and the best of all_ I was a whole lot happier. AND_ it wasn't hard to stop. My doctor gave me a combination of Losartan-HCTZ and a different beta blocker. After I ran out of the beta blocker_ I continued just with the Losartan-HCTZ_ with no big withdrawal problems. May have to play with the dosage_ but did get off the Toprol without many problems.If you're taking Toprol - STOP!

99, 3, Tachycardia/palps/HBP,Constant cold feet_ strange and vivid dreams_ lethargy.,I gradually went from 25mg to 100mg_ for HBP that they believe was symptomatic of the tachycardia. It dropped my BP to 130/80 which is considerably lower than the 160/90 that I started with. This outweighed the side effects for me but I would like just one day of warm feet.,F,24,2.5  years,10/20/2009Email,Toprol-xl

101, 4, Tachycardia_ PVC's_ PIH,Generic forms of medication caused increased palpitations and put me into atrial fibrillation at the age of 28!! Switching back to the name brand and paying the price of the medication has helped significantly,Have been on Toprol XL name brand for 4 years. Tried multiple generic versions over the course of a year as my prescription plan mail order company kept switching suppliers. All generics of this medication are not the same_ beware. I had significant side effects on gerenic. Went back on name brand and now fine. Had my first child on Toprol XL name brand without problems and now pregnant with second child and still on the medications,F,29,5  years,9/1/2009,Toprol-xl
102, 3, high blood pressure,Initially this drug made my legs ache on simple walks.  Gradually_ that went away_ but it dulled my usually cheerful mood_ cut my energy level and now_ is causing hair thinning.  I know my body is dependent on it because when I delay my 100 mg. to a few hours later than usual (evening dose with a meal)_ I start to get a headache.,When the generic was available I used it_ but suffered with itchy scalp and itching on my hands just before the recall.  Of course_ my doctor made no inquiry when I asked if  I could be allergic to a drug I had been taking (in the brand name form) for years. I am so disappointed that a doctor would brush off patient concern_ not even asking if my pharmacy had switched me to the generic metropolol. I have had trouble losing weight since being on this medication and was alarmed when my regular doc mentioned blood sugar levels creeping up for a while and I I noticed how easily belly weight rolled on. Weight gain upsets me_ so I watch my intake and food choices much more carefully. The hair loss will be discussed at my next appt.,F,60,9  years,8/29/2009,Toprol-xl
103, 2, slightly elevated heart rate,fatigue_ feelings of depression_ some flu-like symptoms_ heart rate would not go past 110 when i exercised.,I was only taking a tiny 12.5 mg dose and was surprised by how it affected me.  My mother takes it in higher doses with no problems_ so I am not sure why I reacted that way.  I just don't think it is the right drug for me. The only positive thing i did notice is that my feelings of anxiety were improved taking this medication.,F,37,14  days,8/29/2009,Toprol-xl
104, 4, palpitations (benign),Dramatically improved my palpitations but decreased heart rate so exercise was difficult since my heart rate could only go so high; improved anxiety and calmed me down (big plus); limbs fall asleep often during nighttime if sleeping in awkward position; concerned about possible effects on pregnancy (may increase risk of miscarriage) so I've decided to go off using a 7-week step-down protocol,Earlier in 2009 there was a problem with the generic manufacturer that resulted in it being pulled from pharmacy shelves since the dosage was not accurate as formulated,F,34,5  years,8/17/2009,Toprol-xl

I said no way and finally decided to seek another opinion.  I have only one episode a year and occasional flutters which I now know may be a side effect as well.

107, 4, Migraines & BP,Heartburn_ chest tightness,Was on this medication for 18 yrs. but was switched to Inderal LA when it was pulled off the market for a few months.  Took a long time to adjust to the Inderal_ but 3 months into the new meds I started to lose my hair & had to go off it.  The Inderal was working wonders for the migraines_ but the Dr. suggested I go back on metoprolol ER.  It's been 3 weeks & a lot of adjusting from 100 mg a day (what I was on for years) now to 50 mg. a day.  My pulse runs higher than before_ but the blood pressure is stablizing. Had 3 days of migraines the 2nd week I was taking the meds_ so I'm afraid this isn't going to be as effective and my hair has not stopped falling out yet.  The only true answer would be if I didn't have to take any meds!,F,41,3  weeks,8/1/2009,Toprol-xl
108, 3, Pre hypertensive,Early days...vivid dreams/extremely low bp and heart rate...fatigue. Now 1 year later just a little fatigue in the morning. I take it at night.,I have been on Toprol XL 25 mg 1x nightly for 1 year. It was a nightmare in the early days due to side effects. I had tinnitus before taking it so can't say it caused that. I am wondering if it is making the tinnitus worse now as it seems louder. A cardiologist put me on it because of anxiety and panic attacks associated with getting really bad tinnitus. I think he was aggressive putting me on it and never told me about the side effects. I would like to wean myself off it and would appreciate anyone who has had success doing it let me know what to expect. My bp is on the average 115/70. winterbridge55@gmail.com,M,56,1  years,7/30/2009Email,Toprol-xl

Bad news/horrible drug matching many of the other reports and complaints on this website. I went back to the tartrate_ which I had been taking for 3.5 years_ and all is well.

I went to the dr. who ran many scans_ and they show one of my jaws is out of line _ so he called it tmj._ But--I am going to get off Toprol_ because I believe that Toprol is the culprit ! !  ! I have NEVER had any trouble with tmj before _ so since the pain in my ear is soooo bad_ I read that Toprol can cause gland and ear problems_ and tinnitus. I am going to wean off. I only take 12 and 1/2 mg. _ but I still think Toprol is the problem . I feel bad_ and can't seem to function problem. Has anyone had ear pain on this stuff?

113, 4, Atrial Flutter/Fib,Tiresome_ Low sex drive,I was prescribed Metoprolol by my cardiologist because of palpitation/atrial flutters. The drug seemed to help greatly. Before_ I was having palpitations every day_ sometimes all day. While taking the drug for three months (25 MG_ twice/day) I had only about seven days of flutters which lasted a very short period of time. I heard the drug blocks testosterone_ which is probably the cause of the lower sex drive. My flutters seemed to get worse when my doc was trying other heart rhythm medications_ in addition to Metoprolol. I'm trying to schedule the ablation surgery so I can stop taking Metoprolol and completely rid myself of the flutters.,M,36,3  months,7/7/2009,Toprol-xl
114, 4, Hypertension,Over 50MG this drug can interfere with sleep (severely) and can make your otherwise healthy heart work too hard_ but under that dose it WORKS.,"At 25MG Toprol my blood pressure is controlled_ and my middle of the night insomnia (3AM) is subsiding.  Stress induced PVCs and PACs (all benign) are minimal.  I've tried Vascor and Benicar_ both these drugs scare the heck out of me; Vascor created a symphony in my left ear (horrible) that won't go away (and I was only on 2.5 MG for three weeks!)_ Benicar I discovered is an immuno suppressant and actively used for this purpose at well over 40MG every six hours with NO additional affect on hypertension so this is NOT an anti-hypertensive drug_ it's intended for something else.  Do I want to suppress my immune system to lower my BLOOD PRESSURE?  I think NOT.  Toprol may be an ""old"" drug_ but how many people has it KILLED??? Not as many as some of these new drugs_ trust me on this one.",F,62,12  years,6/14/2009,Toprol-xl

I am now on Azor and trying to come off of the Toprol....that has been very hard to do.  Every time my dose is decreased I get heart paplations_ shortness of breath_ so dizzy that I can not drive_ shakiness feeling inside_ and these symptoms last for 3-5 days - just in time to decrease the dose again.

Feeling as if my life was going to end at a young age.  The fatigue and muscle aches were severe. I really started putting pieces together when my RX looked different and thought they sent the wrong drug.  I did research on many sites and found common threads in all of my side effects and linking them to this drug.  I was even thinking I may have brain cancer or something with the fogginess.  Started reading and appauled by the side effects that MANY people experience.  These drugs should be outlawed and drug manufactures should be liable for the damage they are doing to lives!!!!

I have been on 25mg for a 1.5 months and Ive had at most 2 noticeable palpitations and they only occurred because I was extremely upset.,I was undiagnosed for about a year as my symptoms gradually became worse and worse. Frequent and prolonged panic attacks & severe anxiety. I later developed muscle aches & spasms especially in my neck_ localized numbness in my left arm and face_ slight blindness in my left eye_ severe nausea_ elevated BP_ a resting heart rate of 90-100BPM and beyond severe heart palpitations. Felt like my heart would stop beating and then the next beats to make up for it felt like a horse kicking me in the chest. At my worst I was sleeping about 14 hours a day and sitting the remaining hours because I was dead tired from my heart beating so hard and fast for so many months. Even with all the sleeping and resting for 6 months and eating through the holidays I wasnt gaining any weight and I thought I was going to die.Finally I was put on a holter monitor and that picked up what my doctors would miss every time i visited them.I was diagnosed with MVP and an arrhythmia after having an ecocardiogram. After being on this medication for a week I was a completely different person. Almost back to my old self. My boyfriend was beyond amazed by my transformation. I feel the best I have felt in a year. I do get a bit tired occasionally but its worth it. I have lost weight while on this medication because I am able to be more active.

It was when I began using the drug from PAR that all the side effects greatly intensified.  Am going to begin the brand name as soon as it arrives.

After a year_ I was upped to 25mg twice a day.,While I have gained in the neighborhood of 15 pounds_ like another writer_ I believe in part that is due to my reduced activity that comes with age.

And it was fast also had funny pains in my chest and acid re flux which I never had before. Then I was put on a Hormone called Yaz and it made my heart soar_ but the docs didn't want to see it that way and raised me up another 100mg and then my HELL began!!Trouble sleeping_ couldn't lose weight no matter what regime I was on_ constipated_ dizziness_ light headedness_ major anxiety_ and then one night I went blind_ it went away but I dropped 50mg immediately. Then still had problems I got off the Yaz but my body had got to adapted to the High dose of meds and since I didn't have high BP it started to soar my bp up and down insane up's and downs'.

I don't know if on and off use is ok - my doctor hasn't gotten back to me on this one.  Blood pressure is a funny thing and we never know when it's going to spike.  You could go to the doctor every year and not know that you have high blood pressure.  I went yesterday and my pressure was 103/80 however today it was elevated again.  The secret is the following:  Loose weight_ exercise_ don't smoke_ and don't binge drink.   With this plan_ you hopefully will not need blood pressure meds.,M,46,9  days,2/16/2009,Toprol-xl

Told the doctor and didn't believe me but changed it to Toprol XL. That is when the real problems started.  My joints started aching_ muscles aching to the point I couldn't walk.  My hands swelled up_ etc.  I gained 40 pounds which I've never had a weight issue before and I was told it was because I was getting older.  For my aches and pains_ I was told to take 800 mg Motrin because the aches and pains happen with age!!  Mind you I was only 35 at the time of my first complaints.

I was on 25mg for about 2 and a half months.  I made my doctor wean me off of it.  I went from 25mg to 12.5mg for a week then half of that for a week.  I have been off of them completely for a week and still having extreme anxiety and some depression.  Does anyone know how long it takes to completely get out of your system?

184, 1, tachycardia,It has been almost a yr. since I had an ablation done and stopped taking the toprol xl.  This is to help all of you who are struggling with the side effects. ie_ anxiety!  Don't give up or give in. Don't let the Dr. put you on benzos or antianxiety medication_ believe me it will make it worse. I know how terrible the withdrawal is_ but the other medications will not help in the longrun.  Don't believe your Dr. either when they tell you that the Toprol would not cause your symptoms. I wish someone would have believed me about the withdrawal and had just helped me through it mentally.  I was put one everything from anti anxiety to benzos_ nothing helped until I got myself off of everything.  It took almost a yr.  I suffered from ringing in the ears_ esophageal spasms_ palpatations....on and on_ all from the drugs I was giving.  So this is what I did...I purchased a detox hypnosis cd and listened everynight.

Not sure if side effects I feel (heavy legs_ fatigue_ aches_ etc.) are due to the drug or the weight now - generic (which usually is fine for me) version did not work - had a return of symptoms (took me a month to make the connection).,,F,51,6  years,8/27/2008,Toprol-xl

I take a generic acid reducer every night with my evening dose_ which has helped prevent the horrible stomach pain. I was very functionally impaired all last year with heart symptoms and had tried several medications_ including regular_ non-time-released metroprolol for a year and I was still having a lot of angina_ fainting_ weakness_ etc. My brilliant new cardiologist was extremely thorough in his testing and realized that my beta-blocker was simply wearing off after a couple hours. I am daily amazed to be feeling so normal again! I can get through a full work day and I can go for walks and actually exercise again.

189, 1, High Blood Pressure,I was taking Toprol for 6 months and began having Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) and heart flutters.  Thank you all for sharing your experience with this medication.  A few months ago I decided to stop taking it.  I first started taking 1/2 a dose for a week_ then the next week I took half of that and then the next week 1/2 of that dose.  The next week I stopped entirely.  I immediately felt better_ more energy I've lost weight but best of all the number of PVCs started to decrease.  I still had them and I was also taking Diovan so about a month later I stopped taking the Diovan too.  I don't recommend stopping all blood pressure medications but I had to try to elminate these_ to see what was causing the problems with my heart.  After stopping the Diovan_ I felt about the same_ still getting occasional PVCs.  As time went by though_ I noticed they were coming less and less.  It took about a month but I have not had any PVCs at all for awhile now!  It seems as though Toprol s,I can't say if my experience applies to everyone but personally I had serious cardiac problems with PVCs while on Toprol.  I had to wear a holter monitor which also showed this.  I am blessed with a wonderful doctor who is supportive and willing to work WITH me to get to the root of the problem.  She explained that she felt the Toprol slows the heartbeat and that my body was trying to compensate for that.  She felt it best that I should not go back to taking the Toprol or that class of drugs since she felt my body didn't handle the Toprol well.  If you've never had heart flutters and PVCs and started taking Toprol_ and are now having heart problems_ please check to see if Toprol might be the issue.,F,53,6  months,8/11/2008,Toprol-xl

Finally struggled through to do research on a third-generation beta-blocker NEBIVOLOL [Bystolic].  Toprol is first generation.  Is nonspecific as to beta type it blocks [1_2_ or 3 and actually impacts on alpha receptors as well].  None of my physicians mentioned this as I complained_ but after I brought it up and insisted. They all said_ ""Oh yes_ it's a new drug].  Nebivolol has hardly any side effects.  It actually is a ligand [triggers] beta-3 receptors while it blocks beta-1's.  It also has a second potent and extremely crucial effect for SOME patients_ and that is vasodilation via enhancement of Nitric Oxide production.   Insist that your physician considers this as a replacement_ especially if you have endothelial dysfunction issues.  The Toprol will actually cause atherosclerosis and brain damage from its interference with beta-3 receptors and its blockage of Nitric Oxide.

When I started Toprol/50mg my BP was 155/100_ after 3 days it was down to 120/80. I felt like a new man. But now that it has lost its effectiveness my doctor has increased it to 100mg. But after reading every ones comments I opted to raise it to only 75mg on my own. I am very glad I didnt go on up because now I am extremely fatigued and have such realistic dreams that when I wake up I cant tell if I have actually come out of my dream. And I have to feel my pulse to make sure my heart is still beating. My heart rate gets down to 40BPM. But on the plus side_ my BP is down again.,I guess when you weigh having a stroke or heart attack against nightmares and the occasional hallucination. Toprol isn't that bad.

I had marked hair loss the entire time but did not think of Toprol as a possible cause. My hair loss got progressively worse and last year I ended up in the medical office performing several tests to determine the cause of this issue. My scalp was completely visible and I was literally going bald. After finding this website I asked my doctor to prescribe me something else for high blood pressure and she DID NOT want to do it!! She stated that Toprol could not be cause!! After insisting_ she finally took me off of it but I had a very rough time! My heart was beating so fast that I thought I was going to have a heart attack. I got very weak and even walking up the stairs caused me to get exhausted with major tachycardia. VERY SCARY. I toughed it out and slowly cut down my dose over a period of 3 weeks.

I have had no problems in the past year because I quit smoking_ drinking_ fast food_ etc. and live a very healthy 'mature' lifestyle.  Practically a vegetarian now_ too!  No tachycardia.  Blood pressure a little high in her office so she automatically assumed I have high blood pressure all the time and told me she wouldn't give me my surgery referral unless I agreed to take beta blockers as a safeguard during my surgery that nothing would happen.

It has been unbelievable!! Now she wants me to see a shrink.  Well guess what..I do have an appt. with an endocrinologist_ but in the  meantime I have been doing some research...guess what really helps the adrenoline rushes?  Aleve.  It blocks the hormone that causes pain and adrenoline.  Can you believe it?  I have been symptom free for a week now and am sooooo thankful.

243, 1, high blood pressure,rapid pulse_ blurry vision_ dizziness_ extreme fatigue_confusion_ constant runny nose,My new doctor was worried that I had borderline high blood pressure and assured me there were no real side effects with this medicine.  I agreed to start even though no other doctor ever mentioned I had a problem.  The first problem was higher pulse.  A change to generic brought on dizziness and took two months to rule out all other causes (doctor said it couldn't be the medicine)_ and I went back on the brand name. I had visits to the eye doctor about a filminess and not being able to see to read or drive_ and went back to a sleep clinic because sometimes I couldn't stay on my feet even with a CPAP machine.  I became spacy-not always making sense when talking.  When I started gaining weight for no reason I decided to really check out the side effects of this medicine instead of accepting the doctor's assurances.  I stopped immediately.  I've been off two weeks and BP is same or lower than before.  The other two doctors knew I was taking Toprol_ but didn't suggest a relationship.,F,63,11  months,12/21/2007,Toprol-xl

At first all went well_ blood pressure lowered and went down to 25 mg. Weight started creeping on and sleeping trouble started. In Aug switched to Metoprolol (gen for Toprol) and that's when it all fell apart. Insomnia much worse_ depression anxiety_ vision_ numbness and coldness in hands and feet. Went to Dr and he prescribed Xanex .5 saying women have emotional problems and that I had tendonitis in one hand and was sleeping wrong on the other. I didn't realize it was the gen causing the problem until I figured out all the problems I had been experiencing started with the gen changeover. He switched me to Atenolol and I guess I was still having withdrawal symptoms from Toprol_Metoprolol which was insane. Those were the worst weeks...I called him back and he took me off of everything cold turkey.

Doctor put me on the generic version (Metoprolol Succinate - 50mg once a day).  It worked fine for first week and then systolic bp skyrocketed.  Only problem I had was rapid weight gain.  5 lbs in first week.  Yeah_ they want you to lose weight and prescribe meds that put weight on.,Didn't like it because it was not effective.  I could live with weight gain if my systolic bp came down but it only did for a week and i don't want higher dosage.  My doctor wants to try one more beta blocker (Coreg CG - 40 mg) for 6 weeks to see how it works.  If that is unsatisfactory_ see ya for beta blockers.,M,68,2  months,12/18/2007,Toprol-xl

Found this site and read the insert after all this stuff so cant say either caused placebo effect.  I was told I could go cold turkey.  Dubious of this given symptoms.  I am going to look for other causes but it thus far seems toprol rots.,I think that for many_ the drug will not cause symptoms while being dosed.  I think that the trouble comes when the body disposes of the drug faster causing a lower serum level.  Then trying to withdraw from the drug exacerbates the misery.

Of course there is nothing in the package insert about withdrawal side effects.  All the say is don't stop abruptly.  Even if you withdraw very slowly with dosage decreases each week it is still awful.  Drug companies as usual only tell you the good things not the bad about the drug.  Don't start it you will never get off. After a few years on 200mg it didn't work anymore and I couldn't get off of it even though it didn't work.,F,63,8  years,9/8/2007,Toprol-xl

My doctor said that was the goal. sometimes I go lower so the medicine does not build up too much.  I used to have depression and it is totally gone now.  I use ativan at night as needed because I have MVP and ativan stops the flow of epinepherine(adrenaline) which sometimes is set off by the the extra low blood pressure from the MVP...good luck finding what is out of whack...I finally feel great after 30 years...yay,F,51,4  days,8/17/2007Email,Toprol-xl

Dizziness_ difficulty with linear thought (I wander) depressed_ major Fatigue_ but restless sleep during the night... the symptoms of the other drugs that I'm taking don't line up with these _ so I am making a connection between these horrible side effects and Tropol_ having said that..I'll admit that it's a guess but based on the other comments in here i,these feeling are as bad or worse than clogged artery. Also worth note is the fact that I never had high blood pressure or an exaggerated/erratic pulse_ In fact as I was having my heart attack my blood pressure was 128/72 and my pulse was 68 (in the emergency room)so I'm not even sure why my cardiologist would prescribe a whole 50mg of this stuff.. I am meeting with him today and am going to ask that I be removed from both the Tropol and Plavix...there are homeopathic_ nutritional and exercise programs that are just as effective with the only side effect being that you get into shape.,M,41,30  days,5/24/2007Email,Toprol-xl

After a week I began having SOB and coughing.  I had fluid in my chest that had to be drawn off and the doctor thought this was what was causing my symptoms. I continued to have the SOB and coughing.  After two weeks fluid was again drawn off my chest.  After the next two weeks x-rays were made that showed the fluid had cleared up but the SOB and coughing continued.  I did research and found that the Toprol was probably causing my SOB and coughing.  Also my hands and feet were always cold_ which was very unusual for me.  My blood-pressure was higher than normal.  I am now phasing off the Toprol and can already see the difference in the way I feel.  The SOB and coughing is much better.  My depression and feeling of anxiety is much better already.

I told him I wanted off of the Toprol_ because I know it's causing my weight gain.  I didn't know that it was causeing all of these other things.  I was taking 100mg of Toprol.  I am now taking 40mg of MICARDIS. I had taken this before_ but asked for something different because of a high co-pay.  That was one of the dumbest mistakes I ever made. I have been taking it for about a week and a half and I feel like a new woman.  Every single one of those side effects are gone.  Except the hairloss_ which may or may not be related to the Toprol.

It would go very high when I got upset or anxious. My pulse rate was rarely below 90. Doc believed this medicine would help. I am taking one half of the lowest dose -- meaning 12.5 mg. -- and have responded beautifully. When I am busy or hurried or anxious_ my heart doesn't feel like it is beating out of my chest anymore. Intermittent PVCs are gone. My pulse now runs 65 - 75 and my BP is around 115/75. I do feel slightly sluggish at times but have noticed that a bit of exercise -- even five minutes walking or doing some vacuuming -- makes me feel better.

398, 3, Anxiety_ Tachycardia,Dizzy_ tired_ low blood pressure.,I have been taking Toprol for over a year.  I went on it for Tachycardia.  It helps a lot.  I started having really bad dizzy spells though so my doctor has put me on a half of a 25 mg.  My blood pressure still runs around 84/40_ but my doctor says it will not hurt anything and that I am on the lowest dose.  I think that the low blood pressure makes me tired and cold all the time_ but I am afraid to go off of it..because I do not want the Tachycardia back.

400, 1, High blood pressure,Mental confusion; memory loss; acute depression; paranoia; anxiety; crying; feelings of failure & hopelessness; suicidal thoughts,The same medicine can be a godsend for some people and absolute Hell for others; Toprol XL was the latter for me. My first day on it I experienced mental confusion and decreased intellectual sharpness. I felt like I was in a fog and disconnected from everyone and everything. Despite my reservations_ I took it again the second day. In a very short period of time_ I couldn't remember how to do my job (which I can otherwise do in my sleep!)_ developed rampant paranoia_ had an anxiety attack that led to uncontrollable crying_ and experienced such profound feelings of worthless_ hopeless and futility that I thought I didn't deserve to live. I was only on 25mg but neither of the sample boxes the doctor gave me had the warning inserts. When I called her_ she said no one had ever complained of anything like I experienced and put it down to an interaction between it and dilantin_ the medication I take for epilepsy.,F,54,2  days,1/8/2007,Toprol-xl

I stopped taking it for awhile and started feeling better_ then started 50 mg a day and the side effects came back immediately.,This drug seriously effected the quality of my life. I read one lady here that said she thought people that had all these side effects read the drug info and imagined them. She also said she was on 25 mg and the doctor was going to increase the dose.

402, 1, blood presure,Toprol xl acts diffrent on all people- however I Had everyknown side effect listed plus more! being I also had diovan at 40mg and Ranidyne 150mg daily!(for heartburn) this mix of medications caused me meny hardships! and problems! and poor health. I ended up twice in the E.R. thinking I was having a Heart attack! when all it was -was trapped gas bulid up! causing pains beyound what anyone could stand (diovan) You must keep away from coffiee and soda pop! main cause of gas bulid up! it reacts bad with these drugs! also beer will make the side effects stronger !,switching from Toprol xl to Toprol takes about 2 months of weaning from 200mg to 100mg. I had help from a Doctor. who knew I was on to high a dose of Toprol xl..we also cutt down on diovan and ranidyne about 65% of side effects vanished -however after the first 3 days on regular toprol I started getting some unwanted side effects again! and the diovan side effects never stopped! one thing ranidyne users_ this drug is used for short term only! not long term_ it can cause meny side effects pains and cramping as well! I have been on this for years! after I cutt back on it.. iv noticed my heartburn isnt as bad anymore??  go figure ?

It's great so far!!!","My doctor told me he went on 100mg of Toprol XL and it was ""life changing"" for him in terms of making him feel less anxious_ etc.  He's been on it for almost ten years!

Limbido_ Mood swings would get mad esay.,I never had hight blood pressure_ Doctor was slowing my heart down so it wouldn't work as heard so it wouldn't need as much o2. Till they do the cath to open things up. This toprol started with problems the first day sleep almost all day the first two days. I stopped taking it after the fifth pill. Doctor wanted to try half the pill or a differant med but nope not going near that stuff again.

Still the hypertension stayed.  (I think this may be due to my great inactivity imposed by Toprol because of my inability to keep awake_ hence inability to exercise and lead a normal life.  Doctor would not consider even talking about the horrible side effects.  I made a separate appt_ but not till after I took matters into my own hands- - -  AFTER I took myself off Toprol and made a therapeutic equivalent exchange with another beta blocker atenolol that does not cause the zombyism.  Gradually_ I lowered the atenolol to 25 mg.  I kept the two other hypertension drugs_ but gradually lowered the dose 50%.  By being able to maintain waking conciousness and getting much needed exercise which I really enjoy_ and my lowering beta blocker equivalent 75% and the other two bp drugs 50%_ I maintain a normal blood pressure- - - one that do,Toprol is truly the medicine from h*ll.  I have few side effects from drugs others complain about_ or from some powerful immunosuppresants.  It is unfortunate that some doctors are too arrogant to listen to their patients.  This doc was totally inflexible.  The other two bp drugs added were trandolapril (an Ace inhibitor) and an old favorite_ verapamil.  Since I had no other alternative doctor in this greater geographical area (that took Medicare)_ I was forced to rely upon my own wits to get out of this health mess.

441, 1, to help strengthen my heart,at first i just felt sorta sleepy and tired all the time_ i have 2 aortic and mitral valve replaced (metal) then i started feeling jittery_ i gained weight and my heart condition seemed to get worse (i also have a pacemaker) and i thought it was because i didnt excercise enough. The doctors were puzzled yet they kept increasing my dose of toprol_ things kept getting worse_ they begun to suggest i get a heart transplant_ they went over these things with me_ i began to retain water_ things that never happened to me before. I was sleepy all day_ i stopped paying attention to world events_ became narrowly focused on little things_ attitude was withdrawn. then i stopped taking it on my own without telling my doctor_ he kept upping the dose and didnt even seem to notice i stopped. my stats got better but damage had been done to my tricuspid valve_ they wanted to do a transplant_ they salivated over the prospect_ i dropped them and moved on to different hospital_ this hospital changed my pace,I believe that Toprol-XL is a drug that makes your heart worse_ so that you will need to have a heart transplant. That may seem a bit harsh but it is my opinion. No matter how good or bad my condition the doctors push to raise the dose_ even after complaints of dizzyness and fatigue and symptoms of CHF that i never had before. If you take Toprol and it helps you_ fine_ if you start taking it_ write down your EF_ what your pulse rate is normally and blood pressure_ walk for 6 minutes and measure distance. If any of those things get worse_ tell your doctor you want off of this pill_ be straight with him_ and if he pushes you just stop taking it and watch his reaction when you get better_ he will try to push it up to a target of 200mg and once you have been there he will act piculiar when you dont feel worse. This pill is a scamI would like to know how many people have taken Toprol and within 2 years needed a heart transplant?,F,28,6  months,10/5/2006,Toprol-xl

Looking back I can remember being short of breath walking up the stairs to my condo.  More recently_ mowing the lawn wipes me out and I feel as if I am not taking in enough oxygen (no chest pain or wheezing).  Furthermore_ I was going the gym and had a personal trainer and had to stop.  I was getting nauseous_ light-headed_ and became extremely sore (for days) and fatigued (had to go home and sleep).,"The med has controlled the hypertension.  Originally on 100mg for about 10 days.

I am looking forward to getting off this drug and getting back to myself.  I am worried about the palpitations though.  The older I get the longer they last.

I guess we could increase the dose to get the pressure even lower_ but rather I am losing weight and exercising more.  Since I have a family history of hypertension_ even in normal weight relatives_ it is likely I will have to remain on the medication.

My stress test was normal so we went with the toprol-xl for my BP issues and crestor(which I did not take after reading about it).

For those of you on tons of drugs that get these 'drastic' side effects dont blame it on the ""last one added"" to your cocktail.  Drugs interact and the wrong combination can send some people right off the edge.

I am dosed at 25 mg though we may try 50 mg to achieve desired BP reseults.,"Here's what I believe.  I think people read the side effect profiles as listed on the accompanying prescription literature when picking meds up from the pharmacy.  Then_ because they have read this laundry list of side effects_ they have it in their minds that they are going to experience every single side effect.  This drug is NOT a cure all for mental instability folks.  It is a CARDIAC medication approved to control blood pressure among other cardiac indications.  If you are having mental issues_ you should consult a psychologist/ psychiatrist and perhaps try any one of the numerous drugs that are indicated for psychosis.  I think it is INSANE that people are going on about such side effects with this drug. I am certain that some folks may not respond well to this drug (or any drug for that matter)_ but people are so quick to jump on band wagons.

571, 1, BP 140 over 80_ angina (?) once,Have taken 50 mg. dose daily for 2 years. I thought I was lethargic and weak because of the aging process. I developed a hand tremor_ and have to wear socks to bed for my cold feet. My wife tells me that I have mood swings that I did not have before taking Toprol. I am unsteady on my feet. I have exercised all my life_ but with this drug_ I just don't feel like undertaking anything. I told my GP that I was feeling weak during my last physical_ and he told me that was a normal side effect for Beta Blockers. He did not want to discuss a change of diet_ or the importance of exercise_ or the fact that this drug has severely impacted my quality of life during the last two years. I am in the process of weaning myself to zero with this drug.,"Do not accept a prescription for this drug if you are not given a thorough briefing on side effects by the prescribing physician. I was just handed a piece of paper for Toprol and Lisinopril. Doctors should not be allowed to prescribe Toprol unless they have taken it themselves for a year. Let them see how it feels to try and get out of bed in the morning to go to the office. This drug only treats the symptoms and not the underlying causes_ so if you can manage to lower your BP through exercise or diet_ any positive results will be masked by the fact that you are taking Toprol. Every six months when I had an appointment with my cardiologist (resident)_ he would smile at the fact that my BP was below 140 and say_ ""Yep. It's working"". Don't trust these folks. They are working under insurance company protocols. A pill that treats the symptoms is cheaper than an angioplasty_ which could find a physical problem. An inconclusive treadmill test is cheaper than a 64 slice CAT scan_ w",M,67,2  years,11/5/2005Email,Toprol-xl

I am not big on medication_ so I only took 25 mg. Within a week_ my blood pressure was down. Eventually I noticed that my panic/anxiety also had decreased. I figured this was in my head. When I went back to the doctor and told her_ she said that this medication was used for anxiety too. I never knew that. Now_ I have lost 20 lbs. and exercise daily and my blood pressure is pretty low. But_ I am staying on this medication mainly for the anxiety.

Switched to Toprol because of an episode I had with rapid heart beat. My primary felt it was smarter to take a pill that would help with both. However a cardiologist that I had seen suggested just having a script for a pill(can't think of it's name--not trying to be funny!)_ that one takes when having an episode. I'm going to see about using that method and getting back on Accupril along with HCT which I'm still on anyway.

It also increased each time the doctor increased dosage. Another side effect was weight gain and hair loss. Couldn't sleep at night. Didn't feel like doing anything (very much unlike me!),When I was first put on Toprol XL the following week I had to go to the hospital by ambulence. My pulse was so bad the parametics had to shock my heart. Was in the hospital for a week (also had pnuemonia and oxygen count was low). Switched doctors but was still on Toprol. He increased med till I was eventually taking 125 mg. I was miserable. Fortunetly 125 mg is not a valid strength (he had me taking samples of 100mg and 25mg) so when I went to get perscription filled the pharmacy wouldn't do it. The doctor eventually switched me to another med and now I feel 100% better. I would also like to add that while on Toprol my BP went to 200/104 and that was at a high dose.

It's like what others are saying on this site....the weight stays and will not go away!  the other side effect that I notice and it probably why I'm so tired all the time is because of my constant runs to the bathroom to urinate....most times it's 2-3 times per night while I wake up from a deep sleep!  I feel sluggish_ lethargic and am smiling less each day because I think I'm depressed now too.,My high blood pressure is still high and I'm on 50mg once at bedtime.  My doctor is talking about a diuretic now but I won't take another medicine that is a result of a side effect from another.

Reduced Metoprolol on my own initiative GRADUALLY from 50mg to 25mg. Almost immediate result with much improved mood and return of old sleep patterns. Today my cardiologist scrapped the Metoprolol completely and advised depression is not as uncommon with beta-blockers as the studies indicate. Has prescribed additional hypertension medication_ but I am delighted to be off the beta-blockers.

After 6 hours of trying to bring my heart rate down with Ativan_ I was finally given 25mg of Toprol XL via IV - my heart rate at that time was 140_ it immediately dropped to 85.  Last night similar thing happened again_ I went to the ER with a severe panic/anxiety attack.  My BP was 167/135_ pulse 132 I was given 1 mg Ativan AND 25 mg Toprol XL within an hour my BP was 120/81 pulse 85.  I don't have any history of heart problems and am in good health.  I have always had severe anxiety and I feel this drug is great.

Other than that_ nothing at all. Plus side_ feel less anxious generally - more relaxed - calmer. My BP is good.,Frankly_ I love this medicine! I was having frequent chest pains and arrhythmias - my heart chambers do not pump synchronously and there is a lack of oxygenation. My doctor started me on 25mg but it wasn't quite doing it for me_ so he upped the dosage to 50mg and that pretty much takes care of it. When I drink too much coffee or drink coffee too late in the day_ or when I am under extreme physical or emotional stress_ I have felt some mild chest pain again but these are incidents I can control better myself. If anything_ adding another 25mg may be necessary at some point. But I wouldn't dare be without Toprol now. It's a lifesaver!,M,46,6  days,3/9/2005,Toprol-xl

My Dr. finally tried Toprol XL 25 mg. and it has seemed to cure me. My heart rate now_ is usually in the low 80's. It is true that this medication has to be taken everyday and my heart does remind me to take it_ by beating slightly faster. (90-100) I resisted this medication when first told to take it_ because the idea of a beta blocker caused me some concern_ but after doing some research and talking to my Dr._ I realized this medication is very safe. My father-in-law has been taking it for quite some time and he's 90 years old and doing really well.

I have gained weight since being on this medication_ easily 10 lbs or more.  I recently saw an allergist for respiratory problems and he suggested I come off the Toprol XL due to it being a beta blocker and recommended I try something else. I asked my cardiologist about it and he said it would be ok to just stop the Toprol XL but to monitor my BP. It has been only two days and I have had severe migraines since. Unable to control them. I used to suffer from them_ but don't recall having one since being on the Toprol XL. Now I realize how much I hated them.

Now I am on 100 mg. since they also put me on a channel blocker (verapamil 120mg) along with pravachol 80mg and zetia 10mg.  The toprol is a beta blocker and causes tiredness_ no libido_ some memory loss_ weight gain and HAIR LOSS.  The hair loss is terrible for men_ but try being a woman.  Doctor is aware of all these side effects but insists I take the 100 mg.  It is slowing my heartrate down to where it should be.  He refuses to take me off or even lower the dosage.  I also take an 81 mg. adult strength aspirin per day.  Had many other reactions to other meds.  These seem to be tolerated other than the side effects above.  No rashes_ no swelling_ no heart pain_ etc.,Everyone is different and should consult their physician on all side effects.  I exercise 4x a week to simply maintain my weight since this drug can pack it on.  OH....BEWARE OF IMITREX TOO.  i never smoked_ normal weight_ controlled BP...but still had a heart attack at 55 after a 50 mg. Imitrex.,F,56,14  months,1/9/2005,Toprol-xl

I have been on the medicine over a year and I've gained about 20 lbs.  The doctor is getting me off of the Toprol_ and he's prescribed a calcium channel blocker.  Does anyone have any info on these?  Good or bad?  I've read that a beta-blocker can react with a calcium channel blocker.  My cardiologist wants me to take 25 mg of toprol at night_ and the calcium channel blocker during the day.,I wish this medicine didn't have the side effects because it really did take care of my heart symptoms.

After a year the only problematic side effects I have noticed are hair loss (Anyone know if there's a way to fix that? Will it come back if I get off of it?)_ and now that I am exercising regularly my blood pressure and pulse have dropped even lower. I was told that if I stay on this exercise plan that I will eventually have to be taken off the dosage (25mg 2x daily)!,I know it's scary at first_ not understanding why your body is reacting the way it does to the medication_ but just stick with it and you'll probably feel much better very soon. And if anyone could help me with the hair loss thing-I really am not enjoying that aspect of it-and I know that I am experiencing an uncommon side effect_ but I just want to know exactly how much to expect to lose!,M,25,1  years,12/15/2004Email,Toprol-xl

So I went to 25mg./day (halving the tabs).  This was just as effective BP-wise and after about three weeks I felt 100% better_ like a fog and weight had been lifted off of me.  Then I got the diabetes diagnosis_ which in a way is a blessing because I'm off beta-blockers and much more active and happy.

720, 2, ventricular tachycardia_ pvc's,15 pound weigh gain over 3 years_ severe depression_ anxiety loss of interest and low energy_ feelings of hopelessness,At first it worked great to smooth out the pvc's. I feel that for some people this can be a very effective med. However_ over time I felt that it greatly increased my levels of depression and anxiety.  Also_  no matter what I ate I continued to gain weight.After seeing an electrophysiologist last month he recommended that I stop the Toprol. He diagnosed me with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia. My chiropractor told me before I started Toprol that he felt I was producing to much adrenaline and guess what?  That is exactly what the electrophysiologist thought as well. He felt that my particular condition was not life threatening and that I only needed the meds if my symptoms became bothersome. I feel that other issues need to be addressed in patients that have this kind of condition besides just what is happening with the heart itself. I feel that mine is related to the way I react to stress.  I would recommend to anyone that is on this medication that they pay attention to changes that they experience MENTALLY as well as physically.  I found out_ after I started taking it_ that Toprol can increase your chances of experiencing depression. It is also a good idea to make someone close to you aware of this because I did not realize how dramatic this was when it was happening to me. I would recommend that you wean yourself off of this and not stop abruptly which is what I am in the process of doing. Also_ don't stop taking meds without advice from a cardiologist as some of these arrythmias are life threatening even though mine turned out not to be.  I was taking 50mg and am down to 12.5. Like I said_ this did work in the beginning and not everyone has the same reaction to medication.  It's important to do your own research and pay attention to what your body is telling you!  Good Luck!,F,36,3  years,9/20/2004,Toprol-xl
