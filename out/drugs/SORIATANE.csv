1, 4, Post Transplt Sqamous Cell SKin CA,lips peeling_ hair curling_ mood changes_ fingernails thing cracking_ feet and hands peel_ lots of hair loss.,Have had several bouts_ where large areas became open_ like a burn that were in areas affected by the skin cancer. These areas take quite a long time to heal and have left some scaring in the areas.  I make quarterly trips to Dermatology_ so we can adjust dosing and treatment. I am certainly hoping to decrease this medication to the lowest effective dose possible!  It has been a journey for sure.,F,60,2.5  years50 1X D,6/29/2015,Soriatane

3, 5, Psoriasis,90% clear in two weeks,I cleared up very quickly. So much that I am taking a break from phototherapy to see if I can just use the drug to keep my skin clear. That being said_ I do not know if in the months to come I will experience any adverse effects. At the moment I have some dry lips and scalp_ but otherwise it's been great. I do miss beer_ though.,M,32,14  days10 MG 1X D,11/3/2014,Soriatane
4, 4, moderate psoriasis_,"Our daughter was getting married_ and I really wanted to clear my skin before the wedding.  I began taking Soriatane in October_ 2012_ and was probably about 90% clear for the wedding (the following March).  The side effects were tolerable for the first year_ and I was grateful for the clearing skin.  I had the usual: dry lips_ dry nose_ peeling feet_ cracking nails_ and hair loss. Also my skin became very thin_ and waxy. These things were all ""handle-able."" But over time_ I began to feel Soriatane was changing not only  the way I looked_ but the way I felt. My thick eyelashes were short and thin_ and my skin was changing color.  Also_ my nails became so thin I could hardly button things. My moods were sometimes blue_ and I was bothered by things that never before bothered me. This past February_ I went off the drug.  It's been about 4 mos now.  My hair is thicker_ but still curly.  My nails are thicker_ and my lips and nose are no longer dry.  I feel my vision is better also.",,F,55,16  months25 mg 1X D,6/16/2014,Soriatane

9, 3, ,Was taking 25mg every second day which did nothing.  Have been taking 20mg per day for 3 months along with UVB treatment. 95% clear.  Am thinking of stopping as hair is falling out and patches becoming bare.  Fingernails are soft and spliting below where they should be.,,F,53,6  months20mg 1X D,2/13/2012,Soriatane
10, 2, Psoriasis,I started at 20 MG a day and noticed little but steady improvment on the upper body. Then a rash broke out on upper legs_ which I never had before. It's a bit better_ but my lower legs persist with thick scales as if I never used the medication._ Some are a bit thinner with some more normal skin than beforeIsuppose. It definitely got 50% worse though after I started taking it. My Derm_ a national expert on the disease_ says it will take up to six months for full improvment. I wonder if there is a resistance to the drug after time since I took it many years ago with fast and nearly 100% success. The slower start and worsening may be attributable to the 20MG dosage for the first six weeks. I will up date in three months.,,M,60,2  months25 MG 1X D,11/27/2011Email,Soriatane
11, 1, Sebaceous Hyperplasia,My skin stared to peel_ then it got really bad on my feet.  My skin was coming of in sheets_ like a glove_ I could hardly walk or use any shoes. My hands were also peeling constantly and were red and the skin very thin.  It would start to heal and start all over again. I had red dry patches all over my body and a scaly scalp. My Dr. did not want me to get off the medication_ but it was affecting my work.,I just got off it compleatly and will not try it again_ plus it did nothing for my condition of Severe Sebaceous Hyperplasia.  6 years ago I used Acutaine and it worked from the first pill!,F,52,2  months50MG 1X D,10/7/2010,Soriatane
12, 2, Palmoplantar Pustular Psoriaisis,Hair Loss_ First lashes then eyebrows_ then hair. Rash over entire body that felt like sunburn. Extremely dry eyes ears_ nose_ mouth and lips. Nose bleed when blowing. Bum bleed when having a motion.,A scary drug for me. Didnt help at all. Specialist now has me on Methoblastin. Gee I pray that will work. Im so tired of not having my normal life and are scraed I may loose my job that I love and need! Sometimes I feel we are guinea pigs for the medical profession. After awhile it affects your mind. I'm so over it.,F,46,3.5  months50mg 1X D,10/2/2010Email,Soriatane
13, 4, Plaque Psoriasis,Extremely dry nasal passages_ face peeled the first month or so_ yellowish tint to skin_ thinning of skin_ extreme hair loss after about 5 months. Hated to stop because it cleared my skin completely other than my knuckles. Stopped taking it about 2 weeks ago because of hair loss and it is gotten worse since I stopped. I'm very scared that it won't stop.,I think that dermatologists should really let their patients know just how serious this drug is. I have mild to moderate psoriasis_ and don't feel that I was properly informed about this drug before I started taking it. If I has been told how strong of a drug Soriatane is I would have never taken it.,F,33,8  months25 mg 1X D,8/10/2010,Soriatane
14, 3, Psoriasis,AFter first month_ chapped lips that never got better.  After 5 months hair began falling out in clumps and thinning and was a coarse consistency,When my hair started falling out_ I stopped the RX.  Have to find another way to treat now.,F,56,6  months30mg 1X D,7/21/2010,Soriatane
15, 4, psoriasis on soles of my feet,dry lips_ dry eyes_ dry nasal passages_ very slight hairloss_,The drug has helped about 60% so far. No more painful fissures on my feet_ no more cracking_ bleeding. PS still visible. I do wonder if it compromises my immune system - having trouble shaking off colds_ catching more_ etc. Will continue - Dr. feels more progress is definitely possible.,F,65,4  months10mg 1X D,3/27/2010,Soriatane
16, 5, Psoriasis,Chapped lips_ dry mouth and dry nasal passages.,I battled plaque psoriasis for nearly 10 years with an endless number of nonprescription products combined with prescribed steroid cremes. The affected areas slowly got larger and became more numerous. Finally I agreed with the dermatologist to try Soriatane combined with biweekly sessions of UVB phototherapy. After approx. 14 weeks_ 90% of the psoriasis was gone. The knuckles required longer treatment_ but they are healing as well.For the scalp_ Head & Shoulders works fine followed with cocnut oil for moisturizing.,M,50,6  months,9/11/2009Email,Soriatane
17, 4, PRP pityriasis rubra pilaris,Muscle pain has persisted for the 4 months since I stopped taking it.  Chiropractic treatments didn't help and Physical Therapy actually made it worse.  Yoga is helping_ but it is a long road back to normal.  I also had almost nonexistent eyelashes and eyebrows_ but they are growing again.  The curly hair is kind of fun_ but the longer hairs are straight_ so my head is quite a sight to behold.,It worked great on my PRP and seems to have put it into complete remission_ which is wonderful.,F,55,4  months,7/1/2009,Soriatane
18, 3, Psoriasis on palms and soles,Severe hair loss_ changes in hair texture,Ugh.  I loved Soriatane.  The initial side effects others listed only lasted a few weeks for me.  And it worked miracles on my psoriasis.  But after about 9 months_ my hair started falling out in clumps.  I would hate getting in the shower...the drain would be filled with hair.  It was quite noticable and I was beginning to get thin patches on the top of my head and front.  Then my normally stick straight hair became curly and frizzy.  It was amazing_ actually.  And quite hideous_ too.  No one could explain it.  I did a lot of googling and finally found one or two reports that said curly hair is a rare side effect of the drug.  I finally stopped taking Soriatane without telling my derm.  The hair loss stopped after about 8 weeks_ and after 12 weeks I got a haircut and my straight hair was back.  Very disappointed because Soriatane worked very well for me.  My derm gave me a script for a lower dose (10mg_ I think) but I haven't started taking it yet.  I really don't want to go through t,F,57,1  years,12/6/2008,Soriatane
19, 4, Plaque soriasis,Chapped lips_ itchy skin (but not real bad)_ headaches_ nasal clogging_ thinning of skin_ face looks slightly jaundice.,The headaches went away after awhile.  My right nasal passageway stays clogged up all the time_ this may be due to allergies but I've never had allergies before.  The skin on and around effected area seems real thin after area heals.  When I look in mirror it kinda looks like i been sittin in a tanning bed_ that yellowish brown type of tan you get from a tanning bed.  The medicine is curing the psoriasis though_ it's been 2 months.  I still have patches on elbows thumbs and finger tips.  Once and awhile the skin on my fingers will crack and bleed but it's not as bad as it was.  I am on Soriatane for 3 months then I will get an eval to see if it is worth staying on it.  I have a feeling that Soriatane will not completly cure it for me but maybe it will make it so i can live with it.,M,49,2  months,9/4/2008Email,Soriatane
20, 4, Psoriasis,peeling on hands and feet. dry lips. easy blistering from running on feet so difficulty exercising.,I didn't find this medicine as effective as Cyclosporin but it's less harmful.  I would say my skin is 50% better than without taking it.  I've also found small amounts of sun help as my arms and legs are clearer than my body after I've been cycling round London in the summer sun.,M,31,8  days,8/4/2008Email,Soriatane

22, 4, PRP Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris,Blurred vision_ (gets worse as the day goes on).Headaches and dizziness.,"I had severe PRP over my entire body with skin coming off in layers. It was very painful_ (I understand my pain level was uncommon)_ and horribly itchy. The SORIATANE has helped and now my body is just ""dusty"" rather than shedding layers upon layers of skin. My feet and palms are pretty bad_ but overall there is improvement. The pain and itch is tolerable now. I'm concenred about the blurred vision and dizziness_ but more concerned about the PRP coming back full force if I stop the SORIATANE. good luck all!!",M,48,50  days,5/28/2007Email,Soriatane
