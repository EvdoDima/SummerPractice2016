0, 2, Nasal congestion,Gave me a headache. After a few days I began feeling cranky all  the time. After a couple of weeks I realized it was making me feel progressively more and more angry.  Side effects stopped immediately on stopping medication. Same thing happened when I re-tried the medication. It made me feel extremely angry.,It does clear up nasal congestion_ but not worth the side effects.,M,70,2  weeks 2X D,7/31/2014,Nasarel
1, 3, nasal inflammation,Thinning hair_hair loss_slight burning that lasted only seconds.,Although this did work for me i will find another alternative as my hair is falling out more than regular...more than the standard 50 to 100 strands daily as they say.,F,47,4  days29mcg 1X D,12/4/2011Email,Nasarel

3, 4, Mucus in throat_ due to allergies,Runny nose...Need to have tissue handy.,I think it works pretty well.  Relieves my ears from time to time by pushing the mucus down to my throat.  When this does not work_ have to use Prednisone from time to time,F,27,1  years,1/14/2010,Nasarel
4, 3, Chronic sinusitis,Very runny nose for 20-30 minutes after use. Slightly bothersome were the burning sensation and nasty_ bitter_ chemical taste as it runs down the throat. I also seemed to have a sore_ dry scratchy throat afterward.,"I experienced some relief throughout the day but this is not ""curing"" me and the side effects are as unpleasant as the stuffy nose. I would rather suffer with a natural condition than a chemically induced one in the long run.",F,39,3  months,7/6/2009,Nasarel
5, 4, nasal congestion,None,Works pretty darn well.,M,65,3  years,12/24/2008,Nasarel
6, 4, sinusitis,Made me feel tired after repeated use.  My doctor says that it runs the adrenal glands down.  Have used it on a limited basis since then.  It works where Flonase and Nasanex don't.  Nasarel works within hours for me or it doesn't work at all.  Don't have to take it for several weeks to get results.,If Nasarel doesn't work for me then I usually have to resort to the 12 hour spray.  I try to avoid the 12 hour spray since it can raise your blood pressure.,M,60,50  times,3/11/2008,Nasarel

18, 1, allergies,I started this drug 3 days before a trip to visit inlaws in Russia with husband and kids.  Cleared allergies_ but lost sense of smell. Once I got there_ could not sleep even after rest of family adjusted_ started having panic attacks (for only 3rd time in life)_ and 2 days into the trip thought I was having a nervous breakdown.  Inlaws very worried their son married a madwoman.  My skin was crawling_ had burning sensations - I misdiagnosed as coming off the xanax i had taken on the flight_ and to try to sleep...  Went off Nasarel and symptoms disappeared after about 3 more days.  Ruined first week of 2 week trip.,Apparently this med affects people very differently.  My drug inserts did not mention anxiety or I would have been on guard.  I admit I am a little prone to enxiety_ but this was very extreme.  I had a hard time figuring out the problem because of the trip and time change_ and thought maybe I had emotional issues with the inlaws....  But the second week my symptoms had magically disappeared.  Very scary because I thought I was crazy.,F,35,8  days,7/8/2006,Nasarel
19, 5, Seasonal Allergies,The only side effect I noticed was the burning after inhaleing.  Maybe a headache.,This medicine has helped clear my nose any my ears.,M,27,3  years,6/26/2006,Nasarel
20, 4, allerlgies,the only side effect I've experienced is that my nose runs like crazy for about 10 mins. after using Nasarel,for me_ the allergy control has been great. Even now (Spring) I'm only taking an antihistamine approx. 1/week - previously on Flonase I had to add antihistamine every day. I'm very happy w/Nasarel so far.,F,59,4  months,6/1/2006,Nasarel
21, 1, Allergies,anxiety_ sleeplessness_ horrible nightmares_ depression,After taking Nasarel for about a week_ I felt very anxious all the time_ would wake up early every morning (2 or 3 a.m.) feeling anxious and unable to get back to sleep. When I did sleep_ I had horrible_ vivid nightmares...every night. I usually either don't dream_ or don't remember dreams_ so this was extremely unusual. Also got a bit depressed_ also not usual for me. Symptoms stopped very quickly after stopping the Nasarel. I would NOT take this again. Doctor has now prescribed Flonase_ and after the first dose I am already feeling anxious...After reading the comments on this site_ I may just give up and suffer w/ the allergies. These side effects aren't worth it.,F,40,14  days,4/24/2006,Nasarel
