1, 3, Glaucoma,Works good except for occasional bad batches.,I have been using Trusopt for a number of years and it does a good job in keeping the eye pressure down.  But_ I have just had what I call a bad batch.  Eye pain when changing focus to near objects.  Renewed prescription and everything back to normal.  First time this happened about a year ago I wrote to Merck.  They replied that their lab would investigate and a month later another letter from them said that they found nothing wrong with the drops.,M,55,5  years,3/2/2009,Trusopt

3, 3, Open Angle Glaucoma,Stinging shortly after putting the drops in.,After initial stinging I have no other side effects and my eyes feel morre comfortable than with any other eye drops I have used.
