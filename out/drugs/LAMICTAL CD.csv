0, 5, bipolar_ mood stability,"At first I was slightly drowsy in the morning. I am having trouble with my knees ""falling out"" which started around the same time I started my lamictal.  .",Has anyone encountered a similar situation? Beside my knees_ which could be due to anything (don't want to blame the drug) BUT lamictal absolutely saved my life and the ones around me. I was a mess_ post partum_ bipolar_ anxiety_ depression_ manic. It has literally saved me! I am SO HAPPY my doctor prescribed this medication for me.,F,27,4  years200 mg,6/9/2015,Lamictal cd

2, 5, depression with severe mood swings,I have a slight case of lamictal brain-fuzz. My memory is a little worse and I have trouble spelling when I didn't before_ but it is mild.,I've been cycling through depression meds for 7 years. I used to have extremely bad mood swings that were uncontrollable...I could go from happy to extremely depressed or irritated in a matter of minutes. I felt horrible because the slightest thing could set a mood swing off_ like a ripped pair of jeans. Lamictal has been a godsend and has helped in a way no other medication has. I hope I never have to stop taking it; I am still depressed at times but it is milder and now my moods are mostly stable and my life isn't being taken over by my mental illness.,F,26,6  months100mg,2/20/2015,Lamictal cd
3, 1, Mood Swings,This drug has made my asthma horrible. My rescue inhaler barely helps. This made my mood swings worse and my anxiety 10 times worse. I've also had a few panic attacks.

4, 5, Bipolar,This medication has saved my marriage. I was a mess before I started taking it. I picked fights with my husband constantly. Finally_ he told me he couldn't take it anymore and was considering leaving. I knew at that point that if I wanted our marriage to work_ I was going to have to get help. My doctor put me on Lamictal and within days I noticed an improvement in my mood. I'm not 100%_ but I am much better off than I was before I started taking it. I have a lot going on in my life_ including the loss of loved ones and dealing with several medical issues with myself as well as my children...some of these issues are progressive and incurable. Lamictal has helped me deal with everything head on_ instead of curling up in a ball crying and being unable to face life. I can finally be strong for my family. Things could not be better between my husband and I. We get along great and we're finally able to give our children the loving_ stable environment they deserve. I will never stop taking this medication. As far as side effects_ if I have any_ they have been so mild that I haven't even noticed them. Yes_ some people do have unpleasant side effects_ but that's a possibility with every medication out there...even Tylenol. What works for some_ clearly does not work for others. You'll never know if this will be a right fit for you unless you give it a chance. It's worth a try_ in my opinion. ,,F,35,1  years100 MG,5/18/2014Email,Lamictal cd

7, 1, BIPOLAR AND ADHD,This drug made me stare out of the window_ non social_ people kept telling me I was not myself  and asking me what was wrong and I did not feel like myself. I was not thinking at all. There are alot of people who do not know I am adhd or bipolar_ they just think I am a get her done type of person and am very social. Limictal with paxil made me a zombie_ did not feel comfortable_ my stomache always hurt- would try to make it feel better by eating_but that did not help. I forget all of my symptoms but I felt as if I were dying. I also have never had gory and mutilation dreams_ being scared and trying to run away. I started having horrible seeming so real nightmares. I am thinking that I was misdiagnosed as bipolar and I am only adhd. Both run in my family and I did tell the dr. I went to that I don't believe I have strong bipolar symptoms. I know what a person acts like and the symptoms from speaking with 2 of my sisters that have bipolar.

9, 5, bi polar II,I have had no side effects what so ever. This medication is like the missing link in my brain.,"I got a diagnosis of bi polar II disorder in 2005. I have been treated for depression only in the past...unaware that the ssri's would make me hypomanic. Lamictal has helped me so much. It evens out my moods_ which for the most part is good. I also take celexa. They even out my moods and dull them a bit_ but it is better then crying all the time_ insomnia_ paranoia_ and rage. It sucks having to be on medication. I wish I could go off them and be a normal person_ because I have had periods in my life when I was ""normal"" but if I miss even a single dose I am struggling to function and if I miss a few days my world literally falls apart_ can't work or function around people. Anyway_ it has helped me a lot and it has helped me stay sober. Haven't had a drink in almost 6 years. ",F,48,5  years200mg 1X D,4/27/2012Email,Lamictal cd
10, 2, Bipolar II with mixed states,Inability to orgasm_ problems with talking_ eyesight changes_ confusion_ short term memory loss_ trouble sleeping,"All in all_ this drug has been a godsend for me and my relationships.  While I'm still struggling to become a better person_ this drug has removed quite a few roadblocks.  I have side effects and they definitely bother me after having been on the drug for a few years_ so I'm considering weening off after speaking to my doctor.  Two years ago you might have found me either exercising or crying uncontrollably any giving time of the day_ even at work on breaks_ but now I'm a pretty well adjusted person who's finally calmed down enough to pursue some interests other than drinking and laying around watching tv.  From what I've read about lamictal_ it's nothing you want to stay on long term_ especially if you having side effects.  As far as side effects go_ (and pardon_ i'm in a hypomanic state atm) I tend towards mixing up my words_ forgetting what i'm saying midsentence (which makes me look like a total DA at work)_ I have swirly and sometimes static like vision_ especially when I'm looking at bright objects like the sky and the computer.  I have residual images constantly_ I have a hard time getting my brain to ""work"" sometimes_ like during math_ and some trouble sleeping.  I also have stiff muscles and find myself clenching my entire body during the day and at night.  So basically_ it's worsened the normal effects of hypomanic states in bipolar disorder_ in many ways_ while keeping me completely level headed about it_ if that makes sense.",F,24,2  years50 1X D,2/21/2012Email,Lamictal cd
11, 1, Bi-Polar,"Feelings of indifference_ increased disasociation with reality_ irrational thoughts sometimes stemming from ""lucid dreams"" that he is certain mean something. Sporatic and unpredictable aggresion accompanied by severe shaking. Disreguard for responsibilities. Warped sence of invincibility. Increased confusion and inability to cope with distractions.","I am writting this on behalf of my husband as a warning to other concerned spouses/children/partners/parents out there that are experiencing_ second hand_ the negative side effects that this drug may be having on their loved one. After my husband began taking Lamictal he started feeling ""better"" quickly. This led to sudden thoughts that he is in his right mind and should be focusing on him and his needs while his children and wife sit on the sidelines. He has now lost his wife and children and beleives that it is a good thing. He has left the house and is only paying for his room and board where he is staying and refuses to pay the bills he left with his wife and children. This is all very recent and who is to know if he will remain happy with these changes but he has very limited interaction with his children at this point and the effects on them have been huge. It does appear that he feels better but from what I see it is only better because he isn't reguarding any of the responsibilities that he has. Only time will tell how he responds when reality hits him but from what I have seen so far he will continue to withdrawl. He refuses to listen to my feedback about his treatment and has concocted a grand story in his mind that I am the root of his anger issues and with out me he will now be better. He has taken this to the extreme of simplifying our seperation saying that I just didn't want him to go hiking so I ended our seven year relationship and tore our children",F,32,3  months100 MG 1X D,7/11/2011Email,Lamictal cd

14, 4, Bipolar I_ Hypomania & Depression,None at first_ spontaneous and rapidly worsening symptons after 8 months.,"After months of severe insomnia_ suicidal thoughts_ etc. lamictal was a godsend. Within a couple weeks my entire life turned around. No significant side effects_ but I generally don't get side effects. It continued to work through the summer_ wasn't affected by any pain killers from a few surgeries. What really made me realize it's full effect was how well it worked during a really disastrous breakup. Never been so sad in my life_ but I was able to function_ go to school_ etc. I didn't have any suicidal thoughts like I would have had in the past. Mid-October_ it suddenly stopped. It started with insomnia_ restlessness_ crying all the time_ inability to finish work_ lack of motivation_ couldn't get out of bed_ extreme hunger_ etc. I was put on 300 mg... no change. I started getting weird anxious energy_ like... when I was upset or stressed I started acting ""scary."" Spontaneous_ very neurotic reactions to little things. Inability to connect to emotions_ connect to physical actions. I'm so glad someone else reported this: weird_ compulsive head-scratching. And my shoulders and collar bones. I picked at my skin until I had little scabs like bugbites_ but I never realized it. I displayed all the symptoms of public anxiety but never ever felt paranoid or anxious. This December it's continued to get worse_ severe depression and listlessness_ crazy insomnia_ apathy... I started Seroquell XR which was miserable.

He had me taking alprazolam_ ambien_ xanax and adderall all at the same time.( WTF? )Before that I had tried lorazepam_ Lexapro and Cymbalta. Nothing worked.  The thought was that my anxiety was triggering depression and I couldn't focus so I took something for that_ and then I needed something to make me sleep. Didn't work. I was total zombie for months and I was suicidal. Up and down.. I was scared and paranoid all the time. I felt so terrible I wanted to die. I found a new doctor who put me on Lamictal. It completely evened me out and I felt like a human again. The anxiety I had was gone and I was so happy to have my life back. It really seemed like a miracle drug. HOWEVER... a few months ago I started experiencing joint pain and swelling. My knees give out. I sometimes have to walk backwards up the stairs and I am not over weight. I can hardly get out of bed in the morning. My feet turn inward - cant put them flat on the floor. I feel like someone threw me down the stairs when I wake up and I have a hard time gripping things. An example: I was carrying a gallon of water into the house and when I sat it down sharp pains started shooting up my arm. After just a short bike ride my knees give out and my wrists hurt.

32, 3, Depressive Bipolar II,Inability to focus vision on fine details_ some discoordination with fine motor tasks_ abnormal liver functions_ high triglycerides and cholesterol_ and CRIPPLING BACK PAIN.,I was excited to try this med as_ like many people with BPD_ I have a hard time taking SSRIs. It's claimed to be more effective against depressive episodes than more regularly prescribed BPD meds like Lithium_ and it was. However_ I gradually developed back pain during the slow dose increase used to start this medication. It started as a slight stiffness in my back_ and I assumed I was just out of shape. Then it became painful_ and I assumed I had hurt my back somehow_ but didn't think the Lamictal had anything to do with it. By the time I got to 200mg_ I was basically crippled and wondered each time I bent over whether that would be the time I wouldn't be able to stand back up- at 37 and fairly healthy_ I knew something was wrong. In spite of pointing this out to various doctors and nurses_ none of them seemed to make the connection_ and it wasn't until I did my own research that I found that a VERY HIGH NUMBER of people have similar complaints_ something like 1 in 12. At 200mg I had my blood checked_ which revealed abnormal liver functioning_ and high triglycerides and cholesterol. The doctors (all psych trained) didn't find that odd either. I have stopped taking the med and hope that sometime in the next month or so my back will recover and that the damage isn't permanent. So PLEASE recognize that your doctors are not all-knowing gods_ and that the side effects of this med can creep up on you VERY slowly.,M,37,3  months,8/23/2009,Lamictal cd

Quick mood swings on the first day which I found interesting. I was laughing and crying at the same time. My moods started to calm down. Instead of quick mood swings....I would have a bad mood one day and good mood the next day. Always felt aggitated and irritable at night. I had to take 2mg of Clonzepam to get me to sleep. Felt my skin itching but no visible rash. That sensation disappeared after I got into my new dose level and it started again when the pdoc increased my dose. I felt he moved me too quickly into the dosages. First two week 25 mg_ the 2nd two weeks 50mg_ the 3rd dosage was increased to 100 mg for three weeks. I did felt it stabilized my moods but the initial dosages made very tired and it was hard to concentrate at times when people talked to me but that slowly cleared up. Experienced some headaches. Experienced in the sixth week some twitching at night in my limbs. Felt dizzy at times.Noticed in the seventh week motor agitation which came in spurts and came throughout the day. Also had trouble with my gait but nothing real serious. None of this effected my driving ability. I did experience flu systems which the pdoc thought was the regular flu. I thought it was the meds....then I broke out in hives. Pdoc told me to stop ASAP.  When the rash reached my face I went to the emergency room. Got a quick dose of allergy steriods and diphenhydramine. Took a whole week for my rash to clear up.,F,52,49  days,7/10/2009Email,Lamictal cd

The stuff had horrible side effects including what I have on Lamictal and more.  I could not function on my job and still had seizures.  My doctor put me on Lamictal and I take it 3 times a day - 150 mg AM/PM and 100 at lunch.  I figured out I had seizures in the late afternoon so the lunch dose is just a little push to get me to my night time dose.  I've been seizure free for 5 years this April.That said_ sometime the side effects are pretty bad. They seem to improve or get worse with hormonal changes.  I get frustrated at the lack of strong feelings but I'm on this drug for the side effect of controlling seizures rather than the primary intention of helping bipolar.  So_ I should expect no strong feelings since it is a mood controlling drug.  However... I miss them.

The first month it felt like it had completely chanaged my life.  I was happier and higher on life than ever!  Unfortunately that didn't last.  My depression came back in full furry_ but the hypomania didn't.  So basically I felt like crap all the time.  And now sleeping problems and weight gain have become issues.  I go for days without sleeping_ but its not that I am not tired_ my body just can't sleep_ so I am sluggish and withdrawn during the day.  Kind of sucks. But_ it has only been four months_ so maybe it can still work for me.  Last time I visited the psych_ she bumped me up from 100mg to 150mg and reminded me that it was important to take the meds.  Its not like I wasn't before_ I just don't like taking them. . . but apparently I am a suicide risk_ so people get all freaked if I don't take them.  I don't know.

42, 4, Bipolar II,"Appetite loss_ blurred vision_ dizzy_ ""high"" feeling at first",The appetite loss has been the most severe side effect (which I dont mind_ I've lost 5 pounds so far)_ but the other side effects are eliminated completely by exercising immediately after taking the pill. I'm fortunate that I was already working out regularly before taking this medication_ but I strongly recommend trying to exercise (even walking) if one were struggling with side effects. It works for me. The drug seems to be clearing my mind as I increase the dosages (started at 25 mg_ then 50_ etc.). I played the violin when I was young and at a very definite point about 10 years ago seemed to lose my ability. Luckily I kept my violin because I seem to have picked up where I left off 10 years ago! Could be coincidental? Feel free to email me.,F,28,4  weeks,11/2/2008Email,Lamictal cd

Been to Cleveland - Pittsburgh had spinal epidurals_ facet injections_ MRI_ bone scans_ spect scan_ steroid inj_ physical therapy_ labwork_ took many meds -put on Enbrel IM Injections for 3 mo hoping he might have arthritis.

VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY which causes high blood pressure_ elevated triglycerides_ elevated ionized calcium /PTH_ fractures AND MORE. Tapering off. Doc started 50_000IU vit D wkly. and 1000mg calcium daily. BE CAREFUL. Vit D Deficiency is serious. Have your blood checked.

I've tried other stabilizers_ lithium_ Valproate_ Tegretol_ but I couldn't stand the side effects and they just didn't seem to work. I hated the sense of emotional detachment from everything and everybody lithium gave me. Lamictal seems to give a very slight detachment_ but in a helpful way. My moods aren't all over the map day to day and through the day. I finally feel stable_ normal. I can deal with everyday living and not feel like I can't live in my own skin.

It have noticed if I forget to take a pill that I start to become irritable again by very trivial matters.  I am also on Wellbutrin SR 300mg and Effexor (which I am being taken off of as its not working anymore).  The wellbutrin helped with energy because I was a tired depressive person and the Lamictal made my moods stable.  So I actually like the medicine just hate the Memory loss.

But the side effects like the stumbling for words and blurred visionn bothered me_ so I don't think I ever got enough of a dose to really tell if it would help for mood stabilization.

After 48 hours I suffered terrible vision problems and headaches.  I called the doctor's office.  I was told there was no way possible that it was the meds and to continue taking them.  I was told it would reduce my pain significantly. HA.  It reduce everything BUT my pain level.  On the fourth day I was experiencing comatose symptoms for the first 4 hours.  Then followed by 4 hours of hallucinations_ ranting_ raving_ pacing_ and uncontrollable crying....not to mention severe insomnia.  I know what it feels like to be litterally losing your mind.  My husband called the doctor to tell him of my side effects.  The doctor told him there was no way that could happen and to take me to our local psych hospital.  Funny...never was psychotic prior to taking this med_ and even funnier_ wasn't psychotic when I took myself off.  It wasn't me.  It was the pills.

I have tried seven anti-depressants_ Wellbutrin twice. They would kind of work for a short time on the maximum doses but then the depression would fade back in. My doc talked me into trying Lamictal 7 weeks ago and this is the first time_ in a long time_ I can say ""I feel Good"". The depression lifted after taking Lamictal for 4 days. I feel I can focus better at work and have more energy. I am taking 50mgs morning and night and 200mgs of Wellbutrin SR. This is working for me but if it doesn't for you_ don't give up. There is one or a combination of drugs that can help.

I started with Wellbutrin XL 300mg for moderate depression & work related stress_ then several months after starting the Wellbutrin_ my doctor added 100mgof Lamictal. I recently wen to 200mg per day.  Lamictal made a very big difference in my mood and ability to deal with stressfull situations.  Prior to Lamictal_ a stressfull situation_ at work or home_ frequently would trigger internal rage_ and the rage would ruin my day_ put me in a faul mood_ etc.  Lamictal really helped.  I did not want to think that I was bipolar_ afterall_ I am 43 years old_ a succesfull executive with a wife and three childres_ a scout leader_ etc. but_ based on the positive change this drig has made in my life_ I guess I must be bipolar.  The only reason a I gave it a 4 rather than a 5 is because after about 12 months of use_ I had to double my dose from 100mg to 200mg per day_ as I slowly started to feel my rage-reaction creeping back into my life.,,43,1  years,12/16/2006,Lamictal cd

118, 1, bipolar,WARNING - IF YOU GET *ANY* RASH_ DISCONTINUE IMMEDIATELY.  THE RASH ITSELF IS NOT LIFE-THREATENING BUT IT IS *INDICATIVE* OF SOMETHING POORLY UNDERSTOOD BUT POTENTIALLY LETHAL GOING ON IN THE BODY. (OK if you get a little heat rash_ that's one thing....) I CONSULTED THREE PHYSICIANS ABOUT DELETERIOUS SIDE-EFFECTS (psychiatrist_ internal med doc_ dermatologist) WHO ALL NEGLECTED GSK'S FRONT PAGE WARNINGS.  WHEN THE PHYSICIANS WERE SHOWN THE EXACT BOLD-PRINT WARNINGS SPECIFIED BY GSK THEY ALL DISREGARDED THE WARNINGS AND ADVISED I CONTINUE ON THE MEDICATION.  AS A RESULT THE DRUG NEARLY KILLED ME.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT NO ONE IS ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE A GOOD RASH FROM A BAD ONE.  PHYSICANS ARE IN GENERAL POORLY TRAINED AT IDENTIFYING DRUG-RELATED PROBLEMS_ PARTICULARLY AUTOIMMUNE ONES.  I KNOW BECAUSE I AM ONE.  WE ARE SPOON-FED NEW MEDS AND FALSELY TRUST IN WHAT HAS BECOME AN INSUFFICIENT DRUG SAFETY TESTING SYSTEM.

119, 1, Bipolar rapid cycling,slow buildup of severe autoimmune problems that went undetected by three different physicians.  first I started getting rashes and boils.  I developed asthma.  Vertigo.  Open sores on my scalp.  Severe allergies.  In the last six weeks of taking it I developed an ulcer in my bladder and suffered a sinus infection that beat out some of the strongest antibiotics known.  Sinus infections that keep swelling and keep beating antibiotics This drug would have likely killed me if I didn't have the professional expertise I have to determine the source of my problems.,Various autoimmune-like symptoms continue even 18 months after discontinuing lamictal.  I still suffer asthma attacks and rashes.  No history of asthma_ rashes_ sores_ etc._ before the drug but they are all part of my daily life now.  Other minor chronic problems I had before taking the lamictal (urinary/bladder_ allergies) have been permanently exacerbated it seems.  Discontinuing the drug did cause the sinus infection and inflammation to go away--within 36 hours.  Lamictal was incredibly effective for bipolar disorder for me_ particularly because it induced no cognitive deficits and I have a mentally highly-demanding job.  The stuff works.  But it is also dangerous to the point that it is deadly.  Word has it that the manufacturer of lamictal is internally and secretly investigating claims that it causes asthma.  Anyway_ killing a patient is not the best way to rid someone of a disease.  It sort of defeats the purpose.
