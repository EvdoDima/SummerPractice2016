0, 5, Migraine,When the first few times I started taking it I would get a stomach ache. That doesn't happen any more. I do get an elevated temp and feel like the room is too hot for the first few hours. Also_ I feel like I have a sunburn if I take a shower it can be uncomfortable. Very minor side effects.,Frova has changed my life. I have a real life now with a full time job. I was unable to hold a job for long and had to find alternative work getting jobs here and there because who wants someone to work for them that is gone 2 to 3 times a week. Once I started taking Frova I now can feel a migraine coming on while at work and if I take it there is no interruption. I can continue one with my day. I have tried other triptans and none of them actually take the migraine away they may knock it down some but your day is still ruined. Frova is a miracle for me.,F,43,9  years2.5 1X AN,4/27/2016,Frova
1, 5, Hormonal Headaches,Joint pain_ head buzzing_ and muscle pain. Side effects only developed after taking it for three years.,Frova saved my life. I used to down too many Extra Strength Excedrins to get the pain under control.  Tried everything OTC. Luckily_ this was the first drug my neurologist offered me. Every month I take it for a day or two_ and it kicks in quickly.,F,47,2  days2.5 mg 1X D,2/11/2016,Frova
2, 4, 24h migraine crisis 10+/month,None,Long 1/2 life. Quite efficient as pain-killer. The crisis is much less painful_ but still tiring.,M,53, 2_5MG 1X D,6/4/2015EmailHistory,Frova
3, 5, i get menstral headaches,none,I take it when I get a headache related to my  cycle and it goes away completely within 30 min. it really has been a life changer for me. I have been taking it for abou 3 years now. I only have to take one pill per month to make the headache go away. it has changed my life.,F,44,1  days30 1X D,1/30/2015,Frova
4, 5, Migraine,None,This is a miracle drug for me_ stops my migraine in its tracks.  I get migraines related to my menstrual cycle -2 a month that used to last 2-4 days each_ but since taking Frova I have had only one that lasted that long_ when I waited too long to take it. Frova will stop the migraine within 30 minutes if taken as soon as the pain starts_ it has changed my life.,F,,12  months 1X AN,10/9/2014,Frova
5, 4, Migraines,Dizziness_ nausea_ tingling_ feeling cold and sleepy.,This medication has worked well in relieving my migraines with one or two doses. The side effects are worth the pain relief.,F,45,  1X D,3/23/2014Email,Frova
6, 4, Migraines,"The most common side effect for me is joint ""stiffness"" for a few hours after taking Frova. It works within 20-30 minutes_ during this time I feel a little tingling sensation in my temples and my head. After that_ usually the migraine pain is gone_ but I have the strong urge to urinate. Once I do that and yawn (to relieve jaw stiffness)_ I'm good to go. I've been using Frova for 7 years now and for about 2 years now I notice that after taking it_ I get mild to moderate muscle and joint pain from head to toe_ which is a little unusual. I'm very stiff for a few hours afterward.","Frova is the only medicine that has helped me. I usually get migraines monthly_ mainly right before menstruation_ but I do get them occasionally with stress or after eating certain foods. I tried other brands for years_ in varying strengths and forms_ but they were not very effective for me. I like that I can take Frova at the moment I feel the ""aura"" of a migraine and within 30 minutes it's gone and I usually do not have to take it again. For me_ it's mild_ but long acting_ so I can take it even while driving or at work and it doesn't affect my abilities. For other meds_ I used to take them and have to sit in a dark room and put my head down for a while and pray that it would work_ which for the most part did not or it would_ but then the pain would come back a short while afterward.",F,44,7  years2.5mg 2X M,2/19/2014,Frova
7, 2, migraines,I was taking this for over a year and my Nuerologist thought it is great. Every time I had taken it_ I've had to go to either 1) get a torodal shot_ 2) get IV infusions_ 3) get put on steroids with it_ 4) take 2 doses and aleve_ or 5) all of the above. Hate it. Obviously seeing another dr now! Doesn't work.,,F,39,1  years2.5,1/7/2014,Frova
8, 2, migraines,this drug didn't do one thing to alleviate my migraine_ I might as well have taken a sugar pill,,F,62,2  days2.6 1X D,9/10/2013Email,Frova
9, 1, Menstrual Migraines,Mood swings_ irritability_  confusion_ unable to think clearly_ or remember what people were saying to me.,I was prescribed Frova from my neurologist for menstrual migraines.  I was instructed to take one Frova daily_ starting one day before the start of my period and to keep taking it until my period ended.  About day 2 of taking this medication_ I noticed I didn't like how my mind was feeling.  I couldn't think clearly.  My husband and kids would be talking to me about something and it was hard for me to remember what they were telling me.  I also found I was extremely irritable.  However_ it did work for getting rid of any sign of headache - which was wonderful!  4 days into my period_ I had to stop it because of how it was making me feel.  I am at day 5 now_ and I think the drug is still slowly leaving my system!  I can't wait until it is out of me! I won't be taking this again.  I will take a headache over this any day. Sorry makers of Frova. I am sure this is a blessing for some people.,F,46,7  days2.5 MG 1X D,8/9/2013Email,Frova
10, 5, Migraine,None,Most effective triptan so far because of its longer half-life.  One 2.5 mg dose usually gets rid of most of my migraines especially if taken early in the attack. On a couple of occasions_ the migraine came back after around 16 hours; a second dose of 2.5 mg was then sufficient to clear it completely.,F,42,1  years2.5 mg 1X D,11/24/2012,Frova
11, 1, Migraines,"Immediate effects: clearing of blurred vision; elimination of dull thudding pain.After 30 minutes: insomnia_ shakiness_ jittery_ talkativeDuration of 48 hours: muscular ""knots_"" joint aches_ nausea_ diahrrea_ hunger -- all too extreme to warrant taking this medicine.",This medicine was given to me as a sample medication by my neurologist to try.,F,60,1  days2.5 1X D,7/27/2012Email,Frova
12, 5, migraines,None.  Best triptan I've ever used.  Imitrex made me feel worse_ Maxalt made me fall asleep.  Frova let's me take it and forget about it.,I've had migraines for 15 years.  In the last 2 years I've tried almost every triptan_ antidepressants_ occipital nerve blocks_ you name it.  Those got my migraines down to just monthly_ during that time of the month.  I used to use Maxalt to treat the migraines as they came_ but that stopped working after about 6 months.  Now I take Frova as soon as my cycle starts_ 1 a day for 5 days.  I also take magnesium during those 5 days.  I've been migraine free for three months.  That's the longest I've gone without one in years.,F,28,3  months2.5 1X O,5/8/2012Email,Frova
13, 5, Migraine,None so far. Best migraine med I have taken. Others made me feel weird_ drowsy or throat closing up.,,F,40,1  days2.5,4/25/2012,Frova
14, 4, Migraines,Tingling of skin in warm water like a sunburn. Fatigue. 2-3 hours to start working_ but strong enough to get rid of the migraine for at least 24 hours. No weight gain noticed here.,I switch between this and Maxalt. I love Maxalt since it is quick_ but Frova is stronger and better at preventing rebound headaches.,M,33,6  months5 MG 1X D,1/23/2012Email,Frova
15, 3, Migraine relief,Heart palpitations_ initial restlessness_ frustration from waiting for its peak plasma levels to be reached (3-4 hours after ingestion of drug).  Better side-effect profile than other Triptans_ but I wasn't that thrilled.  Also_ my doctor friend told me Frova was the worst weight gainer out of all triptans.  Screw that.,Only use I got out of it was usually to sleep!  I have trouble falling asleep_ staying asleep_ and sleeping long enough (usually sleep for 4 hour intervals then nap; when on zero medication I could stay up (involuntarily) for probably at least 3-4 days without nodding off.  Anyway_ Frova is a triptan with a mild side-effect profile; downsides are the 3-4 hours it takes to reach peak effectiveness_ COST COST COST (omg this med is SO expensive)_ and the fact that it causes weight gain (not for everyone_ probably a small percentage of people).  But be aware that_ long-term_ daily or near-daily use might cause weight gain.,F,28,8  months 1X D,11/16/2011Email,Frova
16, 5, Migraine,Sleepiness_ aching fingers/joints_ tight throat when swallowing.,This drug is the best triptan I've taken for migraine. It lasts a long time preventing recurrence of my migraine. Takes about an hour and a half to work but well worth the wait. Side effects are minor compared to the crazy/scary side effects of sumatriptan and maxalt. This drug does not have the high rate of adverse effects_ especially on the heart_ that imitrex (sumatriptan) and other first generation triptans have. Great drug!,F,39,5  months2.5mg 1X AN,4/20/2011Email,Frova
17, 4, Migraine,Very drowsy_ loopy feeling for about 2 hours once it kicks in; very tight throat; aching joints - particularly fingers_ feet_ elbows; sometimes a stinging sensation in one nostril.,I started taking Frova after generic imitrex stopped working (took off and on for 16 years) and began having frequent recurrences; Amerge never worked; Maxalt had too many side effects. If I take the Frova immediately at the first sign of migraine it keeps it from recurring. I took for my monthly menstrual migraine (which is the harshest and lasts usually 2 to 4 days) and I waited too long so I had a recurrence and had to take another one. My joints get very achy and my throat gets tight. These are much more tolerable than the migraine and the side effects I first experienced with imitrex/sumatriptan. Less side effects than the other triptans I've tried. Frova takes a little longer to work - about an hour but lasts longer and so far recurrence seems to be much lower and less painful.  I've only started taking it so I will see how well it works and report back.,F,38,2  months2.5 mg 1X AN,12/24/2010,Frova
18, 1, chronic_ severe migraines,nausea_ dizziness_ vomitting_ severe pain on rt. side of head_ pressure behind right eye with tearing_ pain radiates all down right side of head to the base of skull_ light & noise sensitivity_ overly-sensitive to smells,"Just returned from neuro visit-new doc.  Gave me Frova script even after going over the two page list of drugs I've been on in the last 25 years.  During a recent hospital stay (for migraine) neuro there told me_ ""See someone about Botox--it's just been approved.  It may help somebody with your history.""  New doc said_ ""No_ it hasn't been approved.  And even if you want the treatment_ there is too much paperwork & insurance rarely approves it.""

19, 5, Migraines,lightheaded - minor_ sometimes,I get hormonal headaches every month_ but if I take the Frova_ the headache is gone within 30 minutes and rarely (maybe only once) returns until the next month. This medicine has really helped me a lot. I went from not having a life for several days every month to being able to function within 30 minutes as if there was never a problem.,F,46,5  years2.5mg 1X M,4/7/2010,Frova
20, 5, Migraines,Mild tingling in arms_ lasting only a few minutes.  Slight fatigue.,Frova has been a wonder drug for me.  I have hormonal migraines that can be debilitating without treatment.  Upon taking Frova_ I usually have complete relief of the migraine in about 30 minutes.  The slight fatigue that I have after taking the med is well worth the relief of the migraine.,F,39,6  months2.5 mg 1X D,2/16/2010,Frova
21, 2, daily migraine,Tired_ unable to concentrate fully_ headhache only partially relieved.,It does not completely end the headache_ only lessens the severity.  It takes a long time to take effect (1+ hours). Foggy feeling coupled with the continuation of headache (although much less severe) makes this drug not worth taking.,F,49,6  days,1/14/2010,Frova
22, 5, migraines,a little neck_ scalp_ and facial tingling,This medicine is my life saver! After trying many different triptans_ this is the best for me.  Works quickly every time and NO REBOUND HEADACHE the next day!!!,F,27,4  years,12/19/2009,Frova
23, 4, migraines,tingling sensations,takes away the headache if i take it fairly quickly-1-2 hours of onset. lasts 1-2 days.  i have sometimes have  taken it with advil_ aleve_ etc. and have found that in combination its 99% effective.  would def recommend if you have frequent headaches that seem to build slowly over a couple days.,F,28,4  months,12/19/2009,Frova
24, 3, migraine with aura,"tingling_ jaw pain_ and feeling silly/loopy about 30 minutes-1 hour after taking FROVA. side effects lasted about 30-45 minutes.  also made me sleepy; fell asleep for 2 hours after the ""loopy"" feeling kicked in.","it seemed to ""push"" my migraine pain away - didn't relieve it entirely_ but did keep it in the background for about 3 hours.  unfortunately_ it then wore off and i needed to take opiate medication.  this has happened to me with *every* triptan i've taken.  they do not seem to work for me past about 3 hours.",F,49,6  months,11/13/2009,Frova

27, 4, Migraine,Break through headache_ fatigue.,"Frova has worked best for me as a way to prevent a migraine from returning after I have successfully aborted it with Imitrex or Relpax. Frova is a long acting Triptan that stays active in the system for 24-26 hours while Imitrex and Relpax are both fast acting Triptans that only stay active for 2 and 4 hours respectively. Used alone_ I don't find Frova as effective as the fast acting Triptans in fully aborting a migraine. The other downside to Frova is fatigue_ which I find builds up if I have to take it two or three days in a row. On the other hand_ that's still far better than the ""pre-Triptan days"" of blinding head pain_ vomiting for hours and feeling like I've been run over by a truck!",F,46,10  months,6/15/2009,Frova
