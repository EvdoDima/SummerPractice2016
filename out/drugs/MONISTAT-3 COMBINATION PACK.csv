0, 1, Yeast Infection,Burn from Hell. I haven taken Monistay before and has a small reaction (burning at night_ so I did not think anything when the same symptoms for a yeast infection appeared. I noticed a burning sensation and uncontrollable itch all night the 1st dose of the 3 day series. Into the next day my vulva and outside labia was swollen and itched so bad_ it started to burn during the day. I thought my yeast infection was so bad_ never in my wildest dreams did I think it was Monistat. I even attempted the 2nd dose and the burning was so intense. This gives a new meaning to Fire Crotch! Avoid this product. I suggest also making sure symptoms are indeed YI and not BV (bacterial vaginitis)_which has similar symptoms. Go to your doc and test for both before anyanibiotcs and take the YI pills not this crap. FdA should put a better warning.,,F,47,2  days,5/29/2016,Monistat-3 combination pack
1, 1, Yeast infection,Horrible vulvar swelling. Burning and itching unbearable sensitivity,I bought this to clear up a moderate yeast infection. After the first day of use I had vaginal sensitivity and increased itching and some swelling. I thought that the yeast infection was just worse than had originally thought. After 2nd dose I couldn't even wipe after urination without screaming. It itches so bad I want to rip my vagina off my body but it is so sensitive I can't touch it. Going to ice it_ take a benedryl and hope for the best,F,27,2  days,10/10/2015Email,Monistat-3 combination pack
2, 1, Yeast,Extreme burn and swelling.  CHEMICAL BURNS!,,F,25,1  days1 dose 1X D,1/22/2015,Monistat-3 combination pack
3, 1, Yeast Infection,Chemical burns which have not let up in days! AT ALL. To the lady that said_ it's a normal part of the healing process_ YOU HAVE NO IDEA what this feels like! I'd take 300 yeast infections over this! This is above and beyond normal!,Redness and blisters on vulva after using this. Burning got worse the 3 days I used it but I didn't put 2 and 2 together until later. This is VERY painful (and I almost dumped my bf because I accused him of giving me genital herpes.) :( The blisters are on the vulva where I'd used the external cream as well as where the internal cream tended to leak out. It has been days since I stopped using this cream. The yeast IS gone but the blisters remain! Peeing is excruciating! Try going around acting like everything is normal when it's excruciating to walk/sit and you can't tell everyone what's going on.,F,36,3  days 1X D,9/29/2014Email,Monistat-3 combination pack
4, 3, Yeast,I think that there is such a thing as an allergic reaction to this  medication_ or at least a strong sensitivity to the medication.  All women are different_ of course_ but this medication has caused chemical burns for me.,I have tried treating my infections with yogurt and pro-biotics.  If you use the yogurt as a topical treatment_ make sure it is plain white yogurt that is free from any flavor or added sugars/sugar substitute.  It actually feels pretty good_ and it has worked for me.  It takes a few more days to clear the infection_ and it is a bit more messy_ but it does not burn at all_ and is all natural.    I suggest applying yogurt many times a day_ as needed.  Of course_ if it does not clear up_ or gets worse_ see a doctor!,F,38,3  days200MG 1X D,5/20/2012,Monistat-3 combination pack
5, 2, Minor itching. I thought was yeast.,Extreme burning and itching.  Redness.  Severe swelling.,First_ I want to say that I had used Monistat products in the past_ multiple times_ with no problems other than the very minor increase in burn/itch when I first applied the cream.  This would then subside within a few minutes and all would be fine.  However_ this time I applied the cream and immediately had extreme burning and itching.  I thought maybe I had just forgotten how intense it could be and I felt I needed to leave the medicine on and endure it_ that it would pass.  I even resorted to using an ice pack to try to help the burning feeling.  After half an hour or so_ I could not take it any longer and rinsed it all off and soaked in cold water.  That's when I saw that my vagina was extremely swollen and red_ lumpy swelling.  It looked (and felt)horrible. The next day I went to my doctor and he said I had had an allergic reaction.  The swelling was down a bit by then_ but still not gone completely.  He prescribed an antihistamine tablet and a different type of cream to use on the area.**It is important to note that he tested me for yeast and I was negative.  It makes me wonder if that is why I had such a horrible reaction to the medicine_ because I did not have a yeast infection.  The doctor said he could not confirm or deny if that was the case_ but for me to not use this product in the future.,F,43,1  times 1X D,8/4/2010,Monistat-3 combination pack
6, 1, Yeast Infection,SIMPLY AWFUL! Woke me out of sleep! I have had 2 or 3 yeast infections before and have used Monistat. Something has changed - it is as though someone lit a fire inside of me. I was at a tolerable discomfort level pre-use and literally_ in tears_ with this pain. I did all three doses and it did NOT get better. Something is up with this product.,Buy pro-biotics at a health food store and eat a lot of yogurt. Next time I will try for the prescribed drug. This was a nightmare.,F,32,2  days,3/14/2008,Monistat-3 combination pack
7, 1, Yeast Infection,Burning_ itching_ swelling_ unbearable pain,I would not recommend Monistat 1 to my worst enemy. I thook the Monistat 1 when I noticed the irritation.  Big mistake.  Moments after I applied it_ it burned like hell!!! Horrible nights sleep_ and the cream did little to assist.  This continued the next day_ then the next day.  I was unable to walk or sit.  It was even harder to concentrate at work. I went to my GYN only to find out that it caused a chemical burn.  Now I am taking medication to rid the chemical burn.  Pure torture!! Avoid the Monistat 1 at all cost.,F,33,1  days,1/17/2008,Monistat-3 combination pack
8, 4, Vaginal Yeast Infection,Itcing and Redness_ low irritation but still very evident.,"I wasnt sure what was wrong with me so i decided to go with Vagisil to treat my symptoms_ when i went to buy it a lady at the drug store asked me about my symptoms and told me to get Monistat instead. I have been satisfied so far_ it works ok during the day i ahrdly notice i have an infection_ but when i apply the medication at night its irritating. The leaking makes it difficult to sleep bc of how distracting it is (im a light sleeper). but to the ppl who say ""DONT BUY IT"" shut up_ bc ur body is different then everyone elses and might have a different reaction to the product. who are u to tell woman to refuse a product that might help them a great deal? i recomend Monistat 3.",F,16,3  days,10/7/2007,Monistat-3 combination pack
9, 1, Yeast infection,"TERRIBLE BURNING_ ITCHING_ it felt like my insides were on fire! After some investigation_ it appears that this is a reaction that only ""a few"" women experience_ and so Monistat and the FDA have not considered it necessary to put a warning on the package that you might have this severe reaction to the product!","We can try to make a change: file a report with the FDA through MedWatch at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/  Do this so we can save other women from the pain we have suffered! Can you imagine if there was a male product marketed with the attitude_ ""For 95% of men_ this product will clear up your infection. Some men however will experience severe burns on their penis that may cause lasting pain upon any stimulation_ even if your boxers just brush up against your skin. But such a reaction is only experienced by a small group of men."" It would never fly! We can't let this happen to us!",F,26,1  days,3/29/2007,Monistat-3 combination pack
10, 5, Yeast Infection,I am reading all of these women's issues with the intense burning sensation right after they took it. People_ have some patience!!! It is burning because it is a medication_ on a very sensitive part of your body_ and it is healing an INFECTION. Damn it people dont knock it cause you cant take the healing process.If you have a yeast infection_ and you want it gone_ take monistat_ i recommend monistat 1_ because you only have to take it the once. But just be patient and realize you WILL have to endure some uncomfortable irritability_ but it will get RID of it in less than 24hrs_ and just think of the RELIEF!!!!!You can never get something for nothing_ you should know that.Gosh Darnit.:),,F,22,1  days,2/23/2007,Monistat-3 combination pack
11, 1, yeast infection,severe burning_ itching,I took the first night's dose of a drugstore version of Monistat-3 combo pack and immediately had severe burning & itching & feeling of need to urinate. I couldn't get relief so took something to help me sleep. This morning_ still serious burning_ itching & haven't taken the morning dose of external cream yet. Thanks_ ladies_ for posting b/c you've just kept me from making it worse. I'll call the doc on Monday & get something else. This is really nasty!,F,48,1  days,11/5/2006,Monistat-3 combination pack
