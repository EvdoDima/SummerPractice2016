6, 1, Hypertension,Dry Mouth_ palpitations_ cold feeling esp lower extremities_,Added to Diltiazem ER_ when BP was not staying down and reaction to Beta Blockers.  Hated combo from the start.  Check drug interaction charts before you take anything.  If they say may interact don't accept make Dr change it.  This is a curse from hell you cannot stop or change without dr supervision due to possible stroke or heart attack.  Should not be used today better choices.

7, 1, Erythromyalgia,Once your on clonodine over a year or more your Blood Pressure will get so high without it you will have a heart attack or stroke. Side effects go away after a year_ expect to lose teeth_ have dry mouth you never thought possible but worst please understand_  if you takecthis longvterm fir anything ...plan to have hypertension and High Blood Pressure when you have become accustomed and addicted tovit. Off course Dr.s say itvisnot addictive_ however RN and those who do not lie_ call it Blow Back. Meaning tryingvto stop it leads to physical withdrawal_  eventually ending in stroke or death. Try not to take more than a month_ horrible drug. Good only for short term_ perhaps has a place in treating short term addictions_  but do not take foecanything but hypertension unless you want hypertension_ no joke.,Long term use leads to not being ableto stop or taper off without a heart attack or stroke at best.,M,41,15  years6 mg a day 1X D,9/22/2014,Clonidine hcl

9, 5, Chest pains and Anxiety Attacks,"I started taking clonidine because of my anxiety attacks. A typical dose for me is 1-2 pills a day_ but only as needed. I usually take one every other day_ regularly. And then I add extra pills depending on my anxiety. The first 2 weeks I was exhausted and couldn't stay awake. I was taking 2 pills_ 2 times a day. I called my doctor and asked about that. They adjusted my dose and I started feeling more awake. This medicine is a lifesaver for me. I love it! It helps with my anxiety attacks quite well... with the added perk that it also helps with my angioedema (heat related). It makes me feel cool. As in temperature-wise_ not ""Oh I am awesome!"". I am not sure why_ but I love it because I can handle more temperature range so I can live a mostly normal life and go out more. It does make me tired but usually that is if I took it for a bad anxiety attack_ which is exhausting in itself.  I am much more alert when taking it now as my body has adjusted to it much better. The only nega",Clonidine isn't a medication you should stop cold turkey as your blood pressure can spike. If you need to stop taking it_ you need to cut back and let your body adjust to the smaller dose. When I took it for a week straight_ 1 pill a day_ I started doing 1 pill one day_ 1/2 pill the next day_ 1 pill the next day... and so on for about a week_ then I skipped the 1/2 pill so I was taking it every other day. I did this under doctor's supervision. If you stop it cold turkey_ you could have a stroke from your BP shooting up too high. Just warning you! I noticed a few people wrote that they had that issue when they stopped taking it. My doctor warned me about that when he prescribed it_ so I knew about it. I am warning every one else because it doesn't look like all other doctors give out that warning. If you aren't sure how you will react_ and you have a job or small children you need to be conscious for_ take 1 pill about 1-2 hours before bedtime. That way_ if you get exhausted_ you can sleep it off. I hope this helps every one.,F,38,8  months0.1 1X D,4/3/2014Email,Clonidine hcl

18, 3, HBP,dry mouth_ very dry skin_ hairloss_ weight gain_ lack of thirst even with the dry mouth_ sore gums (I believe must have to do with the dry mouth)_ constipation_ increased appetite,this use to work really well at lowering my BP as my backup medication when my every day meds weren't lowering it enough but as my primary medication it virtually doesn't touch i...hovers around 160/106. the dry mouth and dry skin is enough to drive you nuts_ and I find it strange that I have no thirst even with the dry mouth when typically I drink water like it's going out of style. my doctor insisted weight gain wasn't a side effect of clonidine but I just don't believe it and I know that ppl mostly say they have appetite loss...I have increase in appetite! crave sweets almost constantly. The one good thing I can say is how it manages my anxiety level (I'm hyperthyroid) so that is kinda nice but given it isn't improving my BP at all will be asking doc to change my meds again,F,30,2  months0.1 MG 2X D,11/7/2012Email,Clonidine hcl

CLONDINE has been a Blessing!Alas for me the Clonidine has not helped the  stomach problems that goes along with sympathetic nerve problems. Helped the facial flushing by 1⁄2.  I also had Immediate results within one day and after a few weeks even better.  Waking up Before taking Clonidine my blood pressure would be 189/90  and so out of breath I would about pass out in trying to walk to the bathroom.    Now upon waking blood pressure of 124/68. Did help somewhat with the shoulders not up to my ears in stress feeling.  Alas not by much. ,F,59,4  months0.01 2X D,8/17/2012Email,Clonidine hcl

Not fun to eat healthy and try to live a good lifestyle & your medicine is causing severe lethargy and then putting weight on no matter what- although it's secondary  purpose for me i'n controlling bp was achieved it's def not worth taking if your bp is only mild to moderately high- get something else bc it's had minimal to no effect on my ADHD and it actually made me feel like I needed more of my stimulant or some caffeine just to stay awake! Totally not worth it!!! I gained about 10 lbs then said- no more!!,,F,27,2  months.1mg 1X D,10/24/2011Email,Clonidine hcl

I notice a really bad headache (on left side of head) after taking this med. Light headed_ dry mouth. Dry eyes_ blurred vision.,Must admit it brings high pressure down quickly_ but then shoots right back up within a short period of time_ so I cut and split the dosages throughout the day_ don't know what to do to prevent spikes/bp drops from 188/135 to 90/52. The longer I have taken it_ it seems to take a higher dosage to bring my high bp down.  Of the 3 meds I take (Diovan_ Ziac and Clonidine) the Clonidine does the most good.,F,62,5  months.2 2X D,11/12/2010,Clonidine hcl

I tried Clonidine and after only three days I noticed that I was having bladder leakage again.  It took my bladder about three months to recover from my hysterectomy and when I started leaking again_ that was completely unacceptable.  The other problem was the extreme sleepiness.

31, 5, high blood pressure,Dry mouth,I have tried about 6-7 BP drugs. All either gave me a rash_ headache. or just didn't work. Clonidine HCL began working right away....and no side effects except a little dry mouth. And it's a generic drug. A dose of .1 mg three times a day brought my BP from 210/100 down to 150/75.

34, 5, Insomnia (natural/adderall-induced),Dizziness_ clouding vision_ beginning to black out if getting up too soon after taking it_ for longer than it otherwise would have kept me asleep. When waking more than 5 hours after taking it_ no side effects noticed. I have normal blood pressure_ and it does not lower my blood pressure overall.,I was prescribed this as a nightly sleeping pill (because that side effect of drowsiness is so high!) I had occasional trouble falling asleep that was exacerbated by my new adderall prescription. I take it every night_ and until I started taking antidepressants_ I couldn't fall asleep without it (or a substitute_ like alcohol or ambien.) Antihistamines_ valerian root_ and other over-the-counter remedies don't help at all_ except for NyQuil. Clonidine eventually was not strong enough to counteract the Adderall_ and I now take Ambien in addition to a half-dose of Clonidine when I take Adderall. I start feeling drowsy with a strong urge to sleep about 40 minutes after taking it_ which lasts for about 20 minutes. If I'm not asleep by the time this feeling wears off_ I need to take another dose. However_ if I wake up less than 5 hours after taking it_ I will be dizzy for several hours.,F,23,6  years,12/5/2007,Clonidine hcl
