0, 2, RA,Started having numbness and a little tingling in my extremities_ hands and feet as well as. Nasty bruises at the injection site. I believe the medication is not lasting as long as it used to 6 yrs is a long time. Notified Simponi regarding these issues but was not concerned. Think before going down this road. Thanks have a great day.....,Simponi needs to listen to its patients,M,55,6  years50mg,2/29/2016Email,Simponi

2, 2, Psoriatic arthritis,Headaches daily_ increased psoriasis_ redness of the face as well as psoriasis on my face_ inflammation around my eyes and irritation_ extreme fatigue_ increased joint and muscular pain . Have had a terrible cough for two months now.,Only works for two weeks and works great and immediately however it wears off and I get extreme flares for the rest of the month and extreme pain and immobility.  Have had to take prednisone for the last week as its unbearable.  Am on methotrexate 20mg a week don't think it's doing anything.,F,45,5  months50,12/22/2015Email,Simponi
3, 3, RA,My severe & constant RA pain and stiffness almost completely disappeared!  I was 90% back to normal.  I recommend simponi to everyone as it was once a month and self  injector barely hurt.  Then it happened at 1 year.....terrible psoriasis...4 types all over my body. Psoriasis on hands and feet cracked_ bled and limited me more than RA.  All went away within 3 months off simponi except terrible hand/foot type that required a year of PUVA light therapy to clear.,,F,47,1  years1X mth,1/30/2015,Simponi
4, 4, PsA,Sinus headaches that may be related_ but not certain.,This has made a significant improvement in my life. I feel like a normal human being again and can do many of the activities I previously enjoyed. I do notice that by the third week I begin to feel stiffness and pain in various joints.,F,41,1.8  years50MG 1X M,12/1/2014Email,Simponi
5, 4, rheumatoid arthritis,No side effects,Only problem I've had with it is that it tends to wear off. A dosage of once every three weeks would be ideal. It's helped me a lot!!! I was scared to try it but found it to work well and to have no side effects- have only had a cold or two in a year. Don't hesitate to try it.,F,58,1  years50 mg 1X M,2/28/2013,Simponi
6, 4, Rheumatoid Arthritis,none,This is my 3rd biological DMARD I've tried and it's worked great for me.  I had bad injection site reactions to Enbrel and Humira_ so I was pretty excited that this one was a keeper.  It has also worked to keep my RA at bay as well.,F,30,8  months1 inject. 1X M,4/25/2011Email,Simponi
7, 3, Psoriasis arthritis,Headache_ flu symptoms_ itching_ nausea_ shortness of breath_ depressed_ stomach pain_ inflammation.,Not the best medicine for my arthritis_ but helps a little on the swollen joints_ and the pain. does not help the psoriasis on the skin.,M,36,6  months50 mg 1X M,1/9/2011Email,Simponi
8, 3, Lupus,Couldn't even feel the injection.  Couldn't really tell if the medication helped either because I've been on steriods nearly the whole year.  I do still have flares but they seem a lot more manageable.,,F,35,1  yearsprefilled 1X D,1/1/2011,Simponi

12, 2, rheumatoid arthritis,I just administered my 2nd injection. This is a once a month TNF drug. Definitely pain at injection site but only for a couple of minutes.  I use the prefilled syringes once monthly. Have not noticed any other side effects however I have not noticed any improvement either.  As a matter of fact my hands are actually getting worse.  I am not currently on Methatrexate. I go back to rheumy on Mon. July 13 so we shall see what she says.  I know they say sometimes it takes a month or 2 to start to see any benefit so... hopefully next month I will be able to increase my rating on this drug.,,F,46,2  months,7/11/2009Email,Simponi
