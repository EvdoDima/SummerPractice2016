1, 5, Carcinoid & Carcinoid Syndrome,gallbladder had to be removed due to 200 gallstones w/in 60 days of starting drug_ thyroid problems requiring treatment_ pain in limbs and internal spasms of blood vessel,"This drug has kept me alive and functioning_ but it has not been a ""free pass"" for me.  I had to have my gallbladder removed within 60 days of starting and have had a lot of pain in my arms and legs.  Severe.  It feels like a crushing pain. Thankfully_ it has not been constant_ but has required treatment at times.  Don't understand what it is. Also_ severe thyroid problems and gained lots of weight.THE GOOD PART:  my blood sugar is under control_ the diarrhea and vomiting from the hormones the tumor secretes and the breathing problems are much better.The flushing totally stopped for many years.  The medication has protected me prior to surgery and rescued me when things were not going well in the ER.   These problems were keeping me confined to home and making my life a living torture.  Also_ I have not had the terrible spread of tumor that some with this diagnosis have had.  I have been blessed that my docs were aggressive with starting this right away and kept the dose up",F,46,14  days,10/1/2007,Sandostatin
