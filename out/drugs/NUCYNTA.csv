7, 1, Herniated Discs/fibromyalgia,Hallucinations when closing my eyes_ I've felt like I've looked down a 4 barrel shotgun plus I've seen grey flashing lights. This was while awake_ I am afraid to sleep. When finally fell asleep I had horrific dreams. Major headaches that won't go away. I am also extremely nauseous. I have been tired and afraid of getting out of my bed because my body feels like I'm drugged I have a hard time walking. I feel like I am completely stoned. I've also been dizzy and had an out of body experience when backing my car out of the driveway. My Dr told me to halve the medicine_ I did that and refused to take it until my husband was ready for bed. I woke up in extreme pain.,I asked my Dr for this medicine since my friend takes it and has not had any issues. I also take oxy but fell like it's not helping me as much anymore. I will be calling my Dr Monday morning and tell him the side effects scare me and I will no longer be taking this medicine.

15, 1, Back pain_ joint pain and RLS,Dizziness_ sweats_ racing irregular heartbeat_ strange semi conscious state_ and hallucinations.,Did nothing for pain! I had a bizarre reaction two hours after I took it and shortly after I took my bedtime meds. After the fact my Dr and I believe that I experienced Sarotonin Syndrome. When I used a online interaction checker it boldly and in red stated that this was a major interaction_ and that the two drugs should never be used together. Evidently_ my doc didn't get the memo. Oh_ and mine was the Nucynta ER. Did I mention that it didn't work for shit?,F,53,2  days100,1/15/2016Email,Nucynta

Percocet quit working_ my Dr put me on Nucynta and I immediately felt a difference. I'm not groggy_ there are no side affects like opioid meds I'd been on in the past. I am_ however_ experiencing shaking and heart palpitations. I_ too_ take zoloft and will need to adjust per my Dr. Worth the change!

19, 5, chronic pain_ trigeminal neuralgia,Confusion_ sweating_ ataxia,After four months of use I found out that my side effects were due to serotonin syndrome.  The Mayo Clinic and Medline have good articles.  You need to understand that serotonin syndrome can cause seizures_ coma and death.I halved my Zoloft dosage with almost immediate results.  It has been a very good pain relieving drug for me.  I've been on painkillers since 1997 namely Oxycontin and later_ Norco.  I hated Oxy - the side effects were nausea and vomiting and Norco wasn't doing anything to relieve pain.Use caution and PLEASE read about serotonin syndrome if you take this drug in combination with any SSRI_ i.e. Zoloft_ Prozak.  If I'd been educated it would have saved me a trip to the emergency room.,F,59,1  years100 mg 3X D,10/12/2015Email,Nucynta

21, 5, Atypical Facial Neuralgia,Initial Problems with constipation (about first 3 months),I take this as needed for face and scalp neuralgia and average 2.5 per day over a month. My pain is most often just like atypical Trigeminal Neuralgia but sometimes also includes portions of my scalp pain.  Nucynta Immediate Release starts working within 20 minutes and lasts about 6 hours for me. My mild and moderate pain spikes last less than 8 hours often. My severe pain spikes_ I sometimes overlap pills or take two but I stay within my monthly pill allotment. Before trying Nucynta_ I was on Percocet that had to be increased three times in 14 months. I had less pain relief with the percocet than I do with the Nucynta. It can completely control my mild and moderate pain_ and it does significantly reduce pain during my severe pain spikes. I found the extended release (ER) version of this medication to be completely useless but I often have trouble with ER versions of medications. The constipation issues were easily overcome with dietary changes or fiber supplements. My body adjusted to it just fine.,F,52,2  years50MG 2X D,9/5/2015,Nucynta
22, 1, Chronic pain,Do not take this medication! You have incredibly hard heart palpitations also while sleeping you will quit breathing waking up like you're drowning.

23, 1, Pain from surgery,Please do not use this drug_ dr gave me this to add to my oxycodone. I took it and within the hour it effected my breathing_ heart palpitations_ cloudy and foggy head_ black spots_ and still having trouble seeing after 5 day and only took one pill 5 days ago_ heart still racing and heart palpitations _ going to er today because I've never in my life been so scared. Vision is wavy and foggy_ and images are like a fu. House mirror.   Been waiting it out to see if it flies away but has not. This is a synthetic drug.  Avoid   Please do not take this drug. You do not want to experience what I am going through. I'll take the pain any day over this.,Stay away from this.  Report it to the drug administration.,M,45,1  days50,8/10/2015Email,Nucynta
24, 3, Herniated disc in lower back,I started this drug after being on Tramadol for years and it was no longer working.,The first few days was fine. I have not had a steroid ejection in almost 6 months so it did not take away all of the pain but it did help a lot. This was expected though. After the thrid day_ i could not sleep at all. I started taking less doses throughout the day but nothing was helping. I am in the process of stopping it_ i have way too much going on to not sleep. I am going to see my dr in a few weeks so until then I am going to go back on the Tramadol. It is not great at all but it will have to work.,F,28,4  days50mg 4X D,8/9/2015,Nucynta
25, 1, 12yrs of back/leg/hip pain,From 1st dose felt almost like an out of body experience.. Sweating_ heart pounding_ hard to breath_ no appetite_ couldn't focus_ couldn't sleep_ burning in legs_ physically shaky and unstable_ headaches----all this got worse and I was only taking 2-3 a day instead of the 4 a day..,"Been in pain management for over 6yrs with live able results.. Referred to a ""new_ more specialized"" doctor.... On 2nd visit he took me off my regular 10mg Norco 4-5 daily and put me on Nucynta along with Lopressor_ Kolnipin_ Bacefoln... By the 5th day of Necunta I thought/wanted to die!!! 4 days I had only slept lightly for about 3yrs_ lost 14lbs from Monday afternoon till Friday morning.. I had become so verbally unstable and aggressive I had been sent home from work twice.. Note_ my work involves me handling/administering controlled substances to animals and working in various dangerous situations_ the doctor knew this prior to changing my meds!! He is putting me back on my Norco but was sure to express his ""professional"" expert knowledge assuring me that NONE of my symptoms were known side effects to/from Nucynta!!!! Guess he hasn't been educated on this drug_ they are ALL side effects to it plus some!!!! My advice_ stay with what works_ don't be a lab rat_ I am still sick_ hurting and sleepless even though I have been off Nucynta for 2-3 days now!!! NEWER drugs aren't always better and more effective_ sometimes_ most times they make things worse_ Nucynta will if you take it but good luck if you decide to try it anyway... I am also NOT allergic to any other medications nor have I ever reacted to any other ""pain"" medication----FDA NEEDS TO PULL THIS DRUG!!!!",F,35,5  days75@4 daily,7/19/2015,Nucynta

30, 5, Surgery pain and Fibromyalgia,No side effects,My wife cannot take nsaids and gets very sick and dizzy on narcotics. We decided to try Nucynta because it is supposed to cause less nausea. The doctor prescribed 50mg which I believe is a low dosage. Because my wife gets sick on narcotics we decided to cut the 50 mg into four pieces and therefore try a very tiny dose. To our surprise it worked. It gave good pain relief and absolutely no nausea! We plan to slowly up the dosage_ but we were so happy with the results so-far we decided to post here to perhaps help others.,F,70,1  weeks12.5 mg 1X AN,4/8/2015,Nucynta
31, 5, Degenerative disk and chronic gout,Thirsty_ but easily dealt with by drinking water. A bit euphoric. I thought it wasn't working well at all until my dose was accidently bumped down to 50mg. It was originally at 75mg. So I had to take two at a time. 100mg doses were perfect! Gout is a horrible thing and super painful_ it took the edge off. Much better than more addicting medication. I just take one a night_ do not feel the need for more.. I wake up pain free (from ny back pain). Love this stuff! It's been two years_ not really seeing negative side effects.,,F,34,2  years100 mg,3/20/2015Email,Nucynta

33, 5, Severe focal neuropathy,Almost none but totally worth it. My short term memory is pretty much destroyed. Night sweats and an inability to control my own body temperature. I am certain this has to do with my low estrogen levels. My doctor and I worked it out by increasing another medication before bed_,This was my miracle drug. Within an hour of the first dose_ I could get up. I am still only partially up a few hours a day and have a lot of other medications as well but this was the one that saved me. Prior to this ketamine and morohine and dilaudid did not ease the pain enough for me to sit up even. Now I can have limited functionality for a few hours a day where things almost seem normal.,F,43,6  months200 3X D,2/3/2015Email,Nucynta

35, 1, CFS; myalgia,Benzodiazepine-esque amnesia_ activation_ panic_ confusion_ numbness,The absolute strangest opioid on the market. Feels like an overdose of an SNRI with some pain relief. Caused panic_ fight or flight_ mild but noticeable hallucinations. The worst side effect is the dysphoria that mimics supertherapuetic dose of DXM_ ketamine; definitely an NRI activating effect and highly undesirable. Can cause death by serotonin syndrome when taken in conjunction with SSRIs/MAOIs_ tryptans and tricyclical ADs_ possibly other drugs (dissociatives). No value as a pain reliever.,M,30,5  days200,1/26/2015Email,Nucynta
36, 4, 9 orthopedic surgeries due 2 wrecks,****** This is the most important side effect of the 200 mg extended release******  The time release failed on me 4 times and dumped all the meds into me at once.  The first three I thought were due to my bruised heart from the wreck.  Family took me to the ER.  Charcoal (tasted like a chocolate shake) didn't work because the dump of opioids was already in my blood.  I slept for 7 hours then my mom woke me up.  I was falling asleep eating_ so off to the ER. Staff assumed it was an intentional OD_ treated me accordingly (like crap).  When it hit I was out with the kids. Bought my daughter a cell phone.  In the ER triage they asked why I was there.  My sister didn't know how to term my issue_ but I could.  I'm a firefighter.  I told them altered LOC (Level of Consciousness)_ but I couldn't remember the year.  It was almost like an out of body experience.  They asked who the President was.  I sighed and said Obama_ which they laughed at.  I presume the Narcan didn't work_ so I was sent,Otherwise the Nucynta was like the morphine ER_ but didn't cause the severe constipation like Morphine.I'm noticing some short term memory is off.  It is difficult to recall how to spell simple words.,M,42,2  months100 10X D,11/13/2014Email,Nucynta

Weird dreams_dizziness_ etc. But all side effects went away in a couple days.,Without my nucynta 100mg ER and my 50 mg IR. I am unable to move. I didn't have any for a couple days and my family could tell how much pain I was experiencing without them. I didn't go through any withdrawal symptoms. And with the immediate release my pain subsided within minutes of taking one. I am glad my doctor prescribed them. I am not 100% pain free but I can function daily now,F,36,7  months50 mg/100m,11/11/2014Email,Nucynta
38, 1, Severe back disorder,Could not sleep at all. Had the sweats. Ended up in the hospital with a heart attack (actually 2). I think this drug needs to be further tested before given out. I ate before each dosage so I didn't have upset stomach_ but a pain medication should not react opposite and keep you up all night long and on the go and doing things that you shouldn't be doing because of the disorder you already have and cause further problems. Within a few days I ended up going to ER with chest pains which turned out to a week long stay because of having a heart attack_ which I was feeling and doing fine_ just had a great physical_ blood test.

44, 3, Chronic Pain,Insomnia from the very beginning.Very frequent hot flashes_ beginning a week into the trial.Ocular migraines (scintillating scotomata)_ a couple of times a day_ beginning at 1-1/2 weeks.,The Side Effects I mentioned are simply not bearable.NOTE: Nucynta is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. This means that it increases serum norepinephrine_ which is (with other hormones) responsible for hypothalamic temperature regulation. I'm seeing that female Nucynta users in peri- or post-menopause (i.e._ who do not have sufficient estrogen to play a preventative role) may suffer from the KNOWN ill-effects of elevated norepinephrine on temperature regulation: Disappearance of the neutral zone between Sweats and Chills.This side effect (and sex/age correlation) is not specifically suggested in the manufacturer literature_ as I believe it should be: A special advisory for women approaching/in/past menopause.Nucynta Positives: 1. Analgesia - More effective than the oxycodone-IR I'd been on for a year. Nucynta is my first round-the-clock drug_ however (I'll have to keep looking).2.

I was sent to a sports medicine dr who thought I possibly had a fractured rib that had been missed. Anxiety comes along w pcs and before wreck either anxiety or upper back pain were present. Pain was eating me alive it seemed worse it could get. People DO NOT TAKE TRAZIDONE AND NUCYNTA TOGETHER. I took the two not at the same time as directed I was sick almost unconscious sick for a week during a blizzard. I woke up after taking nucynta at noon and trazidone before bed as directed and woke in the night blind w a migraine and pain u cant describe down both of my legs. One dose ....I live w a pain I cant describe everyday and it never leaves. Dr truly meant to help but please contact me if u have had this happen. Hospital I saw dr at ate the bill but pharmacy asked my dad is he having horrible pain down both legs. WOW IT HAD HAPPENED BEFORE YET THEY STILL GAVE THE TWO OUT. research has shown me taken together they are toxic and I want anyone else to contact me if this has happened. I made 50 dollars an hour now I can barely walk I made my gf of 2 years leave because it ruined me one dose people. FDA confirmed they are toxic I am not wanting money I cant walk to spend it.

50, 2, Chronic low back/neck pain,Switched from Norco 10/325 and experienced 3-4 days of withdrawals. Felt great for next 4 days_ pain went from 8 to 0_ literally pain free. Then all the side-effects started in.  Very restless_ anxious_ couldn't focus. At times I would just sit and stare into space for hours. I called myself the restless zombie. I didn't trust myself to drive on this stuff. Also experienced insomnia with wicked restless legs. The last straw was the increased heart rate. Doctor switched me back to Norco,After switching back to Norco_ I don't get the same pain relief as I did with Nucynta_ but at least I feel human again.,F,51,11  days100 2X D,3/6/2014,Nucynta

52, 3, Back Pain_ Leg Pain_ Ankle Pain,about an hour after taking it_ I get hit with a huge wave of nausea_ flushing_ anxiety_ rapid-heart beat_ and I feel REALLY bad.  My face and upper body area get red and feel hot.  Then after an hour that goes away_ and I get chills.  The nausea is so bad I sometimes vomit.,The strange wave of bad side effects that come on after an hour are really disconcerting_ and disabling.  If I am out in a car somewhere or something I have to pull over to deal with it.  It helps the pain well_ reduces pain from an 8 to a 2 or 3 for me_ but the very hard whammy of rough side effects makes it too much.  I am going to ask to go back to traditional opiods like Percocet.,F,50,3  months50MG 3X D,12/15/2013,Nucynta

59, 3, Chronic & Acute Pain: Ehlers Danlos,Ha! Who knows.. Everything? I take Nucynta 100 ER and 75 IR (2x) in addition to Voltaren 75 (2x)_ Vyvanse 70_ Propranolol_ Valium_ Bentyl_ Nexium_ Zofran_ there's an entire list..,Basically_ Nucynta initially provided a wonderful respite from my widespread chronic pain_ and still does in large doses_ but it's not worth the side effects/withdrawals.. I have a connective tissue disorder that causes organ issues_ joint pain and  dislocations_ along with other comorbid conditions like MVP/Dysautonomia_ heart arrhythmia_ Spinal Arthritis_ Costrocondritis_ etc._ which can all be very difficult to manage_ especially at my age. However_ after several months of relief_ I feel the Nucynta has caused a MAJOR recurrence in partial seizures and has also (in conjunction with the NSAIDS) caused painful Gastroparesis. For the past month_ at least_ I've also become quite temperamental and depressed_ at times w/ suicidal ideation- NOT normal for me and an obvious chemical imbalance in the brain. I also wake up in near excruciating pain EVERY SINGLE MORNING until I've had about 3 hours for the meds to kick all the way back in. The sharp increase in baseline pain/immediate withdrawal is unbelievable and includes full body aches/'bone' feeling pains_ severe weakness and sweating_ extreme nausea_ pallor_ etc. I'm hoping to wean back off of this ASAP but on such a high dose I cannot do this on my own. Even under a pain management doctor's discretion_ this drug should be used EXCEEDINGLY carefully in conjunction with other heavy medications and multiple coexisting conditions_ and_ in my opinion_ simply should not be given to anyone with a history of seizures.,F,27,4  months100ER/75IR 2X D,6/4/2013,Nucynta

Within an hour I felt violently sick with nausea (kinda like drinking way too much). I tried to eat some crackers_ but it didn't help. Although it didn't make it any worse. About 45 min later I passed out. I woke up about 6 hours later wondering feeling lost and confused. I decided that this was not the drug for me. I was out of it a bit_ but had to go to work. BTW I did not get any relief from the pain in my hand. I went home and was back in bed by 8pm. I took an 800mg Motrin and I slept off and on and had a headache and felt stuffy and restless. I woke up off and on from about 2am to 6am from pain in hand_ headache_ constipation and stuffiness. I slept from about 6am to 9am 5/10/13 and got up to get ready for work. I felt a bit groggy_ but thought it was due to lack of sleep. I had a few errands on my way to work and noticed that I was shak,I told my Dr that tramodol causes me to itch.

Little over half way As I was driving I must have been in a trance as I did not remember anything for last 10 miles when I was stopped by Deputies and charged with DUI.  (I do not drink what-so-ever).  Found ater toxicology report finished 9 months later by the state that I was twice over legal limit to be in a vehicle_ especially driving.

66, 1, lower back pain; degenerative disk,Dr. prescribed one Nucynta 75 mg every 4-6 hours.  Immediatley started having upset stomach.  First three days_ could not wake up or get out of bed for hours.  At work_ felt zoned-out_ dizzy_ tired. Had persistent headaches; felt bloated_ nauseous. Pain continued to be dull_ persistent.  Felt depressed;began having respiratory problems. A major side effect is respiratory illness/disease.  Had trouble sleeping b/c of persistent pain; trouble concentrating. Cramps_ night sweats ensued. Had the squirts_ but  never had a good bowel movement. Could not take my amitriptyline_ so was difficult to sleep; watched movies until dawn the first few days. No hallucinations_ euphoria. Had short term memory loss; could not remember things: why I was returning some customers phone calls or remembering who I was speaking to. (Very bad for business!)  Was confused and frustrated_ and had consistent_ dull pain. Had tremors when typing/writing. Since complaining_ prescription nurse thinks I am crazy and do,"My RPh. advised me that Nucynta works differently than other pain narcotics.  Did not quite understand but I got the impression that it tricks your brain into blocking/receiving pain from your nerves. I tried to research ""How Does Nucynta Work?"" on-line. I discovered that experts do not know why/how it actually works. I told about the new medication  and that I was feeling weird.  She told me about the ""Ask a Patient"" website_ and I was appalled at what I discovered.  Apparently_ my pain specialist does not know about the side effects either because when I called to advise him of what was going on_ his prescription nurse called me back and told me that my doctor thought I had a stomach virus and that I needed to make an appointment with my primary care physician.  Now_ my pain specialist has done wonders for me in the past so I am not trying to knock him_ but I really think that the pharmaceutical companies get their representatives out there and sell doctors all over the country that this med or that is the ""best thing since sliced bread.""  My pharmacist has been my family pharmacist since I was a teenager.  And he keeps up with the times.  He has an app on his smart phone that can notify him of any possible interactions with other meds I am taking.  In this case_ I was advised that I could not take amitriptyline (an anti-depressant also used in low doses to treat sleep disorders) which this same physician had prescribed to help me get to sleep",M,53,8  days75 6X D,2/10/2013,Nucynta

I take it about an hour before bed and before I know it I'm nodding off.  I'm sure it's also because of the Xanax and Lyrica.  I've been sleeping great and feeling no pain at night.  Nucynta is nothing like Oxy_ Lortab/Vicodin or Morphine.  It's not heavenly as I like to call them.  It's more like Ultram but instead of keeping me wired it actually puts me down.

Not for me!,F,40,30  days50-75 1X D,9/5/2010,Nucynta

107, 3, back injury,Irritable for no reason_ bad memory_ not happy as usual.,Update from previous entry. It worked for pain_ but side effects not worth the relief. Other meds have less undesirable side effects. Took myself off nucynta (3 week ordeal). Memory and thinking improved.,M,58,6  months100mg 3X D,7/12/2010,Nucynta
108, 3, Chronic pain_ Insomnia,Sleepiness_ full body twitching_ shaky hands when it first hits you_ mild euphoria_ mild itching_ urinary difficulty_ severe short term memory loss that leads to inability to maintain conversations_ Catatonia-like freezing in place (like a statue) especially when first prescribed.,"Taken at higher doses (ex. 400 mgs in one dose) this med feels a lot like Demerol. Starts with a slight euphoria that feels very calming and chill_ but as it increases in the bloodstream there is MAJOR confusion and memory loss in mid-sentence. ""Out of it"" feeling. Forget to swallow food in my mouth. It's like someone hit the pause button on the remote. On the upshot_ pain control is great and sleep is not as disturbed as oxycodone or hydrocodone.",F,29,7  weeks100 mg 2X D,6/20/2010,Nucynta
109, 2, Pain Management,fuzzy 'out of touch' feeling; slight dizziness and feeling of sadness. Some abdominal discomfort.,Drug was touted as pain mgmt/anti-depressant. Didn't do much for my pain and I developed a feeling of hopelessness and cried alot.,F,55,14  days50 mg 3X D,6/17/2010Email,Nucynta
110, 5, neck and back injury_ bursitis,"Dizzy/floaty ""high"" feeling first day (very much like the nitrous at the dentist). Some sweating/feeling warm.","First day_ dizzy and felt a bit spacey_ but not in a bad way. It was kind of like_ ""Weeeeee!"" if that makes sense. That part has gradually lessened each day; today just felt slightly euphoric but no dizziness. Doesn't keep me awake at night like oxycodone does (WOOT!)_ no itching_ no nausea when taken with food_ no headaches. Hips/bursitis feeling great_ almost zero pain when sitting for extended periods. Overall_ very happy with this med so far!.",F,40,5  days100 2X D,5/7/2010,Nucynta
111, 4, Back pain_ degenerative.,After using percocet for 8 years_ not effective enough. Nucynta helps with pain as well as percocet. Taking both now. Problems are: constipation_ slight upset stomach unless taken with food. A little irritation at times. Mood- can't put finger on it but know something is different_ not as normally happy. Insomnia.,Nucynta 100 mg has same effect on pain as Percocet 10/325 mg.,M,58,2  months100 mg 2X D,2/6/2010,Nucynta
112, 1, foot surgery,depressed_ agitated_ very emotional_ crying a lot_ couldn't eat (not good for healing)_just felt sickly and gross(never experienced this feeling before)_ night sweats_ heart racing_ extra sleepy or wired (couldn't win)_ panic attack_ constipation_ etc.,Had switched to Nucynta after a week on Oxycontin and Vicodon.  I had to stop using this stuff.  I am normally a very positive happy person.  It didn't help my pain enough for the hopelessness it caused.  Quit cold turkey after two weeks on pain meds.  Had two sessions of colon hydrotherapy sessions to help get toxins out and constipation flowing.  Dealt with withdrawals (3 days) and pain from surgery_ but was worth feeling like myself mentally.,F,36,5  days,12/24/2009,Nucynta
