0, 2, for mild acne,they worked really well on my skin but gave me quite severe mood swings and feelings of anxiety and depression and occasional suicidal thoughts which really frightened me_ im certain that these drugs played a role in how i was feeling although there may have been other causes this was the main cause because before i was taking them and after i stopped taking them i was feeling okay again i've taken other antibiotics to help my skin and every time i have been on them i have came to the same conclusion that they affect my mood to a serious degree which i cant handle and so i come off of them.,I think that this medication can be very dangerous and especially if its taken over a long period of time (for me around 1-2 months or more could have a serious affect on me) and people should be informed at how this medication can cause serious mood swings/depression/anxiety. This i feel should be put on the side effects list as there are others who have had a similar problem as i have had. I think that there should be some action taken on this if possible as i wouldn't one anyone to have the same experience i have had. Generally with this drug i think you should be very cautious and sensible and i think try to take the least dosage you possibly can as this will hopefully reduce these side effects or so i have been told.,F,15,1  months500 mg 2X D,3/15/2014Email,E.e.s.
1, 5, Persistant sore throat,None whatsoever.,Cured the sore throat which later culture info pointed to a staph infection with resistance to penicillins so this was a good choice for antibiotic.  I might add this was a second try on this problem because the first was ENT and gave me nothing.  The second GP believed me and did something and later on my own I found out the culture results that the first had never followed up on.,M,58,10  days,6/4/2005,E.e.s.
