1, 1, Indigestion,After taking this pill i have had nausea_ stomach cramps_ burping and hasn't helped at all. I stopped taking it. Strangely_ i bought Zantac from Walmart and took it twice daily for 3 days and i feel a lot better. I recently have discovered Zantac is ranitidine. I don't understand why Ranitidine makes me feel sick and Zantac doesn't. Only thing i can think of is Zantac is 75mg and Ranitidine is 150mg.,,F,22,3  days150 2X D,1/1/2012Email,Ranitidine hcl
