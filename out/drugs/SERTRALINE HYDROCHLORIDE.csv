5, 4, Severe Anxiety,A little drowsy,This medicine saved my life.  Im a 28 year old male who had no serious problems in his life.  Good family_ beautiful girlfriend_ great job but would have these episodes of severe anxiety.  Last year I felt hopeless.  Felt like a waste.  No one understood what I was feeling other than people who actually experienced it themselves.  I was too stubborn to take medication at first.  Thought it made me feel like less of a man and weak.  I came to terms that this was the chemistry of how my brain was functioning.  Finally after three years of on and off symptoms of anxiety I decided to take sertraline which was recommended by someone who was currently taking it.  This person is a family member of mine so I figured if my anxiety was genetic that maybe the medication would work.  After four weeks of taking it_ it started to kick in.  I was very skeptical after the first two weeks when i didn't feel any positive results but was told by the Doctor to give it a chance.  The day before I started feeling the positive results of the medicine I was ready to sign into a psychiatric center.  Now I have my personality and social life back.  And don't stress over petty issues in life anymore. I was fortunate that there was no trial and error of other meds for me.  If it works for you you will love it.,M,28,1  years100mg 1X D,10/29/2011Email,Sertraline hydrochloride
