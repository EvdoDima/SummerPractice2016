0, 3, migraines,Initially very satisfied. Was an absolute god send to me. Nothing had ever made any impact in my migraines and then my doctor told me to try mazalt. Worked so well. With in half an hour to an hour the migraine and all its affects are completely gone. However i get migraines as regularly 2 times a week so my doctor started putting me on preventive meds. Sadomigrain then amitriptyline. Worst mistake ever. The amitriptyline with the maxalt produced some scary side affects. I had 2 episodes of SVT_ frequent PVC'S and was just generally feeling really unwell. I did not know what was happening. All the sudden i was sick all the time. My doctor checked for heart disease_ and they are now checking for nuralogical. I was scared it might of been cancer because my sister died of cancer. And then i noticed weird symptoms like my blood pressure went into stage 1 hypotension_ increased pvc's and i had muscle spasms in my leg after taking maxalt. So I looked up the side affects of maxalt and just so happened to read first where it said it is recommended that maxalt and amitriptyline are not given together as they increase the effects of one or both medications. So now i need to find out if the side effects at permanent_ and what i can do about them. The echo of my heart showed enlargement and stage 1 calcification of the aorta valve. So just be very careful what medications you are taking together even if your doctor prescribes tbem.,,F,31,3  years,2/25/2016Email,Maxalt-mlt

2, 5, Severe migraines,None,I use this as needed for migraines.  It is a lifesaver.  The sooner you take it_ the sooner your migraine will go away.  I feel groggy for a couple of days afterwards but not any worse than I wold have had I gone through the whole migraine experience.  This stuff is simply amazing.  I will say:  do NOT use it if it expires.  It really loses efficacy.  I found this out by accident.,F,42,1  days15 mg 1X D,10/19/2015,Maxalt-mlt
3, 4, Frequent severe migraines,Deel very heavy_ nauseous and tired - to the point where i feel nauseous just thinking about taking a pill. Very heavy head_ nasty feeling like brain is being pulled downwards. Tremor_ cant keep head upright_ urgent need to sleep (usually for a few hours and feeling of being over sedated_ sometimes making it difficult to sleep initially)_ slurred speach_ general effects of drowsiness.,I do get a very uncomfortable reaction from this medication_ which makes me reluctant to take this medication when i have a migraine. However_ it does work nearly every time i do take it so it is often worth the unpleasent sies effects and sleeping for a few hours and not taking on an empty stomach helps a little with these.,F,35,4  years10mg 1X D,10/13/2014,Maxalt-mlt

5, 5, migraine,I've taken maxalt for at least 5 years perhaps more. I like the melts much better than the pill since I also get nauseous.  The pill takes much longer to work for me. Usually it relieves my headache 100%. Sometimes it takes a couple hours.,,F,44,5  years10,5/4/2013,Maxalt-mlt

I have hyponeutremia (chronically low sodium) so have to eat lots of salt. When one vomits they get rid of mostly sodium so I had to stop imitrex. Maxalt is the greatest if for some reason didn't work have to take vicodin.

12, 5, Migraines,Occasional tiredness but goes away after a short period of time.  Allows me to take it whenever I need it because of so few_ if any_ side effects.,This drug saved my life...or should I say gave me a life back.  My insurance doesn't cover it...but it's so important to me that I've found ways to pay for it.  It's THAT important. I tried other things that only made me sick.  Only drawback..doesn't work if I take it before I go to sleep_ for some reason. .,F,60,11  years10 1X AN,9/27/2012,Maxalt-mlt

14, 5, Migraine,Slight drowsiness,I have had migraines for years and was always afraid to take medications for them.  I finally started Maxalt on the advice of my doctor and I am so glad that I got over the fear.  I used to spend hours in bed suffering with extreme headache pain_ nausea_ light/sound/smell sensitivity and vomiting.  Now_ if I catch it in time_ it will get better usually within an hour.  I even feel comfortable taking it at work.  If I wake up with a migraine that is well underway_ I will take Maxalt and lay down for a few hours.  It definitely helps me control my migraine and gives me back the precious time that I used to lose having to sleep one off!  It has been a life changer for me and I always have them with me!,F,54,1  years10 mg 1X AN,2/24/2012Email,Maxalt-mlt

I layed down and I could barely breathe. I seriously thought that I was going to die that night laying in my bed_ probably should have went to the ER. NEVER TAKING THIS MEDICINE EVER AGAIN. And the best part was I still had my migraine the whole time this was  happening_ didnt even make it any better. Wish I would have read the side affects and reviews before I had taken this drug.

18, 1, Migraines,Dry Mouth,This drug has not worked for me at all.  I have tried over a week for my cluster migraines and have had little or no relief whatsoever.  I was originally using Imigran (Sumatriptan) which was quite effective_ however took up to an hour to work.  The doctor recommended Maxalt to me and I have been miserable ever since.  I have just taken another Maxalt which has done nothing at all.  I am going to get some more Imigran today as this is the only thing that works.  Unfortunately I now have to wait 24hrs until I can take them.  This is torture when you are expected to function at work and look after children at home.  I am so glad that Maxalt has worked for many of you.  In my case it is Imigran that works well for me so I am still unsure why the doctor prescribed Maxalt.  If you find a good thing_ stick to it!  Good luck everyone.,F,41,7  days10mg 1X D,2/12/2012Email,Maxalt-mlt
19, 5, migraines,Very few--mainly more fatigue.,Maxalt MLT is the only drug that works on my migraines. Imitrex_ Relpax_ etc. just don't work.  I love the MLT as I typically throw up if I don't catch the migraine soon enough.  This drug works within 30 minutes of taking it and as long as I've taken it early enough_ always works. I use the 5mg_ as the 10mg makes my chest feel tight (kinda freaky).  For a migraine sufferer_ this is a wonderful drug.,F,43,5  years5 1X AN,1/20/2012,Maxalt-mlt
20, 4, very sick headaches,None that i can remember,it helps more often than not_ as long as it is the melt and not the pill because I am so nauseated from the headache I can't keep anything down. I have also tried Sumavel needlefree injection (sumatriptan) and I do have a prescription for Zomig 2.5mg that sometimes works if I can catch it in time before the nausea sets in. The Maxalt is a lifesaver when it works it's a true miracle and that is exactly what I need when I'm sick like that because I can't even get out of bed. On the rare occasions I have made it to the doctor or ER I have gotten injections of Toradol which work like a charm as well as injections for the nausea. But like others have said here it is extremely expensive_ I am on Medicaid and I can only get two doses at a time. My neurologist has prescribed Zomig nasal spray which comes 12 individual doses to a box and two boxes costs over $500.00....I know ridiculous_ huh? But it does work although I need to keep from swallowing too much of the spray since it may make me sick if I swallow it_ but it works. The injections were too difficult for me to use as I'm often too weak to do it correctly. So I can only hope somehow the drugs will come down in price because I'd be in trouble if I lost my insurance or they wouldn't pay for it.,F,53,1  years5mg 1X D,1/16/2012Email,Maxalt-mlt

23, 1, Migraine,pretty much all of them but very mild and brief.  Seemed to be the same side effects as Imitrex. Hot flashes_ slight nausea_ kind of a wind burn feeling on the surface of the skin. All very mild though,I tried Maxalt as a sample from my doc_ i have been taking Sumatriptan for about five years now and asked for some alternatives when i started having trouble with my regular script not working as well as it had in the past. He gave me two of the 10mg melts and i tried them the next time i felt a migraine coming on. They did absolutely nothing for me except give me some of the side effects. There was not even the slightest relief from the headache so i took the second at about three hours after the first and still nothing. The worst part was now i could not take anything else for 24 hours and it was miserable. I have not had to deal with a full on migraine in years having been able to knock them out with my regular script. Incidentally i think the issue with my current script stems from when my pharmacy switched from Dr Reddys to Sun Pharma_ i have discussed with my doc and will try going back to Dr Reddys or switch to Treximet. I have read here that Maxalt has worked well but for some reason it had no effect at all for me. Good luck out there people_ hope everyone finds their relief.,M,45,1  days10mg 1X D,11/14/2011Email,Maxalt-mlt

25, 5, Severe Migraine Headaches,I'm very tired and cry for a few hours afterwards.,I have been suffering for about a year and a half and refused to take the Imitrex.  I had no choice but to break down and take the Maxalt for the first time on Sunday.  My headache got worse and then immediately better in 20 minutes.  It's a miracle drug.

26, 5, migraine,None!,This med works awesome for me!  I put the tab under my tongue and my migraine is completely gone in 5 minutes.  I had previously tried Imitrex_ Amerge_ and Midrin with no success.  I have no side effects with Maxalt_ and my whole body feels relaxed after taking it.  I did notice that the regular Maxalt (the tab you swallow) didn't work as well for me as the tab you put under your tongue that melts.  I do wish this drug had a generic though because it is very expensive and my new insurance is giving me a hard time with prior authorizations trying to get it:(,F,28,2  years10 1X AN,9/22/2011,Maxalt-mlt
27, 5, Chronic migraines,None!,I've suffered migraines for 15 years (since I was 5) and I've never experienced anything like this medicine! For me it takes about an hour to work_ so I have to take it as soon as I start noticing visual disturbances_ but I can actually feel it kicking in and making the headache go away.

29, 5, Severe chronic migraine,Drowsiness_ drugged/dopey feeling.  Worse by far is the awful_ awful full-body aches from Maxalt_ from top of head to soles of feet (this side effect has gotten worse over the years).  Even my eyelids and the palms of my hands hurt.  Eating (once migraine nausea subsides) helps relieve the body aches.,Imitrex nasal spray worked for me for years until one day it didn't (and never did again).  Tried other triptans but Maxalt is my go-to. Gives fast_ long-lasting relief_ drowsiness is not so bad as to be debilitating.  But the body aches are awful_ and have gotten worse over the years.  Feel like I've been beaten_ lasts about 8 hours.  But still better than suffering out a migraine.  A good preventive routine (mine is bystolic_ a beta blocker) and a rescue prescription (mine is toradol injections) help too.

31, 5," To ""break"" a migraine headache.",No side effects whatsoever.,"I suffered from migraine headaches (""grade 3"" level--the worst ones) my entire life. Although I never took any time off while at school_ and later work_ it was very difficult to deal with even the simplist of daily tasks. Advil worked some of the time. After one very bad stretch of migraines (6 month period_ shortest time between migraines was one hour_ longest migraine was 10 days in length.)_ I had enough. I spoke to my doctor. I was put on Amitriptyline to help control the migraine cycle_ and Maxalt Rapid Tabs to ""break"" the migraines. Maxalt will not work if the headache is not a migraine. If it is one_ Maxalt usually works inside of 10 minutes for me. If the migraine fades back but remains_ Advil usually ""breaks"" the remainder. I do feel drowsy after a migraine ""breaks"" but this is a normal reaction for me and is an after-effect of the migraine itself_ not the medication I have taken. (There were many times I had not taken anything at all for a migraine_ and when it finally ""broke""_ I would feel drowsy until the next day.).  Although it may not have the same successful result for everyone_ I would recommend a migraine sufferer to give it a try.",F,47,5  years10 mg 1X AN,2/12/2011,Maxalt-mlt
32, 2, Migraines,I did not experience any side effects.,This started out as a wonder drug for me. However_ as time wore on_ it seemed that the Maxalt was only postponing the migraine. It would start on the left side of my face. I'd take the pill and in half an hour it was gone. The next day it would be on the right. I'd take another and it would go. The next day_ it would be on the left again. This last time_ I just called in sick and toughed it out with Gravol like I used to_ and it has definitely gone. Other times I would need two pills to get rid of the migraine. Then it would recur_ as usual_ a few days later. Even my doctor_ who uses Maxalt_ agrees that there's some kind of rebound effect_ that the body almost requires the migraine to do whatever it's supposed to do!,F,51,1  years10 mg 2X D,2/2/2011,Maxalt-mlt

I was worried about side effects_ but they were not a big issue -  a migraine will put me too bed with either way. My head still feels calm and clear a day later. I think it really broke the cycle! I haven't been this pain free in weeks. I guess sometimes you don't realize what you put up with on a regular basis until it is gone. It also has wiped out a lot of muscle tension throughout my body- I can see how this could be a bit much for some_ but for me it's a good thing.,F,40,1  days10 MG 1X D,1/5/2011,Maxalt-mlt

I was absolutely amazed with the results the second time I took it... I could still function_ instead of the headache hitting 10 on the richter scale it was more a 3-4 and everytime I take it the headache is less and less. I don't vomit_ which I nearly always did before. To me this drug is a miracle_ I don't get migraines that often but when I did they would take a whole day from me...

I've had migraines since I was a child_ getting worse over the years_ with and without aura. I get 15+ a month. Ugh. I've been on tons of drugs to prevent (haven't found one that works yet) and to abort. I was prescribed Maxalt about 8 years ago after trying all the narcotics_ Imitrex etc. It was a life saver. It has ""weakened"" a bit in efficacy over the years_ sometimes I may need to take it with three advil or take two in order for it to kick a headache in the butt_ but it still does it's job wonderfully. I honestly don't know how I survived without it. I also get rebound migraines after taking a triptan and Maxalt has the least frequency of this happening. Doctors keep trying to get me to switch to other triptans_ not sure why but Maxalt seems like one of their least favs of the triptans_ and I keep coming back to it.

My doctor prescribed it to take as needed with advil to take care of my migraines. Worked well except for the slightly tilted vision and severe itching of the face. I don't know if those side effects are typical though. All in all I'd say I was very satisfied with this medicine. It's been the most effective one yet for me.,F,15, 10 MG 1X AN,9/20/2010,Maxalt-mlt

The headache did kick in but it was nothing compared to the usual pain I experience. I also took 3 Advil and was able to function for the rest of the day which I have never been able to do in the 17 years I've been a migraine sufferer.

When ever I take a Maxalt my pain in shoulder area and upper back is better for at lest 24 hours.,F,52, 10 mg 1X D,6/1/2010Email,Maxalt-mlt
52, 5, Migraine.,None_ save perhaps for slight drowsyness but I always need to sleep after recovery usually.,A lifesaver for me. Suffered with terrible migraines for 40 years. I had suffered with them since my teens and got used to them getting them once a month or every week in later life. I thought it was natural to get one having them for so long.- over 40 years!Finally went to doctors (yes after all that time!) as it was getting too much for me getting older. Doc prescribed Maxalt and next time a migraine started I took half a pill and lay down. half hour later it has stopped were before I would have been looking at 12 hours minimum of throwing up and head torture.Then 24 hours to recover. Now 9 times out of 10 this wonder pill stops a migraine in its tracks. I usually only have to take half pill too. Bliss. I thought migraines were a way of life I had got so used to them over the years. Funny thing was after 40 years I cut out sugar after hearing Jack l'Laine (spelling?)fitness guru_ on the radio in 2005 saying he used to have headaches and cut sugar out of his diet and never got one again. I tried that (stopped  sugar as much asI could)and found that YES_ Sugar sets mine off! So I cut sugar out and I rarely get a Migraine now unless I eat sugary things (and No I am not diabetic) but if I do these pills save me.Thankyou.,M,56, 5 - 10 mg 1X AN,5/21/2010Email,Maxalt-mlt

It starts off a small blob in the centre of my vision and after about 10mins it can go across the whole of my sight_ sometimes only one eye is affected but it does happen in both usually. This has happened when I have been driving and I have had to stop the car as its got so bad its become to dangerous to drive as I can't see the road or other vehicles on it. This can last for hours.I don't actually get pain till the next day once the sight thing as gone away_ then I feel sick and get a pain in my haed like there is a sledge hammer in it. Doctor first gave me Zydol pain killers for the headaches which are to strong for me  and made me feel drousy_so thats why I have changed to Maxalt Melt. I must admit I was a bit worried at first about taking it_ but it worked after 40mins and my sight returned to normal. Absolutely great.,F,34,6  times,10/3/2009Email,Maxalt-mlt

I take half a tablet at the at the start of the headache_ and relief comes within one to one-and a-half hours. Maybe once in 25 times I'll have to take the second half. My headaches are different than usual cluster headaches in that they will last 6 to 12 hours if untreated.  I take 900 mg of lithium and 320 mg verapamill daily as a preventative_ but all that does is reduce the severity of 8-10 to 4-6_ doesn't help frequency.,M,72,2  years,9/5/2009,Maxalt-mlt

65, 5, migraines,a bit sleepy - can ignore this_ though_ by keeping busy.....,LOVE this medication.  One advantage to Maxalt over Imitrex (which didn't work as well anyway) is that it can be taken without water so it's easily transportable.  The dissolving tablet avoids the other problem I had with Imitrex - throwing it up_ since water could upset my stomach.  Have been cutting the tablet in half when headache is mild - seems to work although may need to take other half later.   Also_ am pleased with the fresh minty taste.,F,62,10  years,8/13/2009,Maxalt-mlt

I now have a perscription and haven't had a headache since !!!  Sometimes I have to take them daily for several days during my cycle - but the headaches are gone.

No adverse side effects however.,"This drug changed my life_ made it possible to work a full day_ made it possible to get back to a normal life. I had been taking Zomig in pill form_ but it lost effectivness over a three year period. I have been taking Maxalt for a least seven years I think. It is the silver bullet iwas looking for.     I now also take 20mg ofNortriptyline as a preventative measure. This has cut down my Maxalt use to almost nothing. If you are a female with hormonal related Migrane headaches i recomend talking to your provider about this preventative measure. I did not want to take ""One more drug""... My doc talked me into giving it a try and for the first time in over twenty years I feel great_ and am pain free all month long.

76, 5, severe migraines,none at all,In the past 2 years my migraines went from needing to lay down for the day in a cool quiet dark place to completely unbearable to the point where I'd consider suicide as the only alternative to rid myself of this indescribable pain. Still they only came once every couple months until suddenly I started to get them every day for weeks straight sometimes once every few hours. I couldn't function in the slightest and even now having Maxalt MLT it is still sometimes difficult to get to the pill and to open it but within 30 minutes of it dissolving I feel as if I never had a migraine! It is a miracle. I have been taking them for over a year now and sometimes such as lately have to take them every day for a couple weeks straight and they still work perfectly every time. The taste isn't bad either_ tastes a little like an altoid_ or one of those listerine dissolving mints strips.

Typically Furinol was the only thing that helped_ but over the past few months I developed a headache that stayed with me no matter what I tried_ including Furinol. A new doctor prescribed Maxalt and it seems to do the trick. The fact that it dissolves also helps due to my severe stomach ulcer and bowel issues. I typically cannot take pain killers in tablet form without it completely tearing me up.

125, 5, Migraine Headaches,None for me.,Maxalt is designed to shorten the nerves around your brain to minimize the vibration to lessen the effects of a headache - NOT to get rid of it. It is NOT a narcotic_ and not intended to give those effects. You are supposed to take it as soon as you feel a headache (Aura) coming on_ and if you do_ like me_ you will (hopefully) barely feel any different than normal. For me_ this drug _ along with Topomax (75mg twice daily) keeps me off floor. Before these drugs_ I went through everything in the books to no effect. I've had migranes since I was 16 and my doctors think that another few months on Topomax and I might be able to start to go off of it and be headache free!,M,42,3  years,9/12/2007Email,Maxalt-mlt

129, 5, Head ache/ Inner ear infedction,NONE,Not only did this drug get rid of the headache I'd had for a week_ I later found that it also got rid of dizziness.   My doctor perscibed this drug when I told her I'd had 3 migrains in my entire life.  The ones that make you want to vomit and even after the headahce is gone it feles like you have been hit in the head with a hammer.  So the doctor gave me Maxalt MLT 10 mg  and 4 boxes.  Seems a little much for a person who has only had a few of those.  But after realizing it gets rid of dizziness and headaches asprin just can't get rid of. I will swear by this drug!

Head feels a bit cloudy sometimes_ but these effects are acceptable to me.",I'd say 80% of the time Maxalt works great for me. But I've started getting headaches more frequently and Maxalt has failed a few times. The most recent one_ I took the pill in the morning_ and it didn't work. Then I took another one later that day before bedtime_ and it worked. Not sure if all my headaches are actually migraines or a combination of muscle spasms in my neck and shoulder causing migraine-like pain and tension headaches_ but Maxalt seems to work the majority of the time. Other times a little coffee helps with some Tylenol. (I don't drink coffee on a regular basis_ so this works sometimes for me.),F,28,5  years,4/30/2007,Maxalt-mlt

139, 4, migraine,none,Maxalt took away my headache. Problem was that it kept coming back. I took 5 doses in 2 days and then I ran out. The next day I had a headache with nausea so bad that I thought I would die. That happens almost every month at PMS time_ so I don't think it was caused by the Maxalt. My doctor switched me to Imitrex_ so I have that ready for the next time_ but I am scared of the side effects I've been reading about.,F,38,2  days,3/10/2007,Maxalt-mlt
140, 5, Cluster headaches,No side effects what-so-ever!,I was nervous to try it because of the listed side effects. However_ I took it and suffered from no side effects.

(Seems worse in the spring)  I did nothing for so long_ but suffer and then was prescribed maxalt.  It has helped so much!  I get headaches from caffeine_ so some over the counter medications could not even be tried.  But_ this does the trick_ if I watch and take it at the first hint of a headache and don't think it will just go away on it's own.  (UM_ that has never happened_ so why do I think that?)

However_ the day following I usually have some gastrointestinal upset (gurgly stomach) and occasionally diahrrea if I eat the wrong thing_ so I usually stay home and rest anyway.,I LOVE LOVE LOVE Maxalt. Provided it is taken at the very first signs of an attack_ it works wonders. If I wait too long_ it does also help_ but takes longer and I might get nauseated and a very stiff neck (that's the migraine attack) before it puts me to sleep.,F,32,3  years,1/28/2007,Maxalt-mlt

Sleepy is just fine with me!!,Even if I don't take it at the first sign of pain_ 95% of the time it still works great.  For me it can work within 20 to 30 minutes. I have told many people with migraines_ if their current meds are not working...try Maxalt MLT! And really_ to dissolve with no water......can't beat that!,F,44,5  years,1/28/2007,Maxalt-mlt
147, 4, migraine,Dry mouth feels 'puffy' after I've taken it.  Feel nicely drowsy and unbothered.,It is fantastic that this pill does take away the pain for me.  I was used to regular (once or twice a month) two day shut-in-a-dark-room_ sick and unable to take the pain sessions_ and now I can enjoy myself_ about half an hour after taking it.  I did quite like th slightly 'out of it' feeling it gave me_ though now like this less as I feel it is unreality. If I push it e.g. go to work and get stressed teaching_I need more pills and the migraine just goes on in the background in a horrible way. I am a bit worried about long term effects as I now regularly take Maxalt.Usually on weekends it works great but recently had unexpected migraine attacks coming on - maybe they getting more frequent? THis is the second this week! I want to reach for the pills - but I do sometimes get strange cramp/ spasm from chest to stomach pains that I didn't have before and wonder what they are. I hope I can go on taking MAxalt as they do work wonders for the pain like no other pill has.,F,48,2  years,1/9/2007,Maxalt-mlt

Then by the third month it stopped being as effective.-I have certain doubts this medication causes rebound headaches after a certain time.

Otherwise I get few to no side effects except I often get a weird sensation in the back of my neck (hard to explain) and my throat sometimes feels like it is thicker/closing up slightly.  These sensations are transient and do not trouble me.,Usually works very well as long as I take it at the very first signs of a migraine coming on (if I wait until the pain has arrived it's not typically so helpful).  The MLT tab works much more effectively and much faster for me than the regular solid pill.,F,29,2  years,11/15/2006,Maxalt-mlt

I love that I am able to put a few packets in every purse I have so that I'm always with them.  More than once_ the fact that it is orally disintegrating has saved me from a miserable day.  The tablets aren't the best tasting; I found it best to put it all the back on my tongue so that I wasn't stuck with the taste all day.,F,28,1  years,10/2/2006,Maxalt-mlt

153, 5, Migraines,None,Before Maxalt_ I tried Advil Liquid Migraine and all that did was absolutely nothing. Maxalt is an excellent drug! Within 3-5 minutes_ I feel my migraine subsiding. The other day_ I woke up with a migraine and stopped at the pharmacy on my way to work to get more Maxalt. I took the pill while I was driving and before I even got to work the headache was gone. Sometimes you will need the second pill within the 24hr period but most of the time I don't. They are pretty expensive. (It costs me $55 for 6 pills with insurance). Overall highly recommended. One thing to note though_ I found an article on www.webmd.com that taking migraine medicine and an SSRI can cause serotonin syndrome_ which can be life threatening.,F,22,6  months,9/3/2006,Maxalt-mlt
154, 5, Migraines,None,Totally love this drug.  I love that it dissolves instantly_ so when I'm nauseous_ I know I'll still get the benefit of the drug.  It works for me within an hour.

I've tried Imitrex and it just doesn't work for me and actually made me the migraines worse and I got very sick afterward.  I have to take the Maxalt almost as soon as I feel the migraine coming on though_ or else it doesn't work.  I recently began taking Topamax as a preventative and I've noticed that I may be getting rebound headaches from taking the Maxalt with the Topamax.,F,22,10  months,7/12/2006,Maxalt-mlt

Before I was diagnosed with migraines I had tried every OTC pain reliever and they didn't help at all_ and I was getting 2 or 3 migraines a week that lasted for most of the day.  The first time I took Maxalt it was like a miracle.  I do feel pretty sleepy and spacy after taking it_ but if I take a short nap I wake up and my migraine is gone and I feel great.,F,22,1  years,6/24/2006,Maxalt-mlt
161, 5, Frequent Migraines,Slight drowsiness_ tingling in jaw area when tasting something immediately after drug starts taking effect.,This is by far my drug of choice when I get a migraine.  I've tried all triptans on the market_ this one works the fastest and best for me with the fewest side effects.  I like that you can take 3 in 24 hrs_ when I get a really bad migraine it often last for several days and keeps coming back.  Each dose of Maxalt usually takes the pain away for at least 5-6 hours at a time.  Now when it's mild one and I catch it early_ one Maxalt will do the trick.  If you really want relief from chronic migraines and want to solve the problem at the source_ see an Atlas Orthagonal Chiropracter and a Neuromuscular Dentist if you have had extensive dental work done and feel your bite may be off.  I suffered horribly for a year and all the neurologists would do was give me drugs.  I finally found the answers myself and wish I had of known sooner how to get to the source of the migraines.

I take 10 mg_ and one dose so far for each migraine has been enough. (Although I may have to take another the next day.) Maxalt works almost all of the time and within 40 minutes.  When it doesn't work_ I find that eating something often helps jump-start it.  Maxalt has kept me out of the ER. Don't care for strong mint-like taste_ though.  It's very expensive_ too. Bless the people who have developed this medication.,F,50,3  years,12/7/2004,Maxalt-mlt
