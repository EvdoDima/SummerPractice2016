0, 1, Panic Disorder_ GAD,Horrible constipation_ low blood pressure_ low heart rate_ dizziness,This medication is dangerous if you're small and your BP runs on the low end of normal like me. It made my heart rate and blood pressure go down to the point where I almost fainted. The constipation it caused_ along with the effexor constipation_ was unbearable. Plus it stopped working after 2 weeks. I see so many success stories about how it's helped people with their PTSD and anxiety_ I'm unfortunately not one of them.,F,20,2  months1 mg 1X D,12/29/2015,Prazosin hcl
1, 5, PTSD,I highly recommend this med.  it stops the nightmares completely .  I awake refreshed ( never groggy or with a headache ) I was able to function without intrusive horrific memories .,,F,36,4  years1mg,9/6/2014Email,Prazosin hcl
2, 5, PTSD,none,helps to sleep,M,44,3  years5 mg 2X D,12/28/2012,Prazosin hcl
3, 5, PTSD nightmares,blurred vision_ nausea; I take 4 mg,I take a Pepsid with it and I'm fine.  I've gone from disfunctional at least a whole day after a nightmare_ to waking up just fine.  The vision is an issue_ but worth the benefits.  I also don't need a sleeping med at night; the prazosin fixes that problem too.,F,26,10  weeks,2/8/2009Email,Prazosin hcl
4, 4, PTSD nightmares,No side effects,It has helped my nightmares_ but they are still present.,F,26,1  years,6/5/2007,Prazosin hcl
5, 4, pheochromocytoma,I have not had any side effects from this drug.  It does not keep my blood pressure down like the Norvasc that I was taking for a while before being dianogised with pheo. Taking a dose of 6 capsules per day.,Hope it is working the way it should_ I am sure they will let me kow when I go back in Although they have just added Atenolol_ but I am cold all the time until I have the sweats which are one of the symptoms of the tumor.,F,47,70  days,6/14/2005Email,Prazosin hcl
