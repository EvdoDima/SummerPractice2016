0, 1, Hepatitis C,RIBA + INF.  A slow slog thru hell.  Anemia_ psoriasis much worse_ debility_ living without joy.  I stopped taking this stuff the day I found that the HCV therapy was not working.  A long time before I recovered.,,M,64,140  daysUnknown 3X W,9/9/2011Email,Rebetol
1, 3, Hep C,After effects: Hyperthyroid (Grave's Disease)_ premature menopause_ compromised immune system_ granuloma annulare_ hair loss_ muscle spasms_ weakness_ depression_ 'chemo brain',Did the full year treatment with interferon for Hep C_ a devastating experience that included ALL side effects listed for drug.  I often wonder if the cure wasn't worse than the disease.  Am now free of Hep C viral load_ but accompanying after effects have created new problems.,F,52,1  years,4/22/2008,Rebetol
2, 1, hepatitis C,Join www_hcop.org for the real scoop on this supposed cure. Honestly_ viral load is in no way related to liver health.,do a lot of research before deciding to take this drug_ long term after effects can be much more serious than learning to manage hepC. Yes_ learning to manage hepC is not only possible_ it may be much safer.,M,55, ,11/9/2007,Rebetol
3, 5, Hep C,Achy Flu feeling_ nausous when hungry_insomnia,I took this med with Interferon and was cured of Hep C in only 3 months_ but still had to continue the meds for another 3 months.  My side effects were not as bad as I heard they could have been_ because I followed the directions by not drinking caffiene_ I don't smoke or take any other drugs_ and I made sure to drink lots or water and exercise.  Since depression could have been a side effect_ I avoided watching anything sad on TV or movies.,F,52,6  months,11/11/2006,Rebetol
4, 3, Hep C,Nausea_ weight loss_ hair loss_ eyebrow loss_ excema_ loss of thyroid function_damage to eyesight_ hemolytic aneminia and ovarian failure leading to premature menopause.,I did a 6 month induction protocol using this drug combo in much higher doses then usual followed by 6 months of conventional dosage. I cleared the virus at great cost to my overall health. 6 years later I am still being treated for  some of the long term side effects. I give this a 3 because I was not sick when I went into treatment_ and although I was cured I was very sick for a long time afterwards.,F,52,1  years,9/27/2006,Rebetol
5, 4, Hep C,hypothyroid_diabetes_brain fog_weight gain,I cleared the virus but now feel debilitated. I was not told of these possibilities. Depression not a problem-was on zoloft and trazadone already.,F,55,12  days,1/24/2006,Rebetol
