3, 2, Major Depressive Disorder,Decreased libido and emotional numbness,All antidepressants can affect libido_ but Lexapro killed the little bit of sex drive I had left.  The biggest issue_ though_ is that it's made me totally numb_ emotionally.  I don't feel sad_ but I don't feel anger_ empathy_ or love either.  I just feel empty.  I'm so done with this medicine.,F,37,2  months30mg 1X D,7/11/2016Email,Lexapro
4, 1, GAD,dizzy_ headache_ felt in a fog_ agitated_ nausea,My GAD hasn't been terrible over the years.  Overall I handled it without requiring drugs.  Infrequently took .25 alprazolam for tougher events.  Having a particularly rough year with many stressful events occurring at the same time.  Saw my doctor about this and the increased anxiety and he suggested I try Lexapro (alprazolam OK as needed).  So I haven't had such a difficult time with anxiety under normal circumstances over the years.  Felt so terrible with only two days of Lexapro (way worse than any anxiety I've felt) that I knew that it wasn't for me.  I stopped taking it and will try to manage without drugs.... step up exercise... try meditation/relaxation techniques.,F,63,2  days10 1X D,7/10/2016,Lexapro

It took a long time to figure out what was causing the horrible acid reflux that come on suddenly and cough_ but I'm convinced it's a side effect of the Lexapro.

17, 2, To treat depression,I had vivid dreams that I could not distinguish from realitity and memory. I had to use logic to come to understand that these dreams Did not happen. This is a side effect my therapist didn't even know was possible. It meant I wasted a lot of time looking for things that didn't exist. But the worse episode for me was when I had a dream that my younger brother had been dead for a decade. I was alone in my dorm room at the time and so it took me an hour to realize he was still alive.Also_ the medication only has an affect on my mood if I am taking caffine as well. This was an accidental discovery for me as I have worried I am caffine sensitive like both my parents are.,,,19,5  months5mg - 20mg,4/6/2016Email,Lexapro

This drug made it almost impossible to function as I was napping for 1-2 hours after work and would sleep for 10 hours every night and was still falling asleep at work.,This medicine helped to shut off my racing/obsessive thoughts almost completely. It was so nice to have a clear mind and not be overwhelmed by every day tasks that used to get me panicked. I genuinely never realised just how active my mind was until I started taking this medicine. Unfortunately the drowsiness was unbearable for me and I found it almost impossible to function  or move.

I felt super calm but not flat like I did on Zoloft.   I finally have been weaning off due to the sexual side effects and weight gain around my middle.  I felt like I looked pregnant_ it was awful.  I have been weaning off_ going from 20 to 15 to 10 to 5 to a tiny piece a week apart for each dosage.  I stopped altogether 2 weeks ago and the electricity running through my head is pretty bad.  That seems to be the only side effect for me going off.  I started taking Wellbutrin and it seems to help with some of that.,F,53,9  months20 1X D,11/8/2015,Lexapro

I couldn't be sad and I couldn't care about anything. It was a relief.,"- Most people don't start on 20mg_ it was an emergency. - If you have an ""inner critic""_ it takes that voice away and you feel like you're allowed to feel happy again.- DO NOT STOP COLD TURKEY. I stopped after three months because I felt better. I gained ten pounds. The depression took about for months after to come back. Not pleasant.- Loved this drug_ but if you don't like the feeling of uninterrupted calm_ I don't recommend it. You aren't overly happy or overly sad_ just stable.",F,21,3  months20,10/15/2015,Lexapro

46, 5, Post Partum depression and GAD,"First two weeks were a nightmare. I had no clue it was the side effect from the lexapro. I checked myself into the ER 3x in one week certain that I was dying. I vomited for three days straight. Heart palpitations for 2 weeks. Along with the ""brain zaps"" people tell about. And a feeling of eminent doom 24/7. Like you just saw a dog get hit by a car. They ran entire body scans and told me I was the healthiest person ever. Visited the psychologist who prescribed me and he promised if I just stuck with it_ it would pass. And he was right! Almost exactly after the second week I woke up one morning and I felt 100% better.  Xanax was the godsend to get me through the side effects. Take it as prescribed and it is your best friend.",I've read nothing but negative reviews on this drug. Some people even claim that the first day of taking the pill it was either aweful or amazing. Just know that you WILL NOT feel any effect for 3-5 days as it takes time for it to build up in your body. I started taking this for my Post Partum. I was to the point that if I even looked at my baby or heard his voice I wanted to vomit. I wanted nothing to do with him. I wanted him away from me as far as possible. I knew there was something wrong with that_ so I spoke to a psychologist and he prescribed me lexapro. I started off on 2.5 mg for one week. Then 5 the next week (those 2 weeks were the worst) then  I worked up to 10mg. I felt so much better but I still had the feeling of uneasiness. So he bumped me up to 15. That was the magic number. I was totally back to normal.  It's been 1yr now and my little baby is now 1.5 yrs old. I feel like I don't need it any more. So my dr has me stepping off. I've gradually taken down the dose by 2.5mgs each month just to be sure I don't experience withdrawals and guess what?! THERE HAVE BEEN NONE!!! Yay. I'm literally down to my last 30 days of this medicine and I feel awesome!DO NOT JUST QUIT COLD TURKEY. you must must must gradually lower the dose by a month at a time or you will suffer TERRIBLE consequences.,F,32,10  months15,9/1/2015Email,Lexapro
47, 1, severe depression_ panic disorder_,"My psych doc has tried me on every medication and medication combo possible. He decided to try Lexapro 20mg even though I had a bad reaction to Citalopram (same drug class). By day 2 I was feeling pretty good_ that night went into a seriously deep depression and had a bad panic attack in the middle of the night. Now_ day 4_ it's hard for me to get myself to go anywhere_ do anything or even be happy. I go back and forth either having a hard time sleeping or constantly being tired. Additionally_ I'm now snapping at people ""at the drop of a dime"" for stupid reasons and my heart rate increases to the point that it feels like it's going to burst out my chest. On top of that_ it takes HOURS for me to calm down after becoming agitated/angry over petty things and then I'm just exhausted. I'm a really calm and laid back person. I don't get angry or frustrated easily_ let alone growl at people. I'm also dizzy and unbalanced to the point that I can't walk straight and run into things or lose balance.

Start up side effects are common and can really stink_ but they do end.,F,26,1  days10 mg,8/6/2015,Lexapro
55, 4, Major Depression_ General Anxiety, - my mind feels a bit slower_ however this may simply be because I no longer constantly ruminate and feel more relaxed.  I have trouble getting motivated_ though I am thankfully able to stay motivated once I finally get started.   - constricted affect (clinical term).  Basically_ I don't feel things as deeply as I used to.  In a way it's good because I no longer wallow in misery in order to drive my creativity (which nearly led me to suicide several times).  However_ I have lost my creative drive in general as a result.  Every emotional stimulus feels watered down_ but then maybe I only feel that way because I assumed my prior hypersensitivity was normal_ even though it wasn't healthy.   - diminished libido and sexual sensitivity_ both physically and psychologically.  Even though I can achieve and maintain erections and I still feel pleasure_ it is difficult for me to orgasm.,Overall_ Lexapro is an extremely effective drug for eliminating deep depression and I recommend it wholeheartedly_ regardless of the side effects.  Lexapro has kept me in remission for almost 5 years now_ which has allowed me to make important behavioral and life changes so that hopefully someday I won't need it anymore.  I will say this_ however - if you are serious about curing your depression_ do not rely on the meds to do all the work for you.  Meds get the depression in remission so that you are capable of making whatever changes necessary to sustain remission upon cessation of treatment.  Harsh sacrifices have to be made if you want to get through this.  The side effects of this drug can take a serious existential toll in your life.  For me_ my lack of libido and emotional sensitivity has made it very difficult to develop romantic relationships.  I also lost my creativity_ which had defined me as a person for most of my life.  At first glance_ this may seem too steep a price_ but I am at the point now where I realize that giving up those things actually helped me to focus on recovering from past abuse that I had ignored_ as well as learn healthier coping mechanisms for dealing with stress and how to avoid negative thought patterns.  I have also been able to learn about love and healthy relationships from an objective viewpoint before jumping in naive and unprepared.  Ultimately_ I now have a more positive outlook on life.,M,26,5  years20mg 1X D,8/3/2015Email,Lexapro

My doctor says I have to ride it out until it works. But I don't know if I can bear it any longer. For the fear I take Oxaxepam. I know this is a dangerous drug in the long run. Two years ago I was addicted to it_ als because of initial side effects. (of Prozac)  Now_ I was using Lexapro for two years and it was working very good_ so I thought it was time to stop it. This was a BIG MISTAKE. Because of that I am now in a hell-situation where I don't know what to do anymore. Every evening I say to myself_ tomorrow I will go to work for half a day. And everytime I do not manage because of the fear and the drowsiness of the Oxaxepam. I do not have enough help. Is there anybody out there who has any good advi,So Lexapro helped me very good foor two years. Only I almost can not stand the initial side effects.

104, 5, Depression and anxiety,I have experienced lower energy which I think might be related to Lexapro.  I take Wellbutrin (generic) to boost my energy.,"I had lifelong struggles with ""the blues""_ but right after my 40th birthday_ I experienced intense anxiety_ followed by a depression that was a nightmare.  I tried a few different SSRI's before trying Lexapro.  Lexapro is a lifesaver for me. I have tried to go off it_ but experienced depression and anxiety. Unfortunately_ I have not had success with the generic type.  Lexapro also helps me control ruminating thoughts-ie worries_ fears_ anxieties_ or morbid thoughts.  I was always a worried and with Lexapro_ I can ""compartmentalize"" problems and let go of concerns much more easily-like a ""normal"" person.",F,51,10  years-,12/11/2014,Lexapro

So trying in a.m. Slight very slight loose bowels.,"People need to understand about SSRI's that just taking for under 2-3 wks doesn't give the drug time to work. Yes_ you will have some sideeffects an everyone is diff on that. Your body is adjusting to the new drug. Your brain chemicals control everything in your body so yes you will have adjusting sideeffects.  I know this. I'm on 5mg @ night now for 10days. Haven't noticed a ""light bulb is on now"" effect yet but its only been 10 days! Some of these take 3-4 wks or up to 8 wks to be effective. Im switching to a.m. an make sure I eat food first in case of nausea.  Hopefully not sleepy in afternoon.  Not planning on going up in dosage until 3-4 wks. Do have rapid heart beat but I think thats fr adjusting to it. Give these meds a chance. It rarely starts helping in 5 days!! An you might feel worse before you feel better thats just the way it is. After 2-3 mnths an still having sideeffects that are effecting your quality of life_ go to Dr!",F,46,10  days5mg generi,12/10/2014,Lexapro

Long story short I told the love of my life that I was addicted to these painkillers and she took it as I was being dishonest with her and she stopped trusting me and left me. That's when I knew i needed help for my anxiety/depression. Till this day she dose not know any of this. Just thinks I was being a irresponsible person who wanted to get high. Now we co-parent 50/50 but till this day she dose not know that I have been to embarrassed to admit this to anyone and lived with this eating at me for 30 years. Moral of the story is life is so short.so A. - If you need help DONT wait! Ask today! And B.- Why should I have to feel any other way then normal?

I can't be strict with my daughter when she misbehaves because I always end up laughing or giggling lol!   It seems like nothing can get me mad or upset and this is the exact effect that I wanted as well as my anxiety and depression under control and my mood stabilizing.  I do feel numb at times_ like I don't feel anything at all_ but it isn't necessarily a bad thing compared to being as over emotional as I was. I do feel extremely tired_ but nothing a cup of coffee can't fix lol_ and I do have some memory loss_ or a hard time remembering_ as well as difficulty concentrating_ but again it's nothing even close to being unbearable or anything serious.

188, 1, Depression (supposedly)_ fatigue,Initially vivid dreams. Delayed ejaculation and eventually erectile disfunction although it may have been age (50) that bought that on. Coming off the drug produced lightheadedness_ 'brain zaps' or resets_ sleep issues_ mood swings.,Advice for mildly depressed persons or those (and their doctors) who cant put a finger on what is wrong with them. Don't take these drugs unless you have exausted all avenues to find out what is wrong. This includes counselling as well as general health issues and diet etc. I believe that my erectile disfunction is due to years of Lexapro use. My problem was partially fixed by Testosterone therapy using Reandron.

Between being depressed for years_ and then taking this drug_ I still have not found much happiness. When I am okay_ it is just a numb sort of happiness. I don't socialize with people anymore_ really. I am amazed I even have a boyfriend. I'm just numb_ barely even there. I feel on the verge of insanity. I keep hoping I'll get hit by a bus or something. I'm honestly not sure whether I was better off or on this drug... the depression was horrible and unbearable. This is more mild_ but I'm still SO numb_ I've lost most of my sense of self. So really_ why not just die already? At least I can smile now_ sometimes.,M,21,3  years20mg 1X D,3/12/2013,Lexapro

Day 3: great! Social_ happy to have company_ emotionally well & stable. Again_ woke up at 4am (no anxiety) for no reason but fell asleep an hour later.

Now those have all faded and i have no more side effects except some mild sweating during the night and very very vivid dreams but nothing scary and much much more tolerable then the anxiety i was suffering. I spent weeks before trying this reading all the negative posts and things about it just being money for pharma. I also read about the withdrawals which do sound a bit scary but ill deal with that when the time comes!

I already had insomnia_ and taking this drug at night (because it made me groggy) along with my Ambien even made it take @3 hours to fall asleep. I'd be yawning but my mind was just on high alert_ wide awake.Absence of orgasm is the final straw. That has NEVER happened to me before.

225, 3, Pms symptoms,I was prescribed Lexapro by my gyno for severe PMS symptoms.  It took about 7-10 days to get used to it. After that it worked well for a while and then I had to take a higher dosage to alleviate my symptoms. I gained 8 lbs while taking. I can only attribute it to the Lexapro. I have eaten healthier and exercised more frequently and still gained weight.  I am now in the process of quitting it cold turkey.  Horrible!!!  I am on day 9 and am finally about 80% normal. I have spent the last several days in hell.  I have been very dizzy and completely exhausted. I would not recommend taking Lexapro unless you need it for depression symptoms. If I knew how awful the withdrawal would be i would never have taken it to begin with. I have learned a valuable lesson. Ask questions!

Still impulsive but not as severe. Basically_ this medicine rounds the sharp edges off. Metaphorically speaking_ I feel gray instead of just black and white. I am still very over-analitical. I do at times feel slightly ""zombified."" Relapse of bipolar was imminent when stopped meds due to pregnancy. Was told there was a 1 in 1000 chance of baby being born with congenital heart defect if I continued with medication. Had to start Lexapro again soon after labor.

Since I turned 30_ in addition to unfortunate life events_ I have ballooned up to 217lbs. It's difficult to function - even walk into a Starbucks. In fact_ I drive out of the way to go through the drive through Starbucks. I'm that embarrassed and anxiety ridden about myself. Recently_ I've started Lexapro. Boy_ was I terrified of gaining weight. I didn't need to add to my growing body or anxiety/depression.  My constant thoughts about food have FINALLY subsided with Lexapro. Today I took my dogs to a local state park and enjoyed the day without thinking about what or where my next meal would be.Additionally_ I've been sleeping better_ thinking better_ feeling more focused and have more energy.

Other than the initials side effects of tiredness and stomach acidity acting up_ this has pretty much been a miracle drug for me. I've not had one panic attack since I started taking this medication about a year ago_ whereas before I would usually have one a day.

I like this drug a lot. Much less talkative and less interested in sex. Probably because I no longer have so much anxiety (which made me talk a lot nonsense). Yay! Thumbs up lexapro.

244, 4, Anxiety and depression,The first couple of weeks were weird_ but no weirder than Zoloft.,"I remember that I felt like someone had wrapped my nerve endings with soft blankets.  Before Lexapro I felt that my nerves were just raw.  I felt everything so deeply.  I was told as a child that I was ""over sensitive.""  I think I'm an empath so that doesn't help matters.  I started out on 10 mgs and after 10 years thought that maybe I could taper down to 5 mgs.  I didn't think it was that hard_ but my daughters said I was acting a ""little strangely.""  Never good to hear.  After a year or so on 5 mgs. I realized that I was unstable.  For example_ I went to my new doctor for my first appointment and totally fell apart.  I was crying so hard that I couldn't talk!  She gently recommended upping the dosage back to 10 mgs which I did.  I guess the bottom line is this.  If you have GED and depression and are not able to function_ are sad everyday_ sometimes think about suicide then it would be a good idea to try and find something to make you feel better.

It caused anorgasmia_  though.  Three pills in and no orgasms or if I managed to climax after maximum effort_  it actually felt painful. I talked to the doctor_  we added Wellbutrin xl 150mg to combat the unwanted sexual side effects.  There was a very slight improvement. I lowered my Escitalopram to 5mg with barely any improvement. I got fed up and left my pill on the nightstand one evening about 3 weeks ago.  It's still there.  I stuck with the Wellbutrin_  though.  I knew I needed something to combat the PMS. About 2 weeks ago_  my orgasms refurned.  But also brain zaps_  dizziness_  night sweats_  nausea_ anxiety_  palpitations.  I refused to cave and take the pill.

266, 3, Anxiety_ OCD,I have had a headache for two days now and nothing is helping. I've also been eating every thing in sight!,I was on Lexapro for YEARS until I got pregnant in 09. I stopped the Lexapro (and Wellbutrin) until I had a severe postpartum episode. I called my psych for the first time_ at home_ and she put me right on the Wellbutrin. I stayed away from Lexapro b/c I read too much about how hard it is to get off and b/c of the brain zaps I had while withdrawing the first time while I was pregnant. I tried Zoloft and Cymbalta over the past year_ avoiding the Lexapro. After some unreal rage a few weeks ago I asked if Lexapro would be my best bet since I was on it before. My psych thought it would be a good idea. I started on 10 mg right away and up to 20 mg after 5 days. That was about 3 days ago. I cannot find any other reason for the headache I've had that I cannot find relief for. I have also been eating every thing I see for the past week. Since I was on both this and Wellbutrin (the best one for depression and anxiety in my experience_ but just not enough by itself to get rid of the severe anxiety I have) for so many years_ I can never really pinpoint a 'side effect'. I blame everything on my anxiety. This HAS to be the Lexapro. I'm going back to 10 and then off if I keep eating like this and this headache doesn't go away. I have a 17 year old_ an 18 month old and am in nursing school. I cannot afford to be out of commission for even one day right now. I'm so disappointed.,F,36,10  days20 1X D,2/5/2012Email,Lexapro

NOW I AM DEALING WITH MUCH WORSE CONDITION AND HOPEFULLY REVERSIBLE S.E.. this drug would exacerbate your condition and would give you additional distressing side effect. it is always a must to weigh the benefits & side effects before taking any psychotropic medications these kind of drugs should always be a last resort except for those suicidal_ schizophrenic & psychotic patients the first line should be on how you can deal with your condition psychologically not chemically.,M,30,3  months10 1X D,1/27/2012Email,Lexapro

I was unable to leave my bed without experiencing severe panic. I call Lexapro my great equalizer. Within a few weeks of taking it_ I was myself again_and within a few months_ I was a fully functioning human being for the first time in years. The first few weeks are rough adjusting to any antidepressant_ but if you can make it past that period of time_ you start to feel the benefits. Yes_ there are some sexual side effects_ but my husband and I have worked together to find ways to make sure I am satisfied. I really cannot say enough positive things about Lexapro.

Over the 10 years_ it has done a great job at lowering my anxiety and evening me out.  I worried less about things and was able to cope with issues and problems much better.  Overall_ I felt much better.  But after 10 years of taking it_ I feel like my brain has become dull and numb.  It has become difficult to concentrate on anything or to get motivated to do anything.  It has started to affect my job as there are days I just sit and stare at my computer and don't feel like doing anything and just can not think.  I seem to be tired and unmotivated to do anything anymore.  Even things at home that I used to find enjoyable before.

Before I started I felt severely depressed all the time to the point of feeling suicidal every day; afraid to go around people or social events_ always fearful of rejection_ now I'm a social bird and only feel slight depression during PMS_ but at a normal level. Lexapro does make me really hungry_ but NOT for sweets so that's a plus for me because in the past on other antidepressants that's all I wanted was sweets.

As for my anxiety_ I think it helped a little but the side effects I experienced out ways it taking away the anxiety (which wasn't the real problem or the MAIN reason I tried it) It also made me have terrible insomnia. I have always had trouble with my sleep but this would keep me up for days and then some days I would just sleep because I was so tired.

It's important for everyone to remember that pills don't work miracles and you really should seek therapy as well to get to the root of your problem. I have suffered from GAD for almost 7 years and recently had my first therapy session and feel like a new person. Just a little bit of education and information on how your feeling can give you a whole new perspective. I am now finally tapering off of Lexapro and will be cold turkey for the first time in 6 years. Lexapro definitely helps but you don't have to live this way forever.

I could deal with being a bit of an emotional zombie (a nice switch from extreme anxiety) but the cognitive fog was more than I was willing to sacrifice.

I have also had 2 urinary tract infections and I haven't had one in years up until now.  I really don't care too much about the UTI's but the twitching is becoming really bothersome since I am an administrative assistant and a Realtor. Basically_ I am on the computer all day long and I am twitching so I am clicking the mouse button when I don't mean to and hitting keys when I don't mean to.  It is very frustrating.

The vitamin had so many ingredients that I wasn't sure what caused the interaction_ but it was fairly dramatic.  the vitamin did not contain St. John's Wort_ so it must have been something else.  It was as if the lexapro ceased to be metabolized and built up in my system.  by the 5th day on the vitamins_ I was really quite nervous_ sweaty_ insomnia_ etc.  After about 3 days off the vitamin it seems to be fading_ but due to the long half life of this drug it may take a little while to re-establish my normal concentration.,M,47, 15MG 1X D,11/30/2011EmailHistory,Lexapro

However_ it did make me drowsy and the yawning got old.  Very realistic dreams and difficulty getting up in the morning no matter when I took the med.  Doc switched me to Pristiq to try and find complete relief_ but I had to discontinue due to anxiety SE of Pristiq.  Trying Wellbutrin generic next...,F,34,30  days10 mg 1X D,8/1/2011,Lexapro

That has gotten better_ but muscle pain has not improved much. Pain or aches pop up in random places. Even in fingers sometimes. Sleeping is terrible mostly do to the aches. Aleve works a little bit. Restless leg issues I had while on the drug have subdued but daily body aches are annoying. Jaw clenching totally gone! I will update again in a few more weeks.

I also take .5 klonipn a day.  I take both before bed and sleep good_ another trade off.

321, 3, Anxiety / Depression,- diarrhea- agitation (at first)- fatigue (for past 2.5 months)- increased appetite- weight gain - a bit apathetic  - decreased libido- difficulty achieving orgasm,This medication has helped me control my anxiety attacks but it took nearly 1.5 months for it to really kick in. I'd say this med helped lift my depression first and then my anxiety. The two side effects that have troubled me the most are the fatigue and increased appetite/weight gain.  I don't seem to have the energy to do anything anymore except eat. Even though I sleep 8 hours a night now_ I often want to nap come noon. Also_ by mid afternoon I start to crave breads or sweets like a mad woman and never really feel full after eating a large meal.

Please excuse my English. I live in Greece. I had my first panic attack in 1999. Depression and anxiety were present too. Since then I am on and off with antidepressants. Taking them few months_ then stop and continue after. But this was wrong. At least for me. I should have listen to my doctor. I have tried almost everything. I think cipralex ( is how  escitalopram is named here) is the best drug I have used.  Minor side effects. I have noticed a great improvement with sexual side effects_ since I started taking the medicine at bed time. Also_ reading philosophy and going to gym helped me a lot. Medicine helps_ but we must help ourselves. Be in peace with yourself and others. Try to enjoy yourself. You will feel much better.

327, 5, grief,First couple of weeks I had no feelings. It was a Godsend. I'd suffered through 1.5 years of contstant crying and physical pain from grief after my husband committed suicide. I was emotionally crippled.,I still have trouble experiencing grief but I'm not complaining. Sometimes I feel guilty about that. I want to cry over my husband's loss but it's much better this way. I was on the road to suicide myself. I could not take the pain anymore. This drug is a godsend to somebody for whom it works and who desperately needs a reprieve from utter despair. I feel great and can laugh_ experience a slighty limited range of emotions but the ones I don't seem to experience much I don't want. Like others_ I_ too_ have trouble crying. I do on occasion cry but not like it was before. My guts hurt so bad_ my heart ached so bad I felt I would die from it. I don't have that anymore. If you need a rest_ try this drug. The effects have lessened over time for the better. I'm actually afraid to go off of it after refusing to try it for over a year. My doctor insisted I try something to give my body and mind a break.

328, 3, Generalized Anxiety Disorder,Vivid technicolor dreams.  Clenching of the jaw.  Chronic fatique for the first two weeks_ then just mild fatigue.  The drug eliminated the panic attacks_ but the side effects were annoying.  I gained 18 lbs very quickly and craved carbs all the time.  Weaning off Lexapro took two months.  I reduced to 5 MG for six weeks and had fewer side effects.  I then reduced to 2.5 MG for four weeks and started to feel some withdrawl in the form of mild vertigo.  After stopping the drug_ I had mild vertigo for six weeks and then it disappeared completely.  If I had to go through this again_ I would ask for Paxil instead.,,M,42,14  months10 MG 1X D,5/23/2011,Lexapro
329, 5, Severe anxiety and panic attacks,No side effects,I started on Lexapro because I was experiencing panic while driving.  I would feel like I was going to pass out and lose control of the car.  I became very fearful and had to rely on others for transportation to and from work.  I was also experiencing severe anxiety and would be shaking (physically) and became dependent on Clonazepam during the day to calm down.  This went on for three months before taking Lexapro.  The results are great_ but they did take time.  I noticed a change after week 5 on the Lexapro.  I no longer need Clonazepam during the daytime and my driving abilities are now restored.  I don't have panic attacks.  I am so grateful to have a great doctor.  I am also on Nefazodone 125 mg once a day_ Lamictal 50 mg_ Geodon 40 mg_ and .5 Clonazapam at night and Zolpidem 10 mg for sleeping.  It was the addition of the Lexapro that made the difference.,F,55,6  weeks10 Mg 1X D,5/17/2011Email,Lexapro
330, 4, Insomnia and anxiety,Jaw clenching and heightened anxiety for first two weeks,After the initial two weeks_ lexapro has diminished anxiety considerably. My severe nausea has subsided and appetite is returning. My sleep has improved to where I am now sleeping 6-8hrs a night instead of 1-3 hours. During my initial two weeks I wanted to stop taking the  lexapro_ but I am glad I listened to my MD..give this med a chance. I now want to get out of bed again. It is amazing how much better it is to deal with life when severe anxiety and insomnia begin to subside. I would have rated this drug a 5 if I didn't have the jaw clenching side effect_ but that is mild compared to what I was experiencing without it,F,55,1  months10 1X D,5/15/2011,Lexapro
331, 4, mild depression,harder to ejaculate,Not sure if anyone has had this experience - but the side effect of difficulty or failure to ejaculate has a bright side. While it takes longer and more effort to get to orgasm_ once it happens it is way more intense and pleasurable. The first time I took Lexapro_ and after about a week_ it was immediately noticeable that it was harder to get to orgasm_ but once there the intensity was way beyond anything I have experienced before - 'mind blowing' is the best way to describe it. I thought maybe it was a fluke but not so_ in fact the harder it is to get to orgasm the better the intensity of the orgasm. And I have always been able to finally get to orgasm. I estimate that 90% of all my orgasm over the past 2 years of being on Lexapro where better than all of the orgasms before. I have always wondered if anyone else has had this wonderful 'side effect.',M,51,2  years20 1X D,5/10/2011Email,Lexapro

Don't feel like talking to people or going out anymore because I'm so unhappy with my fat self. Zero libido too. Will see new psych dr. in two weeks to discuss changing meds.

333, 3, anxiety/depression,Lack of motivation_ VERY TIRED all the time_ memory loss-feel scatter brained,I take citalopram which is genaric for lexapro. I started on 10mg and continued to have anxiety so the dosage was increased. I take it at night and have found that it helps me sleep. When I don't take it_ (if I miss my dose) I have difficulty sleeping. I feel so tired all the time that I don't have the energy to do basic every day household tasks. Then I feel guilty for being lazy. I have to take a nap every day. I also have difficulty remembering things and feel scatterbrained. I will think of something that I need to do and less than a minute later I have forgotten what it was that I needed to do. I have a Dr.'s appt. soon and I will share this with my doctor. I would like to try a different antidepressant because the loss of motivation and being tired all the time is making me feel lazy_ worthless_ and almost as depressed as before I started taking it.,F,28,6  months20 MG 1X D,5/6/2011,Lexapro
334, 1, mild depression,I didn't take Lexapro long enough to evaluate it for its intended purpose_ because I found the sexual side effects intolerable.  I not only lost the ability to orgasm_ but stopped having even the slightest feelings of arousal. Near the end of the two weeks I could feel my frustration as a sort of dull_ heavy ache in my stomach_ but I couldn't do anything about it because I was basically numb_ a nonsexual being. It was frankly disturbing_ and I think going off the drug and feeling healthy and whole again has done more for my depression than any medication ever has.,I've heard great things about what this drug can do for depression_ but the side effects are a real possibility.

I used to have extreme anxiety which caused me to have to use the bathroom and have a bowel movement.  My stools were so loose at times_ I would feel like I wouldn't make it to the bathroom.  I got to where I wouldn't want to go anywhere in public for fear I would have an accident.  Since I have been taking Lexapro_ my anxiety is completely gone and I feel normal again.  My life was so debilitating for me and I often thought_ oh know_ how can I hold down a job.  I feel much happier and joke with my family.  My sleeps are wonderful and I feel great when I get up in the morning.  I seem much more focused at work and seem to get much more done even.

Lexapro started working great almost right away and it did 4 about 10 months. In october 2010 I went back 2 see my doctor due migraine headaches I started having and they realized that they were also caused by all the stress I was having at work and dealing with my husband getting laid off from his work. My depression kicked back in also.. I found myself pretty  much crying again every single day and started cutting myself... That is why my doctor recommended bringing my Lexapro dosage up to 20mg and honestly I have never felt better.. No wait gain at all_ i am getting much more sleep and I can get a lot more accomplished during the day... I can definetely say that this medication has totally saved me and my marriage_ plus I can finally get some quality time with my child too_ instead of constantly thinking about whats gonna come next I'm actually living and enjoy every single moment at a time!,F,28,3  weeks20  MG 1X D,3/8/2011,Lexapro

364, 1, Depression,Toxic poison. Felt doped up in a drunken stupor. Tired_ fatigue_ weight gain_ hair loss.,Tried all the antidepressants_ thought I would give this one a shot. Increased anxiety like mad! After trying 25 antidepressants_ my doctor put me on 5 mcg's of Cytomel. After 15 years of depression_ it went away in one day with Cytomel. It was like someone turned on the life switch. My thyroid tests were and are still normal.'I don't think big pharma has depression quite figured out yet. Try Cytomel!!! Read the testimonials on here_ they are the same as mine. Start low and go slow (5 mcg's - 10 mcg's). No more than 10 mcg's per day.'You will feel like a dead plant come back to life!

365, 4, Anxiety/Panic,First night my legs were slightly achy(not bad). Second day I woke feeling very well! Second and third_ fourth_ fifth day feeling alot better but with slight stomach ache_ nothing bothersome. Sixth day_ I had one beer (Fat Tire)_ less than two hours later it felt like my skin was on fire! I became very nauseous and my hearing muffled with a nice loud ringing. I stumbled outside trying to take my cloths off. These adverse affects only lasted about ten minutes and if I hadn't already been used to panic attacks I probably would have gotten a ride to the hospital.,I dose first thing in the morning and I take Clonazepam .5mg twice a day.Today is my seventh day and I feel great. I guess my body doesn't want me to drink while on this medication. Very small trade out! I will check up with Doc to make sure every thing is fine.P.S. Sex drive has been great_ which was my primary concern with this medication.,M,28,7  days10mg 1X D,2/28/2011Email,Lexapro

I am now 10 days completely off and OMG is it rough. I have flu-like symptoms_ dizziness_ major mood swings_ lots of anxiety_ tiredness. I have no idea when this will end. I have been taking lots of vitamin supplements from truehope.com to help and it is still terrible. I just really want to be done with this. I would never have guessed withdrawal would be so terrible. I am looking to get pregnant and do not want to be on any medications. Also neurofeedback has been more helpful than the medicine ever was.,F,39,5  years20mg 1X D,2/21/2011,Lexapro

Basically bed ridden...had to quit my job_ unable to take care of my 2 year old (Grandma does)...had blood tests done twice in the passed 6 months to see if I had some other illnes that was causing the exhaustion...nothing showed up in the tests...the doctor mentioned that it could be the lexapro...after reading all of these comments..it seems that this is probably the case...I will say Lexapro helped the depression_ but this is no way of life either...I feel like I am half dead....I am going to wean myself off of this crap...I will post again and let you know if the tiredness subsides....best of luck to everyone!,,F,26,10  months10mg 1X D,2/19/2011Email,Lexapro
368, 3, depression,slept for 12 hrs a day. could have slept more but felt like I had to get up and do something. very vivid dreams. very deep sleep- I used to be a very light sleeper that woke up at the slightest thing. weight gain.,I was horribly depressed. I was crying all the time. Lexapro helped almost immediately. I was expecting to have to wait a couple of weeks. I quit overreacting to things. If it was not for the extreme amount of sleep I needed_ I would stay on this drug. Getting off it is another story. After being off it for a few days_ I start getting this buzzing sound in my head. After a week or so off it_ I went completely mental. I got upset with my son and starting throwing things around. Screaming at him. Now_ I take a half a pill every time the buzzing starts just to prevent myself from going crazy again. I need to get to the doc and see if there is something else I can take. I am not really sure how this drug got on the market.,F,48,4  months10 1X D,2/19/2011,Lexapro

I have to tell you that when I first took it_ I had the side effects I've listed_ but they WENT AWAY. I lost the weight through swimming_ my libido is as obscene as it ever was_ and I feel normal which means...well_ undepressed. I plan on taking it for a long time_ because I'm a chronic depressive.

370, 5, Depression,I have dry mouth but Lexapro is not the only med I take that can cause dry mouth.,My insurance company would not pay for Lexapro_ only Celexa.

371, 2, Depression,I have been losing handfuls of hair every time I brush_ wash or run my fingers through it. I now have to brush my hair outside by the trashcan and I only wash it twice a week. I've become more depressed about this and cry every day. I am also so fatigued that I am sleeping several times during the day_ as well as 8-9 hours at night.,One month ago at my doctor's appointment_ he said that hair loss is not a side effect and to continue the Lexapro. My research finds that many people suffer this side effect. I have stopped taking this medication.,F,58,4  months10 MG 1X D,2/8/2011,Lexapro
372, 2, Depression,Decreased sex drive_ emotions felt numb_ slept a lot.,I only took this medication for a week because I had zero interest in sex. Even at 5mg I couldn't have an orgasm. My dr. recommended staying on it longer to see if my symptoms improved_ but I didn't have the patience to wait it out. I'm now on Wellbutrin and feel much better.,F,31,7  days5 1X D,2/6/2011,Lexapro
373, 3, Depression and Anxiety,Insomnia_ vivid and disruptive dreams_ decreased libido_ anorgasmia_ decreased appetite but craving carbs so overall weight gain_ clenching jaw,I have been on and off Lexapro for years. I take a very low dose as I am extremely easily affected by prescription drugs. Have tried a variety of things_ but recently am coming to the conclusion that Lexapro is causing more problems than it's solving. Less weepy and depressed_ but still lethargic_ irritable. I feel that it's not doing enough for me to keep taking it_ but the negative side effects are significant enough to make me nervous about a dosage increase. Have just gone off of it_ and am likely moving to Wellbutrin next week_ which I've not yet had. Interested to take something besides the SSRIs.,F,31,5  years10-15 mg 1X D,2/5/2011,Lexapro

376, 1, Bi-Polar Depression,Worsening of Depression after 2 weeks,In my opinion and from my experience_ Lexapro is the worse anti-depressant there is.  I took it for 14 days.  In the beginning I started to feel somewhat better and then on day 14 I was plunged into one of the worst depressions of my life.  I hate this drug and would not recommend it to anyone from the experience I have had with it.,F,56,14  days10 1X D,1/27/2011,Lexapro
377, 5, Depression & Anxiety,More energy_ ability to concentrate has increased_ laughing out loud_ finding joy in going places_ EXCESSIVE YAWNINGOne thing that isn't so great about it is that although my concentration has increased dramatically_ it's a problem while driving. I can only focus on one thing at a time_ such as the lines on the road or the car in front of me_ where as before I was keeping a look out for every little thing that could go wrong. Decreased road rage.,I have been noticing an increasing amount of changes going on with myself. The biggest thing is the fact that I don't overreact to everything! I have been laughing out loud and joking around more_ and my husband seems to enjoy being around me now_ too. I have been looking for a job recently and would panic every time I had to follow up after an interview. It got to the point where I was ignoring phone calls because I couldn't deal with the idea of taking on the responsibility of a job. I got a call yesterday_ after only 4 days taking the medication_ from a place I interviewed at and was offered a job. I didn't ignore the call but picked it up and really enjoyed myself. Then I was bouncing off of the walls with enthusiasm! I wake up in the morning with energy and a clear head. I no longer feel like I'm dragging all day. I have been having an issue with misplacing things. I poured a cup of coffee for myself_ grabbed the sugar and creamer_ put the sugar in my coffee then placed the sugar in the fridge in place of the creamer. When I used the creamer and brought that to the fridge_ I found the sugar! I've been doing it a lot lately- I focus on the act of making coffee_ but the other actions are not controlled.,F,21,5  days10 1X D,1/18/2011Email,Lexapro
378, 4, depression,I really didn't have any side effects from lexapro at all_ For the time I took it I think it really did help. I was able to stop fixating on death_ being SO critical of myself all the time_ etc. It was definitely the push I needed to start getting out of that depression.,After a while it kinda just stopped working_ and my doctor thought it was time to try another medication. Coming off was fine for me no withdrawal symptoms.,F,18,1  years 1X D,1/9/2011,Lexapro
379, 4, mild GAD and Migraine Prevention,I started taking Lexapro a couple of weeks ago after giving Cymbalta a quick 2 week try.  I like it much better.  Side effects were a lot gentler!  I have experienced a bit of nausea_ but it seems to be getting better.  Sleeping Great!  Unlike Cymbalta.  Sex drive seems better too.  A little tired during the day_ but manageable.  Felt a little hazzy_ but think that was from the Cymbalta b/c it only lasted a few days with Lexapro.  A big disadvantage is that I love the taste of food much more so now!  I have the desire to eat all the time!,Started on 5mg for 5 days and then titrated up to 10mg.  Glad I did that b/c I am very sensitive to meds...  I think it helped. Drug seems to be helping.  I've only had one migraine!  It also is helping me not to 'sweat the small stuff' so much.,F,38,16  days10mg 1X D,1/2/2011,Lexapro

Found it very difficult to diet!Felt so good I convinced myself I was 'cured' and weaned myself off at 12 months but came crashing down again after 2 months successfully off the drug. Am taking Lexapro again_ but trying 10mg p/day as I feel I was too apathetic on 20mg.Good choice to take Lexapro. Still not perfect but cope better with situations that previously stressed me out the most (dating_ travel_ etc),F,26,1  years20MG 1X D,12/21/2010Email,Lexapro

384, 4, Lifelong depression; anxiety,First day I experienced pronounced euphoria; however_ by Day 2 this effect had disappeared. Experienced several days of mild headaches and fatigue that gradually went away. Decreased appetite. None of the side effects were dramatic or unmanageable_ and the good I've experienced so far with this drug has far outweighed the bad.,I was extremely apprehensive about taking any sort of chemistry altering prescription drug. This is the first anti-depressant I've ever tried. I've resisted the idea for years despite having multiple therapists suggest it. I've had lifelong moderate to severe depression (20+ years)_ and general anxiety for about the last two years. Mood swings_ anger_ the whole shebang. I began feeling the positive effects of Lexapro within the first week -- the fog lifted. I have more energy_ I'm much much more positive (lifelong pessimist)_ starting to set goals_ more focused_ and I doubt I could cry on command anymore like I could for years. The anxiety is noticeably reduced_ although I have experienced some situational anxiety. However_ I was able to move through it swiftly and leave the situation behind within hours unlike before when I would brood and suffer for days. I have NOT lost my personality as I was afraid I would_ in fact_ I feel more like myself. As an artist and writer_ I was concernced I would no longer feel creative or have left any wild emotion as inspiration. Turns out that fear was unfounded. Looking back_ I realize the depression suppressed my personality with its crushing worry and doubt and hopelessness. I am very happy with Lexapro so far (only been three weeks_ so I'm still cautious). ONE THING: If you are a drinker_ this is NOT for you. After half a glass of wine I feel woozy and awful. The effect of alcohol in combination with Lexapro is intensified (not to mentio,F,35,3  weeks5 mg 1X D,12/14/2010,Lexapro
385, 3, Anxinety_ depression,Diarrhea_ inability to orgasm_ loss of sexual pleasure_ significant weight gain_ withdrawal was not pleasant,I would say that the drug did remove the initial anxiety and depression I was feeling. It did not help improve my memory nor do anything for my social anxiety though. The first 6 weeks there was a lot of running to the bathroom - I don't see how someone like a truck driver could ever take this drug. As time went on_ my sexual sensitivity began to diminish_ my weight began to skyrocket (20+ lbs.) and the benefits of the drug began to be outweighed by the anxiety and depression caused by getting fat and sexual dysfunction - so I quit and decided to take a cognitive approach (listening to self-help tapes with positive messaging) and exercise. It's been a few months without and I'm OK - but withdrawal is a *bitch*. To me it feels like you are feverish and it lasted maybe 5-6 weeks. Let's not be too dramatic here - I didn't feel like it was the end of the world_ but it was no walk in the park. I did half my dose for 2 weeks before quitting_ though. Despite all this_ looking back_ it might have been what I needed for the time that I was on it.,M,48,6  months10 1X D,12/4/2010,Lexapro

I have suffered depression anxiety and panic attacks in the past. I found it very helpful. It made me feel so much better and completely stopped the anxiety and panic attacks.

389, 3, Depression and Anxiety,Anxiety_ bad bad anxiety. shaking one day_ feeling nervous_ feeling keyed up_ insomnia_ racing thoughts_ decrease in appetite,I'm just on day 10 but what a ride its been.Before I started I had a worsening of depression due to beginning birth control--also irritability and fatigue.My personal life had become so stressful and I couldn't tolerate the emotional pain. I am very sensitive to meds so just started 5mg of lexapro. I had a panic attack which I don't have a history of. Had shaking for one day. Doc advised me to try another day and the anxiety hasn't been as bad--no panic or shaking but still a lot to deal with. I am increasing also. currently on 7.5 hopefully can make it at least to 10 in a few weeks. It seems to be getting a little better daily. Big pros: I have so much energy I don't even recognize myself. But it also feels like normal amounts of energy. Its been so long since I had this kind of energy. I dont' feel like I am 90 years old anymore.Things don't feel nearly so overwhelming. I started feeling these affects on day 8. So I'm feeling definite benefits. Insomnia at first but it is slowly improving and so is my appetite. I take it first thing in the morning and have about 6 hours of anxiety. The afternoons I feel better now.,F,34,10  days5 to 10 1X D,11/19/2010Email,Lexapro
390, 5, Depression; Agorphobia,Really none.  Maybe carelessness with words; I need to watch what I say out loud VS. what I keep to myself - mostly bad humor.  But a sense humor is a good thing_ right?  I should point out that I take Lexapro before going to bed in order to avoid any other possible side effects.  There have been none other than some light headedness when I first starting taking the drug.  That went away after a few days.,I had problems with bad side effects with a few other drugs before trying Lexapro.  However_ Lexapro has been great for me.  I started with 10 MG and upped to 20 MG after a month to see if it would be even better_ and it is.  I'm more focused at work and find great satisfaction and pride in what I do.  I'm so much better with people_ especially coworkers.  I've taken a few trips to places like Boston_ Newport RI and New York city (twice) and had a great time.  Crowds don't bother me anymore.  It's like a whole new world.  I don't worry about anything; I get things done.  I've lost weight due to being more active.  Also_ my sex drive is terrific.  No problems at all in that department.  I do tend to take a bit longer to climax_ but I appreciate the extra time in the moment!  This drug has given me life.,M,40,5  months20 MG 1X D,11/16/2010,Lexapro

Very vivid dreams.,"I like Lexapro because I do not have side-effects with it. No changes to weight gain/loss (though I'd like to lsoe)_ no libido issues_ etc. I've had good luck with it although I recently increased from 10 mg to 20 mg. I was on 10 mg for 18 months and it worked great_ but then I had a major spike in depressive symptoms. My doctor increased me to 20 to get over the hump and I hope to decrease again to 10 at some point. Overall I am very happy with the drug_ feel much better_ and able to cope.

394, 1, Depression and mild anxiety,A few hours afer taking my first lexapro_ I had to calm myself down from a panic situation.  I haven't had an anxiety attack in months_ so i'm gonna assume that the drug caused it.  Other side effects i've experienced:  eye dilation_ nervousness_ dry mouth_ and a weird feeling in my face.  Kind of a chemical taste in my mucous membrane areas.  I feel quite a bit worse that I did two days ago.,I know that this drug is supposed to take awhile to work_ but after two days_ that'll be it for me.  I called my dr. on day 1 and asked him if these effects were normal.  He assured me that the way I felt was me_ and not a side effect of the drug.  I didn't believe him.

I ended up taking it during the summer_ feeling better_ and stopping it for the school year and then getting worse just in time for summer again.  I think if I had stayed on it consistently it would have been much better.  I did have to increase my dose from 10mg to 20mg when my symptoms became worse due to a life-stressor_ and though it definitely helped_ it still wasn't enough for my huge increase in anxiety.

I am not depressed_ but_ I have the same feelings as others have stated_ ""Non careing"" ""No interest"" etc. But  I also had those feelings when i had been depressed.  So it seems to have lifted the depression but has not fixed other feelings that I would like to have back_ that I use to have a long time ago.",I tried to come off the Lexapro after many years in order to get back my careing feelings and get spark back into my life.  Unfortunety I began having nightmares.(daytime seemed OK) but those nightmares scared the hell out of me.  I had to go back on to the Lexapro.  My depression began after 9/11 and also due to a seizure disorder that began in 1993 that I've been taking Phenobarbatal and Neurontin for since 93.  Only began the Lex in 2002.  I have had no seizures due to the pheno and the neurontin_ which (the Neurontin) for me was a miracle drug.  The Lexapro was added due to the depression.

The best I can explain it is if there is such a place as hell then I know what it feels like. The effect was so profoundly disturbing I wanted immediate relief from it and due to the drugs rapid and dramatic effect I was unable to think clearly_ I was not in control of my actions_ the only solution I could see was to jump off the balcony. It literally drove me mad and to suicide. Had I not had urgent intervention within 1/2 an hour of taking Lexapro I would have been dead.

Anxiety_ loss of appetite_ constant ""full"" feeling_ feeling like there was a lump in my throat_ some trouble sleeping_ some trouble reaching orgasm.",I started on Lexapro for a sudden flare up of anxiety and depression. After being on it for three months_ I am finding that I may have been having the anxiety and depression for longer than I thought.  I feel better than I have in years.  I can focus more_ I am more active_ and I look forward to social settings that I was starting to view as unwanted before the medication. The adjustment period for this drug was tough_ but ultimately I am very satisfied with the results now that my body has adapted to the medication. If you are in the first six weeks_ really try to ride it out as the bad days during this period were really bad.  The anxiety during the adjustment period was constant but minimal.  The loss of appetite and 'full' feeling were the worst - including feeling like I had a permanent lump in my throat_ just below the adams apple. There was some trouble sleeping early on_ but this passed within a few days.  Dreams are more vivid (and continue to be) and feel more real than in the past - although they tend to be dreams of just everyday occurrences - nothing freaky. An example is dreaming that I took the garbage out_ and later in the day having to go check the trash to see if I really did take it out_ because the dream memory felt like a real memory_ and I remembered every detail.  I did have some trouble reaching orgasm_ but ultimately got there with a little more work than usual.

Slept a lot- 10 hrs-12hrs/day some days. Got to be a big problem after 6yrs.My psychiatrist told me I was depressed_ I told her it was because I slept all day. She increased my Lexapro to 40mg. I slept 18-20hrs/day and was depressed for doing so. Now on Nuvigil plus a low dose of adderall for med-induced ADD_ I still can't get myself to do anything. My place is a mess and I care but don't. The only emotion I feel is frustration over the lack of emotion and interest in my art. I will start to go off Lexapro in a week and a half by 5mg increments weekly.

Later I became angry_ paranoid at times_ and foggy headed. I gained weight that I couldnt lose.Another doctor suggested I get of SSRI's due to the sex problem. He suggested Welbutrin_ although I tried Nefazodone first because of anxiety concerns with Welbutrin.It took three months to get off Lexapro_ but once off it I couldn't believe how much better I started feeling. The depression vanished_ my anxiety has all but disappeared_ and my sex drive has started making a comeback (pun intended). I lost 20 pounds easily.

My Dr told me to start taking it at night so I did so. It definitely helped me go to sleep at night. Before I took the pill_ I would stay up all night with racing thoughts and paranoia that someone was going to break into my house. Lexapro definitely helped with the paranoia and random panic attacks. Lexapro is a wonderful anti-depressant and anxiety medication but I felt as if I was a walking zombie most of the time. The BIGGEST and WORST side effect was that I COMPLETELY lost my sex drive. It would take me FOREVER to achieve orgasm and when I would_ I wouldn't even feel it! I decided it was at that time that I needed to switch medications. My Dr said every anti-depressant works differently for each individual and I believe that is true.

You still have the thoughts_ theyre just not as big a deal. Remember_ there are millions of people taking this drug. You can't base your impression of it on 500 people who had side effects that troubled them. Do what I did. Start with a very low dose_ see how you feel and take it from there. What do you have to lose? Half a day worth of nausea worst case scenario?

Back to normal ...then about 3 months ago I tried to come off it again_ same thing..This past week_ I tried to get off it again_ bad idea while traveling.

I experienced a specific situational anxiety moment and instead of going to cognitive therapy_ I requested an anti anxiety medication from my dr. BIG MISTAKE. I went through 3 medications in 5 weeks_ each causing increased anxiety_ with Lexapro being the worse poison. I started therapy 5 weeks ago and have been Lexapro free for 4 days and guess what_ I have 90 percent less anxiety and realize that it's my negative thinking that creates anxiety_ and not a serotonin deficiency.

Situations that use to cause me ""panic"" or ""anxiety"" do so rarely and with pronounced reduction in symptoms.  I think the lexapro effectively prevents the depression chemistry from having a strong affect.  It's the same for ""panic"" and ""anxiety"".  It surely reduces the adverse chemistry production.  I have spent years re-training my brain and educating myself on how to deal with panic and anxiety. Many years ago I was helpless and lived in terror.  Those days are gone.  I've used many meds to treat anxiety.  I think lexapro is excellent for both depression and anxiety.  I think the best medication for people just starting to deal with the nightmare of ""panic"" is clonazepam to get them out of the terror mode rapidly during a severe attack.

But the great thing is the downs were not as low and the ups were more consistent!  I really am feeling better_ but not in the clear yet.  But it is clearly helping me compartmentalize stressors so I can see them as less threatening.   This is markedly improving for me.   I also take Remeron and for me_ the combination is steadily providing me energy_ a more positive outlook_ and am noticing and enjoying people more with patience and compassion.   I like it so far_ just wish it had worked faster and been prescribed sooner.  Clearly we are all different...find what works for YOU_ and manage your doctors!

I still get head aches occasionally and feel nauseaus quite a bit which has seen my weight plummet to 109 pounds (i'm 5'3). In my opinion this drug is great for depression. I feel generally happier and actually find it difficult to feel upset unless it's something significant. It's a good mood stabilizer. But as for anxiety and panic disorder i'm still unsure whether it is helping me or not. I still have panic attacks although not nearly as many as I was experiencing before taking lexapro. I have symptoms of anxiety on a regular basis. I think what has helped me most is accepting my anxiety and learning ways to manage and deal with it through therapy. I would not rely on this to put an end to anxiety. Therapy and a benzodiazapine are what you need for that. I will probably try and come off lexapro soon.,F,21,9  months30 1X D,8/30/2010,Lexapro

446, 5, GAD/Depression,Initially_ I experienced increased anxiety_ it lasted a few days and was totally worth it!,Firstly_Id like to say Ive seen an inc in positive comments for Lex on this site since I was here last.People generally dont go on forums to speak about pos exp -we like to vent when we've had a neg exp_its human nature_ so please bear that in mind. I began taking lex 1yr ago for GAD.For some reason I never admitted to my doc how depressed I had been.I began on 5mgs-which is a good dose to start on with GAD as the adjustment phase can be a bit rocky.On hearing about the adj phase a few years back I declined anti-ds because I wondered why I would want to inc the symptoms I was trying to get rid of.As I said_it was only for a few days.After 2 weeks I increased to 10mgs as I really wasn't feeling the benifits on 5mgs.Well_I have never looked back!Iam so much happier and able to manage life.I wont say I'm cured_I still have my wobbles but the Lex is the support which helps me to deal.Some people have told me they feel under a cloud or spaced out on Lex-I have never felt clearer or more in control.I'm happy and calm-I love it.Negatives would be-my libido has suffered a bit but I can live with that and I have gained about a stone.I thought initially the w8 gain was due to my pos mood-being hungry an not having my guts in a twist the whole time.All I can say is..if youre unhappy_cant deal with life_are too afriad to go outside_give this a go_youre already at rock bottom and the only way is up.Chin up_youll find yourself again.Good luck.,F,29,1  years10 mg 1X D,8/18/2010Email,Lexapro
447, 2, Depression and Anxiety,More irratible. Total loss of sex drive. Loss of appetite. Burning sensations. Increased anxiety.,Doc started me on 10 mg of Lexapro for depression and anxiety. To be fair_ some people say that it works wonders for them_ but it was a real nightmare for me. Almost immediate loss of sex drive. Within 15 minutes of taking one the nausea set in and never let up. It made me foggy and emotionally distant. Seemed to make my OCD worse. Could not get horrible thoughts out of my head. Increased sweating and hot flashes were unbearable. Intense burning in the soles of my feet. Total loss of appetite to the point where everthing I ate just seemed to get bigger the more I chewed it. Lost 10 lbs quickly. By the evening of day 5 I was almost in full blown panic attack. I went back to the doc and he switched me to Prozac and Klonopin. After I took one dose of Prozac I noticed right away that there was no nausea. Soon after I ate a cheeseburger and had no problems tasting it or swallowing it. Loved every bite. Ate breakfast this morning just fine. Hot flashes and feet burning have dissapated and are almost gone. All summed up Lexapro was horrible for me. To soon to tell about Prozac after only one dose_ but the Klonopin worked well immediately for GAD. Already feel calmer and better. Placebo? Maybe. Who cares. I'll take a placebo that works over Lexapro anyday. Hope Prozac is the stuff for me.,M,42,5  days10 1X D,8/18/2010,Lexapro

I started to having loud ringing in both my ears_ (felt like I was going deaf) my vision was darkening and getting blurry.  The worst anxiety attack I've ever had!!!  I was told by my doctor that it was most likely not caused by the Lexapro.  I was also taking Bystolic for 5 days before I started Lexapro and was told to only take it when my heart rate increased.  Well_ since my ""attack""  I haven't been able to sleep.  I am very well aware of my heart beat which is very irritating.  I feel like my head is going to explode when I lay down_ my hands and feet sweat_ lightheaded_ and I worry constantly about everything that is happening to me.

I just took my first Lexapro at about 7:00 pm_ at 11:30 while watching TV I had this rushing heat sensation up my torso and up through my scalp. My heart started beating so fast that I swear I was going to literally pass out. After a hot shower and breathing deeply_ the worst has passed but I can't lay down_ because I can hear my heartbeat. It's 2 am_ I'm exhausted but am not able to sleep. This is almost like a cruel joke! I think I will stick to Zoloft_ which was great at taking the edge off! If 10mg did this to me I cant imagine if I had taken a higer dose! If you react strongly to meds DO NOT TAKE this drug! I will not be continuing it!,Too strong! Makes me feel like I'm on drugs!

454, 4, Reactive Depression and GAD,I have only been on it since yesterday ....one very weird dream....and perhaps not as full of energy,I react badly to situations. In last 20 years I have had 4 bouts of depression caused by financial problems_ GFC etc. Usually once the problem resolves itself_ the depression lifts. The current problem has been running two years and I have become heavily depressed with bouts of anxiety (when things get worse_ or an event happens where I lose control of the problem); My life became unbearable_ I had trouble getting out of bed in the morning_ could not do the things I used to love..became a pain to whole family. I wanted to avoid medication and after spending hours reading forums such as this and about side effects_ withdrawl etc_ started with 5 mg Lexapro yesterday. This sounds very strange but I felt better almost immediately. It is no placebo effect. Feels a bit like taking valium or atavan_ the heavy sighing feeling has gone and the anxiety is gone....will re-visit this forum in a week or so just in case this is really too good to be true.,M,56,2  days5 mg 1X D,7/29/2010,Lexapro

Two years later I still don't feel like I'm back 100%_ as if there is some permanent change.  I'm closer to enjoying life but I feel like my imagination and zest for life have been crippled to a certain degree.

The MAJOR side effect for me was blacking out after cosuming one alcoholic drink and vomiting the entire next day.

I was sad and not sure what life would deal me when they were gone.  Lexapro_ in the beginning_ gave me a lift in life.  I suffered the side effects of the drug believing I was feeling better.  I am here after six years of the drug and have realized_ it altered me with the effects and side effects that were not really good.  A psychologist and a therapist would tell me that I was good but the effects on my family life were devastating.  I know weaning from the drug is horrible.  It will send your brain into jolts and even after a month of weaning_ the jolts are minimal but still present. I have come to believe that this drug is something that ""everyone"" takes but have no idea how it effects your life because you are in a drug induced blunder that makes you think life is good.

Much improved anxiety control. Much better sleep. If it were not for the sexual side effects_ which end up with me not even wanting to be hugged or kissed either_ I would stay on this drug FOREVER. However_ I'm trying out Pristiq to see if I can achieve something with OK effects without total sexual dysfunction. Have tried tons of others with disastrous consequences. If Pristiq doesn't work well_ I will head straight back to lexapro and my husband and I will just keep on working on ways to have a relationship that don't revolve around me being responsive.

These went within a week and don't come back if I miss a dose.,"I feel like a new person - I can relate to people without it feeling like a huge effort now.  My sex drive is down but not gone and I can still orgasm with effort and it seems to be as good if not slightly better than before.  It's resolved some social phobia that I wasn't even aware of until I started taking Lexapro and it went away - I've ""come out of my shell"" and am having much more fun.  However after 10 mths I'm now getting sick of exercising 6 days a week and dieting_ just to keep on top of the weight gain and barely managing to do so.

Now that I've been on the medicine for a few months_ the side effects are more minor:  fatigue throughout the day_ slightly more hair loss than normal_ and a lower sex drive.,Throughout my life_ I've been a perfectionist with a severe fear of failure.  I constantly believed ppl were judging me and would over-analyze most situations.  This anxiety started hindering my daily life_ so I mustered up the courage to speak to a doctor.  After being on Lexapro_ I'm back to confident_ social self.  I still experience anxiety in certain social situations_ but I'm now more self conscious about a red_ blotchy rash I get on my neck and chest than how people are judging me.  Lexapro has given my the courage to 'make fun' of this weird rash I get and charge through these situations that make me anxious and want to hide from the situation.  I feel more at ease and comfortable with myself.  However_ I wish I could figure something to combat this rash!

It's like I'm sitting back and watching everyone else have fun_ but I can't seem to comprehend it or find joy in anything.

Feeling headaches_ nausea_ foggy_ weird feelings_ etc.  Hopefully will go away.,I was diagnosed with anxiety/panic disorder at a young age from a difficult childhood (physical and mental abuse from alcoholic father).  Started taking Zoloft in high school which helped tremendously.  I was teetering between 50 mg - 100 mg in high school and initially went up to 200 mg because the anxiety was worse.  Basically I was suppressing my emotions and past to get through high school and college which I excelled at.  I graduated from college in 2005 and about a year later (150 mg Zoloft) I started to get my anxiety and restlessness back.  Akathisia kicked in about two years ago and I finally decided after 8 - 9 years on Zoloft that it was time to give something else a try.  I still had panic attacks on Zoloft and the inner restlessness was getting terrible.I did the whole weaning off process which was terrible.  Took me about 2 months to wean off and start up Lexapro.  Most of my anxiety is health anxiety so taking any kind of medication sends me into a fit.  So I started Lexapro at 5 mg and moved to 10 mg once the side effects started to give.  Here I am about 8 months on 10 mg of Lexapro and about a week ago I started to feel 'grey' again.  So I decided to up my dosage.  I'm moving slowly to 12.5 mg and hopefully to 15 mg and to 20 mg if needed.  I am very sensitive to antidepressant meds so I have to go really slow in order to get past the side effects.

The first day off lexapro my sexual functioning was back to normal. Another thing about lexapro is that I never felt depressed like I used to_ even if I tested myself by thinking negatively_ my mind kind of wouldn't ""take the bait"" and run with it which was awesome.

Had I been left alone_ I might have attempted suicide. Though my original depression might have been what caused the racing heart rate and heavy breathing I do believe the medicine had something to do with it because I had an auditory hallucination and felt really good in the beginning.,This medication didn't work for me.

I would try one for a few weeks and get off of it just as quick.  My pdoc recommended ativan scheduled 3 times daily for the first 2 weeks to take the edge off_ and it got me through the rough patch to get used to the medication.

Would not recommend quitting cold turkey.,I've tried quite a few antidepressants and this one seems to be the one that handles my depression and I can live with the side effects.  I have been on this in the past and gone off of it several times_ but I have come to realize that this particular medicine significantly improves my life quality.

I felt like I was going to explode_ if I wasn't having a pity party I was telling people off. He then took me off welbutrin and put back on Lexapro and now I have a backache and stiff neck.

At 10mg I could fall asleep at the drop of a hat_ anyone's hat.  But it also gave me the munchies big time.  A multiple marathon runner and triathlete_ I still packed on a nearly irreversible 20 lbs in no time.  It also zapped me of energy.  I stopped swimming and had less desire to run.  I cut it back to 7.5 & then 5 mg.  At 5mg the munchies are mostly gone_ I have energy to swim again and I feel like I will be able to lose some of the weight eventually.  The libido decrease is there at any level but I seriously question whether it has anything to do w/the meds.  If you're experiencing depression_ that alone kills your libido.  I have no problem living with the reduced sex drive.  It's noticeable but insignificant compared to the greatly lessened depression Lexapro has brought me.,M,35,5  months,1/11/2010,Lexapro

Life had literally gotten unbearable_ so about two years ago_ I decided to try counseling once again coupled with medication. I found a terrific counselor who prescribed me lexapro after informing her of my previous experiences with prozac and valium.  I am now able to live a normal life.  I had to give it time to work and find the correct dosage for it to be effective.

I just can't stop eating_ and feel awful when I get hungry (nauseous etc.) Lexapro also triggers hypomania in me_ and gives me way too much energy if I take over 5mg.

Sometimes I feel zombie-like_ like life is out of focus. I have vivid dreams_ but I always had them & I enjoy them. The draw back is sometimes my life is so dream-like_ while my dreams are so life-like_ that I constantly confuse what I dreamed & what I lived. Sometimes I sleep so deep_ that I can't even wake up to use the bathroom. I would lie there a little awake (mostly asleep)_ with my bladder nagging me to get up_ but I wouldn't be able to for hours. When I do get up - I'm so drowsy_ I walk as if had 5 bottles of vodka.

Reduced libido and inability to orgasm.  Significant and lasting weight gain.,Taking this drug was a nightmare on top of my difficult situation!  If I weren't depressed before Lexapro_ the side effects sure insured that I was. And_ it did not noticably improve my depression! The worst side effect is the weight gain. I gained 22 lbs. in four months on Lexapro without any changes in diet or exercise.  It has now been months since I stopped the drug and I have only lost 4 lbs._ despite increasing my exercise and decreasing my caloric intake.  Some research shows long-term damage to the metabolism_ and my experience reflects that.  I will not ever touch this drug again!,F,32,180  days,11/11/2009,Lexapro
591, 4, Depression/Anxiety,The first week the whole world was pretty much spinning_ but that went away. There's a definite decrease in sex drive_ as well as other sexual side effects such as decreased lubrication which is annoying_ but oh well.,Works well. No panic attacks_ and allows me to be less emotional without being a drone. Being back to normal is great.,F,20,1  years,11/10/2009,Lexapro
592, 1, Anxiety/IBS,Terrible insomnia_ night sweats_ nightmares_ yawning_ watery eyes_ dilated pupils_ muscle tightness_ thirst_ always hungry_ groggy_ dizzy_ dysphoria,My doctor suggested I take 10 MG of lexapro for my anxiety [which has an effect on IBS]. I DO NOT recommend this medicine for anyone- the side effects are not worth it. It was suggested that I take lexapro in the evening before bed_ since it makes you sleepy. From day one_ I was not able to sleep_ yet I had the urge to. My body began to ache from the lack of sleep. Yesterday was day 4 - I purposely didn't take the pill and I slept through the night. I felt much better_ but decided to see how I'd react if I took lexapro in the morning. That was a bad idea; Within half an hour_ I was yawning uncontrollably and fell asleep. I am NEVER going to take lexapro again. I am sure I can find a way to deal with my anxiety without drugs.,F,22,5  days,11/10/2009,Lexapro
593, 4, Depression,Dilated pupils_ sleepiness_ dizziness first few days_ inability to cry_ anxiety.,Overall lexapro worked really well for me. I started on the 10mg and upped that after two months of little change to the 20mg. Within two weeks i felt much better. As far as mood goes_ i didnt feel any real highs or lows_ more of a constant comfortable feeling. At times I felt very anxious for no reason and at different times in the day but these negative side effects paled next to the depression i was stuck in before lexapro.,F,21,1  years,11/9/2009,Lexapro
594, 5, brain tumor / aneurysm survivor,Slight drowsiness_ cured by coffee ingestion. Zero problem with libido_ but there is an inability to ejaculate despite raging erections.  Just stay hard for hours upon hours_ but as I've always been that way_ there's basically no change... I just rarely ejaculate. very rarely_ but when I finally do_ it's copious_ 'Sexapro'... indeed.,I Thank God for this drug. I'm hypopituitary and secondary parahypothyroid_ due to an aneurysm. Needless to say_ without a pituitary and thyroid_ and after 2 neurosurgeries_ depression was something to combat. Lexapro did it excellently for me and brought me 100% back to normal. SSRI's are the best_ IMHO. feel free to e-mail for further info. This is a med I heartily recommend Lex to anyone who is either hypopituitary or hypothyroid and / or on cortef (hydrocortisone) which is essentially a depressent. Hope this helps someone in the same way I was helped.,M,57,4  years,11/8/2009Email,Lexapro
595, 5, Depression,15 pound weight gain over 1 year...jaw clenching at night...yawning during day...deeper and easier sleep with  vivid and pleasant dreams,"Lexapro is all about regaining comfort and satisfaction with your life. I come from a long line of cigarette-smoking alcoholics (I rarely drink...but did smoke). I think the alcohol and cigs were my relatives way of dealing with the depression ""gene"" we all inherited. I have been on several antidepressants_ but Lexapro is the only one that has given me back a feeling of calm satisfaction instead of the anxious dread I used to feel. I am really still ME...just a happier_ more relaxed_ if somewhat plumper me. Maybe there are many different brain-chemistry reasons for depression_ and if so_ I KNOW Lexapro works for the one that causes people to become alcoholics and die-hard cigarette smokers. Lexapro maybe be a lifetime fix for my genetic ""gift"" of depression.",F,43,2  years,11/8/2009,Lexapro
596, 4, Anxiety,Biggest and ultimately intolerable side effects were sexual- inability to achieve orgasm and overall decrease in sex drive.  Also alot of yawning.,Lexapro worked well and quickly (within a week) to help allieviate my anxiety.

I was on this for two years and gained some weight in my gut_ so I weaned myself off (which despite what you read_ if you do it very slowly_ is not that bad and totally do-able)_ but after two months was a mess again so went back on.,,F,38,2.5  months,11/3/2009,Lexapro

I am also on Sotalol for my heart and this may also cause tiredness. Anxiety so far seems slightly less but being patient and hopefully will get greater effect in another few weeks. Also will hope for no other side effects. Medicines in general dont bother me.,M,39,8  days,10/23/2009Email,Lexapro

Started tapering 14 months ago-doing it slow. There are still some withdrawal effects but nothing serious. It seems to take 3-4 wks for body to adjust to new dosage. sexual side effects still there-maybe a little better at lower dosage. If i had to do over again I would still take it. No more panic attacks.,M,39, ,10/22/2009,Lexapro
601, 5, Bipolar depression,I had minimal side effects starting it_ and none to speak of now. It seems to be a very easy drug side effect wise.,Out of the antidepressants I've tried_ the lexapro was the best at stopping the depression_ while still leaving my personality mostly untouched. I can't take more than 7.5mg without getting very manic....but the lexapro combined with 10mg zyprexa makes a VERY nice 1 2 punch ;) Overall its worked very well for me :),M,46,3  years,10/21/2009,Lexapro
602, 4, GAD,Yawning and low sex drive.,"I have now been on Lex for 2 months.  Overall it has been very helpful for GAD.  I don't constantly fret over terrible things that COULD happen.  In fact_ for the most part those thoughts kind of melt away as soon as they start.  I also experience what I call the ""lexaflow"" - occasional feelings of well being that kind of wash over me.  I'm not sure why that happens but I like it!  Lexapro has been great for taking the anxiety edge off.  Additionally_ it's made me a little more assertive.  I'm less prone to worrying about how others will react when I speak my mind.  On the icky side_ it has NO effect on PMS.  I was hoping it would ease my PMS symptoms!  In fact_ when my PMS kicks in I feel as if the Lex is not working at all.  Also_ I have an almost complete and total lack of sex drive.  Not good for my hubby.  But_ the overall relief from intense and constant anxiety is really worth it for me.",F,39,2  months,10/19/2009,Lexapro

Possibly getting laryngitis as I sound like I'm losing my voice or hoarse. First noticed hoarse voice on the third day of taking it.,Aside from the side affects_ it really has helped with anxiety and depression.

(I am glad my husband was not there)  Some weight gain even though I had more energy and was working out more. Postive: Depression was lessoned but I can not handle the teeth grinding or night guard.  My now teeth hurt all day everyday.  I am slowly trying to ween myself off.,The symptoms are not worth it for a low grade clinical depression.  I would only recommend it for suicidal type depression.,F,39,3  months,10/12/2009,Lexapro

I was alone this past Saturday night and had about 3 to 4 glasses of wine while watching a movie. I had a what I call a mental breakdown. I felt compelled to bang my head on the wall continuosly. This sounds kind of funny but it did happen. I called my GF in a panic but_ she managed to calm me down she was close to calling 911.

I am also VERY sensitive to drugs and any side effects_ I always have to start off on very low dosages. I had a very bad experience with Celexa so my Dr suggested Lexapro as it's better tolerated. I started off with 10mg which was ok but now that I'm on 20 I feel SO much BETTER. Yes_ the first few weeks weren't easy. Honestly_ reading any negative reviews on a medication won't help you either...been there_ done that and it only makes you more aware of any bad reactions. I have to say so far_ so good_ well GREAT. It's 3 weeks going on 4 of the 20mg dosage and I actually feel ""semi-normal"" if that makes any sense. I feel hopeful and positive on a more daily basis. My depression is at an all-time low and my anxiety getting better...I have relied on Xanax to calm my panic attacks and now slowly weaning off of it due to the Lexapro!

Anxiety was gone. By the 2nd week I noticed my libido was low and it took 30 minutes to orgasm. Was having to lay down every afternoon due to fatigue and would take 2 hour naps. One month after taking Lexapro I was sleeping 10+ hours at night. I was never happy or sad. Just here. I was forgetful of things I would say_ repeating things within an hour of saying it the 1st time. I had difficulty recalling what I watched on TV from day to day. I could no longer orgasm and I was craving sugar and carbs CONSTANTLY! I was gaining weight_ but cravings were so intense I didn't care. I gained 6 pounds in 6 weeks. Saw my Dr. 5 days ago and told him my symptoms. He apologized and told me to start tapering off. He reduced my dose to 5mg a day for a month and then stop. I took 5mg the day after I saw my Dr. and stopped cold turkey. It's been 4 days since I quit and my energy is returning. A little dizzy and a few sweating episodes_ but nothing I can't deal with. My mind is fuzzy but felt like that the whole time I was on Lexapro. Cravings are still here but now that my energy is returning I can resume working out. I ran a half-marathon the 1st week I took Lexapro and had been working out consistently for years. Ran 3 times in the past 6 weeks and no weight training. Lexapro messed up my ability to enjoy my 2 greatest joys in life: sex and running! No anxiety_ but if I do I will take a Buspar.

617, 5, Anxiety,When I first started taking it I had some side effects -- mild headache_ getting drunk off one beer. The side effects went away after a while. I recommend starting SLOWLY. I took a 2.5mg a day at first_ then gradually worked up to 10mg. ... Also_ a couple times I accidentally took TWO pills because I didn't remember if I took the first one or not. When this happens I get a raging headache_ like a migraine. Now_ if I'm not sure if I took it_ I let it go. Better to take none than two_ for sure.,I read conflicting information about SSRIs and headaches. Some say Lexapro is given to migraine patients_ but the package insert says headaches are a known side effect. Weird. Also_ when you have a migraine_ seratonin levels drop_ so does it make sense to have a seratonin reuptake inhibitor to prevent further absorption of seratonin? It seems counter-intuitive. Not sure if I should skip Lexapro when I have a migraine or to keep taking it. Generally_ Lexapro has been a life-saver. I started out taking Celexa and gained 20 pounds on it. I switched to Lexapro and didn't gain any more_ but neither have I lost what I gained on Celexa. :(  Lexapro helps keep my ruminating thoughts under control. I don't obsess about things as much any more_ but I still feel like myself. My thoughts have not changed_ but I don't dwell on them as much any more. I can live a normal life now without staying up all night stuck on the same thought pattern.

It kind of feels like a buffer zone between the world and me.  One nice effect: I kind of get a warm/fuzzy tickly feeling (hard to describe) which is really calming.  I'm better at socializing and coping with work stress.  I still get freaked out about the things I hear about on the news_ though.  It is helping_ but not in a major way.

I gained at least 10 pounds since I started taking it. I look back at pictures from when I was taking it and my face was very chubby from it.  One of the worst things was that I couldn't orgasm.  It felt impossible_ even if I felt like I was going to_ it just wouldn't happen_ which was very frustrating.  After stopping the Lexapro I also noticed the fact that it had made me feel a little bit like a drone_ prob. not noticeable to others_ but I felt a little zombie-ish.

678, 4, depression and anxiety,nausea_ loss of appetite_ trouble sleeping,I initially took Lexapro at 10mg with my Wellbutrin in order to stop a debilitating depressive episode from progressing. The side effects got better after 2 months. Then I got lazy and wasn't consistent about taking it and whenever I tried to take it again I'd deal with horrible nausea_ so I weaned off. After about 4 months of being off_ I noticed my irritability and anxiety increasing_ so my new doc suggested a measly 2.5 mg dosage. I'm dealing with mild nausea but feel the calming affects. I need to hang in there. BUT I think we all need to remember why we turned to anti-depressants in the first place - because we were severely depressed or ridden with debilitating anxiety that affected us living a good quality of life. If life was better off the meds than perhaps you didn't need them as bad as others do. When my side effects are difficult to deal with_ I remember that a debilitating major depressive episode_ wanting to curl up and die_ is FAR worse and I am thankful that I have options to help me live a normal life.,M,39,1.5  years,6/19/2009,Lexapro

Finally after trying most other things_ I was prescribed Lexapro a couple of years ago and I have not had to go back on the Xanax which is astounding. I have now been almost 2 weeks off the Lexapro - it made me very lazy - just wanted to lie around all day and also made me completely unconcerned regarding my appearance in public. ( a bit too unconcerned!) As it has been a full 10 years since I have spent any significant time on no medication at all_ I would like to have some clarity again_ and time to restore my memory if possible.

689, 3, GAD,The dealbreaker: sexual side effects. Within just two doses I lost the ability to have an orgasm and after a week of taking the drug my sex drive went down to almost zero. It took nearly a month to have an orgasm after the last dose I took when I quit taking it (I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD EVER COME BACK). I ended up taking Buspar and that was the wonder drug for me. Lexapro did NOT make me feel high_ manic_ or grandious. I just felt like I was at peace with my self and the world and nothing bothered me (DAMN that sexual side effect). I did get those brain zaps when I quit taking it (kinda cool and freakie).,"I REALLY liked this stuff: it helped me_ made me feel better than anything. But it took orgasm completely away_ and what was worse_ I really did not care. It bothered me that it did NOT bother me and the frustrating loss of being able to have an orgasm eventually ended this drug trial. Funny story: it made me feel so great_ I felt like announcing to everyone at a crowded lunchroom of over 250 at work that ""I feel fantastic_ and even though I cannot have orgasms anymore_ nothing can stop me!"".

690, 5, Depression,More side effects in the beginning then later--you have to give yourself time to adjust and then you will be fine. Don't take this for the first time on a work day! You need to start on the weekend. It might knock you out for a day_ but after your body will get used to it_ so hold on--it will be worth it!,Lexapro was the first drug I took for depression. The first week I took it_ I felt a smile come across my face at work and knew I was getting better. It made me feel back to my old self again_ not extra happy_ just back to my old self which was great. I took this medication in increasing dosages as I went along. After about 2 years_ my dr. added Wellbutrin to the mix and it worked out very well. After about 3 years_ my dr. switched me on to Cymbalta and kept the Wellbutrin. Cymbalta did not work well for me. It gave me strange dreams and made me have to get up to go to the bathroom several times a night (not normal for me) and did not help with my depression So I switched back to the Lexapro (kept the Wellbutrin). I take the Wellbutrin in the am and the Lexapro in the pm along with another Wellbutrin in the pm. After 6 years in total of taking Lexapro_ I feel I need to switch to something else because it's not enough any more. Going thru a difficult time at work with the bad economy and have gained about 5 pounds (not because of drug_ but because of added stress from work). Went to my dr. to get something else and have been prescribed Effexor_ which I will start as soon as I am weaned off the Lexapro. You must pay attention to what your dr. says and start slowly and end slowly if you are just starting a medication. Overall_ this drug worked very well for me and I recommend it highly.,F,39,6  years,5/25/2009,Lexapro

692, 1, Because I'm brainwashed into this,"I'm not trying to judge anyone here_ BUT...I think that our over-medicated society is fostering this obscene behavior of pill popping spineless consumer driven misery. I had a boyfriend that came from a very wealthy family. Had the best education_ car_ travel_ homes_etc. Everything was taken care of. He took this crap. He had nothing to be anxious about.

I think it would be good in combination with a stimulant of some kind.,I like not feeling depressed_ but I feel like I am being made to feel happy against my will. It's like a false sense of peace.

700, 4, Anxiety,Insomnia_ muted emotions_ decreased libido,"I took Lexapro for just over a year. I was new to panic attacks until the year before I began Lexapro (10mg). It did an EXCELLENT job at addressing my anxiety. Side effects have been:1) insomnia -- I cannot go to sleep ""naturally"" while on Lexapro; insomnia had never been a problem for me before Lexapro; now I HAVE to take Ambien CR to fall to sleep...and I always feel I have not had enough sleep.2.) Muted emotions -- I have not cried a drop or even produced a tear in over a year; sometimes wonder if I care about anything anymore. It is a strange state to be in.3.) Decreased libido -- is it my getting older or just the drug?I have been weaning myself off Lexapro. I went to 5mg for 3 weeks and then to zero. It has been one week since I have been off Lexapro. Withdrawal symptoms have been some dizziness (just from turning my head quickly at times) and some head ""noise"" (sitting hear now I can sense this ""buzzing"" in my head).

But Lexapro changed my mind. This drug is very good for me. My anxiety disappeared within two weeks. I felt sunny and happy for the first time in years. Though many others gained weight on Lexapro_ I was a compulsive overeater and was able to actually lose weight due to my diminished anxiety and increased energy_ which enabled me to hit the gym and hiking trails. I was able to function well_ and many of my anxiety symptoms (tremors_ slurred speech_ fuzzy thinking_ muscle pains etc) simply disappeared. Before taking this medication_ I was sure I had MS or ALS or something like that. My doctor assured me anxiety was causing my symptoms_ and Lexapro has more or less proved him right. The only problem is the pins and needles in my legs and the postural/orthostatic hypotension_ which is severe enough to make me stop taking the drug if it doesn't stop.,F,40,6  weeks,5/6/2009,Lexapro
703, 4, anxiety and sleeplessness,Decreased sexual drive_ weight gain_ now after taking this drug for 2 1/2 years I cannot stay asleep...could be because I just quit smoking cigars cold turkey after 15 years too.,This is a wonderful drug. I am an alcoholic in recovery and sober 15 years. I recommend (if you are in recovery) NOT going on anything for as long as possible since you could mask your REAL problems and end up drinking or using drugs again. I would also recommend lots of cardio exercise. Golf is not exercise and I love to play a lot but NOT in place of cardio. There is not question Lexapro works if you do the other things I mentioned in or out of recovery it doesn't matter but seeing a therapist or going to some type of self help 12 step program will help no matter what if you accept you are in need of HELP. I never thought I would feel NORMAL....I never felt normal and thought I never would. I only felt comfortable with people when I was under the influence of something. You are going to have some kind of side effects but Lexapro is a good_ clean drug. I have taken Zoloft and then Paxil before Lexapro...Paxil was the worst for weight gain and Zoloft the worst for getting an erection. With both Paxil and Zoloft I felt way too relaxed. My house could burn down and I wouldn't give a sh_t. I am now switching to something else but not sure what yet. Cymbalta is what my Dr. suggested but each time you switch you have to get ready for that OUT OF BODY experience in the way you are going to feel.

However_ when my panic attacks were getting way out of control I knew i had to start. I am not going to lie the first couple of days were horrible. I became so depressed_ I though i was never going to be happy again_ my anxiety spiked as well. I could not sleep at all. I would fall asleep for and hour or so_ then wake up and not be able to go back to bed. I had horrible_ horrible nausea. I can not believe i never vomited. I could not function and just wanted to curl up into a ball and die because I felt so horrible (I was NOT suicidal though_ I had no thoughts of killing myself). After a brutal 5 days things started to turn around. It seems like after day 6 all the horrible side effects completely vanished like i had gotten over a terrible illness. Now I have been on lexapro for four months and I feel wonderful. I am so happy all the time. NO panic attacks. I feel no anxiety even over little things that would make most people anxious. Seriously my life has done a 360. There are only a few complaints I have but I would rather deal with the side effects that the anxiety. I have to sleep way more than I use to_ about 10 hours to feel fully rested. If I do not get enough sleep I need to nap_ which I never did before.

Side effects after first four months - weight gain_ yawning fits_ daytime sleepiness.,Before taking Lexapro_ I was having panic attacks at least twice a week. I went along hoping against hope that the panic attack I had one day would be the last one. I would go along a few days without one and then be so disappointed to have another one. I was having a lot of these while driving and I was beginning to avoid driving to prevent them. It was getting quite debilitating because my work requires driving to different places at times. Now_ for the 10 months I've been taking Lexapro_ I've only had three instances where I could feel myself going into a panic attack - this is a huge decrease. This Lexapro treatment has at least allowed me to continue driving and going to work. Without it_ I would be a mess right now. Most of the odd side effects went away the first few weeks after I started taking it. The remaining side effects - weight gain and sleepiness - I'm in the process right now of deciding whether or not I want to live with them. The alternative right now would be having the weekly panic attacks again which I am in no mood to continue. I also notice not worrying so much anymore about things - I used to worry about everything. Problems  don't seem so overwhelming. I also have noticed that I don't get so upset and rattled by other people's rudeness or nasty comments anymore.

It's fair to say that I can expect some very MILD dizziness/nausea on day 4. This can be suppressed by keeping food in your stomach & by drinking lots of fluids (ex. ginger ale). Those nastier_ adverse side effects that you're reading about_ can be smothered during the onset of this drug. You have to do your research and it definitely helps if you've had experience with antidepressants in the past. For those of you who are new_ and haven't explored the chemical world the way I have_ let me give you some advice -- advice that can be trusted. This is my 3rd experimentation of an SSRI. After a year of sobriety_ I've decided to wander away from Prozac and try something less potent...something with fewer side effects. If you feel your needs are different_ then you may prefer the 'zombification' of Prozac. OF COURSE_ this depends on dosage,EMAIL ME FOR MORE INFORMATION_ AS I WAS CUT OFF BEFORE I REACHED THE IMPORTANT BITS*** I've noticed that some users here are less experienced than others. On top of your overall anxiety (including GAD_ agoraphobia_ etc.) you may suffer from Dysthymia: a milder form of depression where those afflicted are usually able to continue working and conducting daily activities_ where it often presents itself during childhood or adolescence. Symptoms such as poor school performance_ social withdrawal_ shyness_ irritability_ hostility and frequent conflicts with parents are the first indicators of the affliction. If you're not immobilized by your anxiety_ then this is for you. First of all_ everyone has a different reaction to SSRI's_ depending on their own_ unique state. If your depression is mild_ and you're generally finding yourself less motivated (ex. waking up in the morning dreading the day_ rather than eagerly jumping out of bed with a smile on your face_ with motivation to be productive) then this very well could be the subtle pill for you. Based on the few side effects_ and my knowledge of SSRI's_ I can immediately tell you that lexapro is a safe medication...If you are fairly healthy and within 18-35 years of age_ you shouldn't experience anything terrifying. You NEED to have the correct mindset. Try to think of this pill as a means to the end all of your troubles.,M,23,3  days,4/11/2009Email,Lexapro

I was not worried about it either_ but the productivity effect was worse than when I had significant depression !. Completely got rid of my ""fight or flight"" reflex_ which is not cool if you live in a jungle.  Quite significant indigestion_ very flatulent (not smelly_ but not controllable).  Going to toilet (faeces) at least 4 times per day_ significant weight gain (about 8 kg of fat in the first month)_ loss of strength & wish to exercise.  I tapered off very gradually but problems persisted and switched to St John's Wort.  Mistake !  Mild Seratonin Syndrome for about a week.  (Crawling skin_ very irritable & restless_ sweating_ headache_ sleepy but anxious.)  Not the drug for me_ but others I have spoken to are very happy.  Be very careful in the transition.  I must have had very little in my system and went only to a herbal preparation_but still had a pretty unpleasant experience. If I had gone from full dose to another strong medication it would have been quite threatening I believe.",M,39,45  days,4/4/2009Email,Lexapro

753, 4, Anxiety_ Depression & Insomnia,Stomach discomfort_ initially some night sweats_ jaw clenching.,I started taking this medication when Prozac_ which I'd been on for 13 years_ no longer seemed to work.  The most immediate side-effect noticed was extreme stomach discomfort.  It's not like a sore stomach_ but it feels like your abdomen is tensed up_ which I initially mistook for a sign of additional anxiety.  However_ according to my doctor this tension in the stomach area is purely a chemical reaction to the medicine and not connected with an emotional state.  His notion is validated by my increased ability to sleep_ which is never possible if I'm anxious.  This stomach discomfort has faded about 75%_ as my body acclimates to the drug.  I initially also experienced extreme night sweats and some jaw clencing at night_ but these passed within a week.  I sleep better_ but not perfectly.

I'm sleeping so I don't need the sleeping pills that I think were causing the anxiety and the panic attack I had.  I take things in stride and nothing ruffles me up.  I will say that you do tend to get almost too relaxed about life and work.  I can actually leave some dust on something and go to bed without cleaning it.  I guess I was a little compulsive.  Not anymore.  I use to have brain zaps and it scared the hell out of me and those are gone. I may have a brief one if I've had a stressful day at work.  I use to like to have a couple of glasses of wine once in a while.  I haven't ventured into that with Lexapro because I've read about people blacking out so I guess I've quit drinking too.  If I do drink it's 1/2 glass of wine and that's rare.  I hope this helps.  Dry mouth is my only side effect.,,F,52,2  years,3/10/2009,Lexapro

757, 1, Anxiety,Appetite increased; apathy; decreased sex drive; increased anxiety.,I honestly believed Lexapro was helping me_ but the truth is it made me apathetic and it made me not care about important things.  I have ulcerative colitis and my doctors (a general practitioner and a gastroenterologist) agreed I should take Lexapro because I was having bleeding episodes so frequently that my graduate studies were affected.  I was on and off steroids for the bleeding and my life was a wreck.  BUT_ after 14 months on Lexapro_ I got off of it.  It has been a week and a half and I am amazed that I care about things again and my anxiety has actually decreased!  I was STILL bleeding on Lexapro and although the anxiety diminished for a while_ it returned after several months.  It also lowered my sex drive_ affected my appetite_ and I am 100% sure it had a negative impact on my decision-making abilities.  And I was only taking 5 mg a day!

I have never had more interesting dreams than those I had on Lexipro -- I'll miss those:  very detailed_ vivid_ fascinating_ cinematic-like dreams.  Amazing.

In the past I would take Xanex occasionally which really helped me fall asleep and ease my anxiety yet I would not feel groggy the following day. My neurologist prescribed me lexapro claiming that it along with ambient CR (which did not help me sleep at all when I took it seperatley) would definitely help me sleep.  I feel like a walking zombie and not present in my body_ if that makes any sense.I only took one 10mg tablet. I can't think clearly and am not comfortable driving - I have 2 young kids and need to have it together.  This medication is clearly not for me.  I can't believe people are prescribed this medication and are not warned about its side -effects.  taking one xanex at night on occassion is far less intense compared to lexapro.

I see my dentist for regular checkups and cleanings every 4 months_ and I get x-rays every year. My dentist is aghast. Stress and/or anxiety and teeth grinding can cause bone loss.

I do feel a little queasy in my stomach sometimes and I'm not sure if my recent teeth grinding is caused by that. Over all_ I would say it's helped me along with my own behavioral discipline and willingness to get better. I've shed 400 lbs. through exercise so I suppose it hasn't affected my weight.

After a few more days I was extremely aggitated and couldn't sit still. My Pdoc prescribed Klonopin at night 5to help me sleep. It knocked me out until about 4am them woke up in severe panic_ racing heart_ tremors etc. I keep trying to take it hoping the side effects will go away_ but it seems like it's getting worse.

It was the first medicine I was prescribed when I was diagnosed with depression_ and even though I've had my dose upped 3 times (the initial trial_ which was 5_ 10_ & then 20)_ it still works really well for me.Of course as I mentioned if I miss a dose I get really depressed_ but after I take it there's an immediate boost in my mood and how I feel about myself.,F,20,2  years,1/31/2009,Lexapro

My doctor then upped the dosage to 20 mg.  The sleeplessness got worse_ I felt fatigued throughout the day_ had an ""out of it"" kind of feeling and was having a delayed reaction to things.  I hit a sign in a parking lot one day.  I saw the sign_ I saw how close I was to it_ but didn't react until AFTER I hit it.  A couple nights later I had a major panic attack.  The next day I cut back to 10 mg dose.  I haven't had any problems since.  I took Zoloft for a month and had pretty bad side effects from that.  So far I like the Lexapro.  Fortunately the only side effect I have experienced with the 10 mg dose is sleeplessess_ but I already suffer from insomnia so I'm used to it.

I never really experienced any anti-depressant effects_ I just couldn't think about suicide. Which is weird_ but that's how I've felt on Effexor and Zoloft as well. I was taking 20mg for a while_ but I got tired of not being able to sleep_ drink alcohol_and the sexual side effects sucked. I had to take a sedative to sleep at night_ and I had the worst dreams.

801, 3, GAD/Depression,Nausea in the mornings.,I started Lex 1/10/2009. I must say I was scared to. I was on Celexa briefly and Paxil in 2000. But stopped due to sexual side effects. I then went to a doctor in 2008 for anxiety and they put me on Prozac. That was the worst experience of my life. The dreams were horrible_ it made my heart race_ now I'm no doctor_ but if someone has anxiety issues_ the last thing that person wants is a rapid heart rate. So I stopped after a month on that. I revisited the whole depression/anxiety issue in late 2008. I had a sleep study to see if APNEA could be causing anxiety and depression_ the test came back negative for APNEA. So I told my counselor that maybe I needed something for depression. It's hard to self diagnose if you have anxiety because of depression or vice versa. She prescribed Lexapro as she says she sees great results with it. I of course searched the internet and read the horror stories as well as the success stories.

Went on it for several months when my GAD became tough to manage using less involved alternatives (exercise_ chamomile tea_ occasional Clonazepam or Ambien).  It was great for anxiety and also helped me get past social anxiety so dating_ going to parties_ socializing became easier.  BUT - I'm super-weight conscious and I gained maybe 10 to 15 lbs.  My psychdoc was cagey about weight gain when I asked about it before going on it; my primary doc was more up-front and confirmed it's a weight gainer and probably changes your metabolism.  After several months I went off it and the weight came off pretty steadily in about 8 weeks_ but I had to exert major effort - bike to work every day_ 1 hour cardio classes at the gym_ swimming_ etc.  (By the way_ my primary doc does extensive lab work on me every year and he figures the Lexapro is responsible not only for the weight gain but elevated liver numbers and some other not-so-great things,M,39,7  months,1/19/2009,Lexapro

Kind of reminds me of the few times when I've been sick and taken sudafed_ except there's more sleepiness. It's not exactly a pleasant feeling and I hope that it'll pass_ as I am not interested in remaining a semi-zombie--there are lots of things I want and need to do in my life. I am taking 5 mg.

Lexapro was the fourth med my doc had me try_ after Celexa_ Cymbalta and Pristiq either failed to work or had intolerable side effects. 10 mg Lexapro caused mild nausea which went away after a few days.  It also caused mild mouth dryness which did not resolve. Lexapro made my fatigue much worse and helped none of my depressive symptoms.  In fact_ there were a few days in the first two weeks when I felt much more hopeless and depressed than usual. After 2 weeks_ my doc increased my dose to 20 mg.  My nausea returned and I noticed a slight elevation in mood for a day or two_ then I ""returned to baseline"" (except for my fatigue_ which worsened on the higher dose).  I had mild restless leg syndrome on Lexapro_ which became worse when I went up from 10 to 20 mg.  I had to take 0.5 mg Klonopin every night to keep the RLS at bay.  It was really_ really hard to wake up in the morning on Lexapro.  There was one workday I thought I was g",No real positives or benefits to mention.

831, 4, depression,I felt a bit lightheaded at first but otherwise it worked very well on the depression. I did start feeling kind of detached though. I'd a lot of anxiety before and after taking it a few months I started getting kind of careless as though 'everything will work out'_ even when I should've been more careful about things. A major side effect for me personally was that I started drinking like I never have before. Almost every day! I would blackout regularily... but I was always happy! I'm down to 5mg daily and will quit in the next week. Started taking Wellbutrin_ we'll see how that goes.,Even though it's not supposed to have any counter-indication with alcohol... it sure turned on my latent alcoholism! I'd still recommend it to others though.,F,33,1  years,12/22/2008Email,Lexapro

However_ after 2 months_ the weight gain became terrible and my blood sugar was becoming pre-diabetic range. 125ml fasting. I gained nearly 35 lbs in 3 months and felt extremely sluggish.

The side effects were severe_ but diminished as time passed_ and have become tolerable within 2-3 months. For me it became a question of balance: Lexapro side effects vs. depression and its side effects.After 1 1/2 years on Lexapro_ I believe that it has a very short shelf life_ less than 30 days_ and is extremely sensitive to temperature/humidity fluctuations & extremes. Every month_ when I'm down to my last 3-8 pills of my supply_ I notice that I get depressed often and have sudden mood swings. This is consistent every month. When I start a 'new' 30 day batch of pills_ I go through minor side effects for a few days.I'm a stay-at-hme-dad of toddler & infant and am glad that I'm not depressed with anxiety while raising them.

Also_ maybe some difficulty with mental processing_ but this was not extremely noticeable.,"I found this drug (10 mg/day) to not really do anything but decrease my sex drive and give me an overall sense of ""who cares?""  I kind of felt like Peter in Office Space.  This is great for a few days (and as a fictional comedy)_ but it can really interfere with daily function (and it did).  I did not really realize how much stuff I had neglected until after I was through withdrawing from the drug. After about three weeks of weaning myself off_ and another two weeks without it in my system_ I began to feel normal (which means more anxious_ but at least I started dealing with the things which stressed me out).

I stopped taking Lexapro this past September because of the weight gain and now my panic attacks are back_ and I am feeling my Mom's passing all over again. The Lexapro didn't stop me from feeling the passing_ but now I am feeling the anxiety of the separation from her. It's horrible. So now I have to go back on it_ maybe every other day or try Buspar. I read somewhere that a person wondered if somehow the Lexapro changed her brain chemistry to where now she HAS to take it because she is anxious all the time now_ worse than before she started it. I am beginning to wonder that too. The side effects at first were headache_ fixed with Tylenol.

I have mixed emotions about this effect. I am able to do more during the day_ my appetite has decreased_ I do feel very slightly high_ but tired yet energetic. One weird aspect to sleep deprivation is I had lucid hallucinations at night in the dark with closed eyes (not scary but rather funny which is unusual). The worst side effect noticed are my teeth. I clench and grind them without knowing_ and I sometimes feel they are moving a bit. I wouldn't want my teeth to fall out. Even soft foods like spaghetti can be a bit uncomfortable.

Having said that_ there are people out there who swear by this stuff and say it saved their lives.,If you are taking this for the first time_ start with 1/4 pill to make sure it agrees with you_ also make sure there is someone around who can care for you if you have a bad reaction.  Odds are against it_ but if you are the 1 in 100th person_ it can be really bad.  I would be especially careful if you are already a hyper-energetic type person because these are the people who seem to have the worst effects.,F,41,1  days,11/8/2008,Lexapro
881, 4, Panic Attacks,It has a pretty big numbing effect_ but I lowered my dosage extremely.  I only take 5mg a day compared to 20mg when my panic attacks started up.  Sex drive took a hit for me.  You'll feel a bit numb at first and may have trouble adjusting_ but you'll start cruising and it's done a great job on suppressing panic attacks.  But be warned this drug has a big zombie effect.,Overall this is a good drug.  I tried a few other anti-anxiety drugs like paxil_ welbutrin_ prozac all made me go crazy.  Lexapro is the lesser of the evils imo,M,26,4  years,11/6/2008Email,Lexapro

I was on 15mg and had absolutely no side effects_ I felt it had worked wonders for me. I started noticing my hair was thinning at about the 1 year mark. That made me very upset_ and because i was in a much better place in my life_ i decided I wanted to start weaning off. Within a 3-4 month period i tapered down to 2.5mg_ and then had a severe insomnia episode which is still going on_ and i was advised to increase the dosage again. I was at 5mg for about 3 weeks_ and for the past 3 days tried to go up to 10mg and have had HORRIBLE side-effects.

I've tried all other medications in the past_ but this one works the best. I would recommend it to anyone else that experiences Anxiety like I do. I used to not be able to communicate or go on interviews_ my anxiety would get the best of me. Also_ if I even try to get depressed_ the lexapro blocks me from getting to that state.

At higher doses I felt very tired and had very vivid dreams_ which were neither pleasant nor bothersome (more confusing than anything). I took a holiday from this drug for several days_ and experienced the withdrawal symptoms noted to the left. Since then I have found a good dosage for me (7.5mg/day) and added 150mg Wellbutrin to balance out the side effects_ which it has a done a very good job of. So far this drug has been good to me_ and made me not only less anxious but much more comfortable socially (a problem that I didn't even notice I had until starting Lexapro).

I still have the occassional heart flutter/palpitation which I have been assured are benign_ still a little scary and would normally trigger panic episodes until lately.

I'm also more nervous in many situations than I was before starting_ particularly socially_ and feel less urgency about completing tasks.Lexapro may have helped me with the suicidal thoughts that led me to treatment.

Dulling of emotions_ positive as well as negative - don't get as sad_ but don't experience nearly as much joy_ either - which makes it difficult for me to use my emotions to evaluate a situation. I have to rely on what I think_ rather than on what I feel. A bit of a handicap for an artist.,My doctor diagnosed me with life-long Dysthymia and speculated that I may very well be on Lexapro for the rest of my life. Lexapro has removed the constant negative thoughts that I have experienced all of my life and that impeded my ability to do anything. However_ I now lack any sense of urgency_ taking a great deal of time to do almost any task. I marvel at what I used to get done in a day. If my partner didn't nag me every day_ I probably wouldn't accomplish much of anything productive_ which has become an issue in our relationship. I'm not just sitting around in a daze - if anything_ I am more busy than ever_ I just don't seem to be accomplishing as much. I tend more carefully to all of the details because I don't feel quite as sharp. I find myself reading sentences 2-3 times before I get their meaning and check anything I write multiple times and I find it much more difficult to follow logic_ a prior strength. The lack of emotions is disconcerting. I used to navigate my world thro,M,51,3  years,9/5/2008Email,Lexapro

920, 4, anxiety_ some depression,In the beginning_ I had a few minor problems such as sleepiness and decreased sex drive.  However_ now after a year of taking it_ I have developed horrible migraines(never had them before Lexapro) I have absolutely NOOOOO sex drive.  I have gained 30 pounds over the last 5 months.  I get this horrible crawly feeling in my legs at night.(I'm wondering if that's what they call restless leg syndrome)  I'm getting grumpier again too.  Needless to say_ I have now started to wean myself off of it.  See my additional comments.,Despite the side effects I have recently developed_ I believe Lexapro was a life-saver.  I became a whole new person.  My family noticed a big change.  Before Lexapro_ I was a yeller.  I was anxious all the time.  I never slept. I cried at the drop of a hat.  I had chest pains from the anxiety and even developed PVC's.(skipped heart beats)  After Lexapro_ nothing bugged me.  I slept like a rock.  My family enjoyed being around me.  I've actually learned alot about myself and I hope that being off of it_ a little of what I learned will stick with me.  I pray daily that it will.,F,36,1  years,9/3/2008,Lexapro
921, 4, Anxiety / Depression,None except I suspect it may be the cause of ejaculation problems (took longer to get off).  I use condoms and with some gals I can get off only 30% of time but with others who like to get on top and can go long time I get off 80% of time.  I am unsure if the delayed orgasm is entirely due to Lexapro as I am under treatment for hypertension and who knows what aging process contributes.  I use Viagra (100 mg)  and take it on an empty stomach about 1 hour before sex.  So far this year I have had about 60 sessions with 9 different gals ranging in age from 21 - 30 (strippers_ waitresses_ young married women).  Last 3 years averaged about 50 sessions.,I would suggest you considery carefully the side effects of this medication.  If you are having ejaculation problems have her get on top and if she can go long time helps.  Gals who give good foreplay help excitement_ but mainly I get hard just giving them sexy backrub.  While I was having my depressive episode_ sex stopped but resumed about 3 months later with stripper girlfriend (she kept asking how I was) as we had done 7 sessions before my depression (chicken shx job crap_ father in nursing home_ credit card debt_ disinterested wife) but posted 68 sessions(including a threesome with her and a gf) with her over 3 years after I rebounded.  I also had about 30 sessions each with two of her friends (bonus girls).  This year has cost me about $15 k in shopping money for all these sessions but it beats hell out of marriage!  I tell them I go a long time that I am not a 5 minute man and they enthusiastically want to take me on_ especially the younger ones.,M,58,4  years,9/2/2008,Lexapro

Nor the sweating which I had never done in my life_ and i am not pre or menopausal. I have also had hair loss but thought it was related to a wrong thyroid rx dose. I will cut it back to 1/4 and see if the long sleeps in the day_ hair loss and sweating go away...thanks for all the posts here_ very helful.,I began taking it due to extreme anxiety over money problems--I have been too sick to work for 3 years--and other very complicated issues I have to deal with alone regarding a house I own.

I felt so much better.  So much relief.  The stomach aches were completely gone_ I was alert_ I was able to concentrate and I had my optimism back.  I felt like I had my life back!!!I still have a little anxiety_ but I am able to cope better and deal with it.  I have very vivid dreams and despite being on Xanax_ I still have some trouble falling to sleep_ but once I'm asleep I stay asleep.  Orgasm is an issue_ but with some effort it's attainable.

929, 1, Depression_ also to get off Prozac,The most damaging side effect was that I became extremely irritable and angry - all the time_ and I expressed those feelings constantly_ with no self-control and no ability to monitor or edit my expressions.  It took me almost 8 months to figure out that these were side effects of the Lexapro.  Other side effects:  obsessive and uncontrolled skin-picking on my fingers - so bad that I would watch what I was doing and tell myself to stop and I just couldn't - it was literally constant; an uncontrolled craving for sweet carbohydrates resulting in a 15 lb weight gain in the last two months; tremendous fatigue_ no matter how much I slept; complete loss of libido; lots of skin irritation and itching with no apparent source_ such as a bite - I would scratch my skin constantly_ causing rashes and scrapes which took forever to heal.,I switched from Prozac (which I had been on since 1990) to Lexapro in January 2008_ and the side effects began almost immediately.  But it took me almost 8 months to connect the side effects to Lexapro.  The feelings and expression of anger and irritation were the worst_ as it caused a great many problems in my professional and personal life (some of which have yet to be rectified).  Within a week of stopping Lexapro_ the anger/irritability almost completely disappeared_ as did the skin-picking.  The fatigue has gotten better_ and the cravings for carbs is also improving.  The itching skin has also almost disappeared.  Loss of libido is still a bit of a problem.,F,55,8  months,8/24/2008,Lexapro

Always wanting to sleep.,Lexapro did not only make me sleepy_ it made me WANT to be asleep all the time and nothing else. I could not get enough food. I NEVER felt satisfied or full_ even at the end of a large meal. ALWAYS RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY! I completely lost any and all interest in sexual matters. I finally took myself off (very gradually)and now feel much better.

Occasional delayed ejaculation_ but more often than not everything works fine! No side effects at all after one month's use.,Lexapro 10mg helped me enormously. I had had a major breakdown associated with GAD. It took three weeks for the lexapro to kick in_ but when it did the anxiety lifted (not fully_ but I could function again)_ as did my depression. I didn't become the life and soul of the party (bit then I never was!)_ but I was once again sociable and able to interact positively with my beautiful children. My anxiety and panic attacks do durface occasionally_ but they are rare and less intense since taking lexapro. Whilst not a panacea_ lexapro has been a positive influence on my life. If you do try it_ please understand the first week or two can be quite unpleasant_ so if your experience is bearable_ stick with it (obviously_ if the effects are severe_ consult a doctor_ pronto). And please bear in mind that many positive experiences of lexapro and other SSRIs are unlikely to be reportedm wheras negative ones often are. Good luck to you all.,M,39,3  months,8/18/2008,Lexapro

Before I went on it I was always able to_ but I never put two and two together to realize that the medicine was the reason I couldn't anymore.,It has really helped with my depression and my ability to handle things. My anxiety is much calmer_ although still present. I haven't had any episodes or panic attacks since I started it_ except for a three day period when I couldn't get my prescription refilled_ so went without.

I believe my short term memory has improved. The sexual side effects have pretty well gone away. At least it doesn't present a problem any more. My one complaint is the weight gain.  I have picked up about 12 pounds that I can't shake no matter how hard I try.  I've kept exercising and watch my diet_ but Lexapro seems to drive your appetite and boosts your desire for sweets/carbs. This is the first time in my life I have had trouble keeping my weight in the range that I wanted it (normally less than 180) Other than that_ it has certainly done what it is suppose to do for me.,M,60,12  months,5/23/2008,Lexapro

It turns out that I'm extremely sensitive to this medication. If you have the extended sleep cycles issue_ definitely consult your doctor right away.  The weight gain was also horrible at that time_ and I'm still having trouble getting most of it off (have only managed to lose 20 pounds or so).  On the lower dose (1/4 of what I was on) I'm happy to report that most of my anxiety in social situations is gone.  But I'm still lacking in the libido department_ and still pretty damn scared of the med after all that sleep nonsense.,F,23,7  years,5/23/2008,Lexapro
978, 4, GAD_ depression_ mild OCD,Fatigue,I've been on Lexapro for only four or five days and I already notice a slight difference. I haven't had that sweeping_ crippling feeling of panic since I've taken my first pill and I'm used to having that feeling constantly. Things don't feel as devastating. I still feel more down than up overall_ but it's only been a couple days. I'm still irritable as ever by any extra stimulation (too much noise_ light_ etc.); that will probably take a few months to get rid of. I am sleepy though - not enough to where I can't get up and be out and about_ but if I have the option I'd rather lay in bed. I'm hoping this just takes away the negative extremes - this past year has been catastrophic with my anxiety and I'd rather have a couple side effects than go back to living that way ever again.,F,21,5  days,5/10/2008,Lexapro

I am also on Wellbutrin_ but need another drug to get me at full strength.  i've tried Prozac(no libido) and Effexor(didn't feel effective after 8 months).  I'm not sure if the upset stomach and drowsiness are side effects -- i have always had stomach problems_ but i only get them at night now.  And the drowsiness has only shown up in the last 4 months_ so i'm not sure.  I am happy with this medication.  i take 15 mg each day.  Started on 10mg.  In terms of libido loss_ my doctor suggested that i skip a dose if i know that i will be with my partner the next day.  i have found this effective in the right way.,F,35,1  years,5/4/2008,Lexapro

In the beginning I felt rather numb not happier. I have goten much calmer and was able to to face day to day problems without huge anxiety and stress. So overall - it probably saved me.Side effects included:First month or so: going back and forth from being quite and calm to being extremaly anxious without a reason especially about two hours after taking the doze. Very vivid_ weird dreams_ occasional nightmares every night for about 2 months.Dialated pupils after a few weeks of taking_ to the point of blurred vision. Gone after 2 weeks.Incredible sweet tooth - couldn't stop myself from eating sweets. Just eat cereal and fruit if you don't want to gain weight. This has subsided after a month or so.Constipation - didn't go away. I eat youghurts and this helps a little.The worst side effect that I still expirience are:Libido is nonexistan,I started with 5mg a day and worked up to 10mg a day after a couple of weeks.,F,28,5  months,5/1/2008,Lexapro

When I reduced dose from 20 mg to 10_ both completely went away. Now I have terrible acne and infected cysts under one arm and might go off it all together to see if connected.,Lexapro really helps with my anger problem_ especially toward my kids and husband. I did go off for a month and the inappropriate anger came right back so now I'm thinking of switching to another SSRI that doesn't cause back pain_ cysts and itching_ not to mention wanting to sleep 13 hours a night.,F,44,8  months,4/27/2008,Lexapro

But I havent had really bad stuff since the first day. No sexual effects as yet but its only 5 days in. I feel good_ and will keep taking it as Ive read the effects should pass. Will let you know.

The situations that would normally stress me out have not fazed me much_ so far.  As far as weight gain with Lexapro_ I've not experienced that yet.  Hopefully_ my appetite will stabilize now that my mood seems more balanced. One of the results of my depression was that I would lose my appetite or lose the desire to eat_ therefore losing weight.

I am much happier than I have been in years_ and actually enjoying life for the first time in many_ many years.  Lexapro may not be for everybody.

My doc has recommended that I add Wellbutrin to help with the lethargy. I'm going to try that. I've read that it can be a good mixture.

Hit a window of two days of horrible anxiety ten fold of what I had been used to dealing with.  Pacing_ excessive irritability_ mood swings.  My therapist          insisted to stick with it and I took 2.5 mg of xanax when it became unbearable.  Got through the rough patch and my doctor increased dose to 20 mg and now only problem is insomnia and slow to orgasm but no other sexual dysfunctions.  No weight gain but a little tired first week.,Battled anxiety for six years without medicine and finally agreed to Lexapro.  I read a ton of nightmare stories about the medicine and went into with a closed mind and a lot of unnecessary anxiety.  It has been 8 weeks and I should have done this years ago.  I recommend sticking thru the rough spell in the beginning_ keep to a very bland diet the first week or so and take it in the morning.  20 mg has been a blessing but it can be expensive.  Try the Canadian pharmacies online for generic lexapro..you can find a months supply of 20 mg for about $40.  It may not be for everyone but I was lucky to not have any terrible side effects.  The insomnia can be tough at times but I take a 1/4 tablet of trazidone and it does the trick.  Took about two weeks to feel the full effect.  Irritability is nonexistent_ no panic attacks_ pacing and anxiety are gone.  Just feel like I can relax whenever I want to.  No xanax for seven weeks now.

I still have my ups and downs_ but they are nowhere near as severe_ and I no longer have obsessive behaviors or  irrational fears.  My doc is adding wellbutrin to my scrip so that I can become more active (the lexapro didn't help with my lack of interest in activities and hobbies).  I encourage those beginning with this drug not to read about all the scary possible side effects_ but to really feel for yourself how your mind/body are doing.  There's so much negativity in the media about anti-depressants because of the very rare possibility of increasing suicidal thoughts/behaviors.  That said_ if you DO feel worse_ seek help asap.

For the time that I was on it this never lessened.  Within a few days I felt this vague_ flat feeling_ not just about myself but about everything around me.  There was this sense like I was just a speck of dust moving around in my daily activities.  It was hard to maintain my daily life of being a mother and going to school feeling like this.  It was hard being depressed too_ but this was harder.  I felt such a lack of caring_ so much so_ I stopped being able to crythere was just nothing there_ flat.  After about 3 weeks on Lexapro I woke up one morning and felt absolutely vile with images of hurting myself that stayed all day.  The next day I was so severely suicidal I found myself thinking about a plan.

At the time I started the drugs_ I was in a major depression.  Wellbutrin helped immediately to let me think entire thoughts again (without interruptions in my thinking because I felt so sad.) Adding Lexapro improved my mood.   I started at 5 mg and worked slowly up to 20 mg.  After 2 years at 20 mg_ my thoughts became bitchy and impatient again.  My psych recommended increasing the lexapro dosage to deal with it.  I chose the opposite path:  I tapered off both Lexapro and Wellbutrin and am focusing on nutrition and exercise to keep my mood steady and generally positive.  Psychiatrist disagrees with my approach and says Lexapro is a drug for life.  I am sleeping more deeply now_ without the intense anxious dreams that I had on the drugs.  I will go back on them if I have to_ as they did keep my super sad thoughts at bay.  Personally I think these drugs were a life saver to get me through",F,46,3  years,2/24/2008,Lexapro

Now_ after 4 years of use_ I am no longer depressed_ but I am exhausted all the time.  I spend most of my spare time in bed sleeping - I'm barely participating in life.  I seriously thought I had chronic fatigue syndrome_ but after reading about other people's experiences_ now I suspect it's the Lexapro.  I am unable to drive on the freeway because of panic attacks while driving.  Also_ my body fat has been redistributed to my abdomen.  Normally my waist is 10-12 inches smaller than my hips_ but now it is about 5 inches smaller.  Not a good look! My side effects from Lexapro are worse than my side effects from Zyprexa_ and that's saying a lot.,I've been taking one antidepressant or another since 1989.  Prozac was my favorite_ but it stopped working after 10 years.  I tried Effexor_ but it created blood pressure issues.  Because of that_ I asked my psychiatrist to switch me to Lexapro.  He seemed reluctant_ but went along with it.  I do feel Lexapro helped me recover from the severe episode. I started taking Lexapro in the 4th year of the episode_ and recovered in the 5th year.Now it's 3 years post recovery_ and I wish I hadn't stayed on it this long.  Because of my history_ I continued to take it as a sort of insurance poplicy against future episodes.

1054, 2, insomnia; stress,INSOMNIA; body tremor (extreme); clenched jaw; spaciness; apathy combined with irratibility; empty headedness; vivid dreams/visions.,I went to my physician yesterday because stress at work was creating a cycle of too much adrenalin and not enough sleep.  I wanted to nip it in the bud before it spiraled into something much worse (ulcers_ depression_ etc).  He insisted that I take a 10-mg dose of Lexapro for the next 10 weeks.  I took my first dose before going to bed (as prescribed).  My first side effect was flushness in my face_ then extremely vivid visions/dreams started.  I couldn't stay asleep.  Then my legs started twitching. Next the full-scale body tremors started and continued intensely for 30-45 minutes. Simultaneously_ I felt no anxiety about what was happening; it was as if I was detached from it all except that I was ticked off that this drug was excacerbating my insomnia. Very weird.  After a couple of hours I was able to doze on and off_ but at best I got four hours of sleep.  So now it is mid-morning_ bolts of electricity are shooting through my body_ my head feels like it is in a vice_ and my jaw is,M,55,1  days,2/23/2008,Lexapro

If I have a near miss car collision_ I hardly get riled up at all.,I started on 10mg and have stayed there.This drug really works for me. No more panic attacks at all.I also have heart arrhythmia (PVCs) and they have almost been eliminated using Lexapro. Overall_ I would say the side effects are very minimal.My recommendations to those would be to give the drug at least a couple of months before making any conclusions about it.,M,52,2  years,2/21/2008Email,Lexapro

By the 3rd month I felt so good and I found that I can overcome the tiredness by exercising. Yes_ you practically have to drag yourself to the gym_ but after 20 mins exerciseing_ the tired feeling will go away. I sleep better_ look better and feel better_ and my husband doesn't mind having to work a bit harded in the sex dept. to have a happy wife. Don't believe some of these posts!!

I thought it was the neurontin which kept me up last night and caused me to wake in the middle of my sleep with a dry mouth and pounding heart...but now when I read these postings I realize that the side effects are from lexapro...a friend of mine is on it and seems happy.  I will try it for two weeks and if it doesn't work_ I'm going to ask for wellbutrin...i just don't want to deal with the crappy side effects and potential symptoms of withdrawal...is there anyone who has had a positive withdrawal story?,F,25,1  days,2/20/2008,Lexapro

But then half hour later I was in the middle of a full blown panic attack_ something I'd never experienced. Thought I was going to have to lie down in the middle of the street because I was so flushed_ dizzy_ lost my breath. Later_ I felt better_ but not myself still_ like I'd had too much coffee.

1103, 3, anxiety/depression/ocd,"jaw clenching (really bad)_ feeling ""spacey""_ headache_ jitters_ slight insomnia_ tremors_ diarrhea_ dilated pupils_ forgetfulness_ general malaise_ muscle aches_ nausea and occasional extreme hunger (I think this medication plays havoc with blood sugar - a low-carb diet -- like South Beach -- while on it might stave off any weight gain.)","This is the third day.  First two I took 10mg and after reading this site_ I reduced that to 5mgs today to allow my body to adjust a little more slowly and the side effects are much more tolerable already. I've also noticed minuscule improvements in both my patience and not feeling ""overwhelmed"" with certain things -- little things_ like the dishes_ waiting on line etc_ which is pretty good for two&half doses_ so I'll stick it out. I'm a little worried about eventually getting off the stuff_ but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. (This isn't my first SSRI_ but the first that's had any effect since I took Tofranil in my 20's. Now *that* was hard core stuff. Eight weeks of hellish side effects_ so this stuff is nuthin.)",M,41,3  days,1/7/2008,Lexapro
1104, 4, anxiety,Side effects started with a loss of appetite (not such a bad thing really)_ slight nausea (gone now)_ chills (gone now) and difficulty reaching orgasm.  Twenty-four hours after switching from 5mg to 10 mg I had burning and prickling sensations in my hands (thankfully that only lasted around 24 hours).  I've had some strange dreams--one's that cause me to awake suddenly (often flailing around a bit).  Just today I noticed some muscle twitches in my legs and feet_ which is a bit worrisome.,The side effects make me worried I have some other affliction causing them.  The drug has been decent in dealing with anxiety symptoms.  I had been on Paxil_ which produced far less side effects_ although it stopped working for me after a few years.  Lexapro seems to cause more side effects although they aren't too difficult to deal with.,M,44,11  days,1/6/2008,Lexapro

1107, 3, anxiety & depression,The first two or three days_ I felt dizzy and tired. But that has gone away. I will be going back to the doctor in 2 weeks_ I am on 10 mg and I think we will have to go to 20mg_ because I still feel anxious (chest is tight_ heavy sighing.),I like this anti depresant better than Paxil which made me a zombie.

1108, 2, depression_ bipolar,Zero libido--I mean nothing_ after being switched from Zoloft which was not bad.  Unsteadiness_ yawning_ hard to make it out of bed.  Felt very emotional and would wake up crying many mornings.,This seemed to work with some promise at 10 mg.  I had some improved mood on some days and felt very sociable and outgoing but then it would fade off after a couple of weeks with obsessive thoughts returning.  Increased to 15 mg_ the same thing_ with this addition of causing my libido to completely disappear in a way that I have never experienced.  I am also taking Provigil.  Wellbutrin worked for me in '96-'03_ and I am taking it now_ but it seems to be ineffective.  I am phasing off Lexapro and Wellbutrin and moving on to Serzone; possibly substituting Adderal for Provigil.,M,46,5  weeks,1/4/2008,Lexapro

The only thing I've noticed is that I tend to be almost a little too happy_ too excited_ and in the evenings before I take my pill I'm almost in a drunken happiness.  I'm naturally pretty goofy_ but even for me this seems a little odd.  I absolutely need to be in bed by 10 pm_ or I almost collapse_ and in the first 4 months I was grinding my teeth and clenching my jaw very badly.  That has gone away.,F,26,6  months,12/31/2007,Lexapro

This started when I went from 10 to 20mg.  I'm going to go back to 10 and contact my doctor. Sexual side effect is also bad.  I have to use testosterone cream to help_ but still hard--not impossible_ just hard to reach climax_ and this started on a low dosage.,"I am surgical menopause and was taken off hormones due to cancer in the family.

1114, 1, depression,Lack of energy_ motivation or interest in ANYTHING,After feeling depressed for really no reason at all for several months_ I finally saw a doctor. I took the first dose of Lexapro as soon as I got in my car_ and I felt better just taking a step toward addressing my problem. I was shopping when it kicked in_ about an hour later.I felt high at first_ not too bad...then I had an uncontrollable urge to do NOTHING! I left my cart in the store and couldn't get home to my couch fast enough. I laid on the couch the rest of that day_ not caring or thinking about anything. I will never take this drug again. I suppose it could be helpful if your problem is angry outbursts_ but if you feel unmotivated already_ as I do_ this is dangerous! I'm thinking about asking my doc for Wellbutrin after doing some research_ but I'm scared after my experience with this. Any advice?,F,38,1  days,12/23/2007,Lexapro

It did make me very TIRED_ though.    So the doc prescribed 150 mg of Wellbutrin to take during the day_ and that has counteracted the fatigue.   I highly recommend Lexapro.  I am the side-effect queen!   If a drug sheet says hallucinations are a rare side effect_ I will be seeing things upon swallowing the medication.   LOL.   I'm really sensitive to stuff like that.   I am also prone to panic attacks.Let me tell you........NOTHING.    This drug has worked very well for me.,F,43,4  months,12/15/2007,Lexapro

The side effects (since gone) included dry eyes and mouth_ tight jaw_ headaches_ nausea_ spacey feeling_ insomnia_ sleep inertia.,This drug has made such a positive difference in my life. It lifted my mild depression immediately and took the edge off the worst anxiety. But the biggest change is that I'm no longer blowing up at my kids and husband for little things and day-to-day annoyances/problems. It has made me a more relaxed and nicer person_ and improved my relationships big-time.,F,44,4  months,12/13/2007,Lexapro

Even not taking it for as much as a week at a time has devestating effects on me.  I can not discribe the horrible disorientating feeling inside my head.  Its a kind of dizzy_ change in internal pressure_ elevator feeling.  I hope it will pass.  Has anyone stop taking this medication after a significant period of time and gotten back to normal?  I never had problems with anger before taking this only depression.  Now I have to be very careful to keep from flying into rages.

First day i had a sense of groggy feeling and an annoying dry mouth_ cried over my issues quite a bit_ no motivation at all to do what I am supposed to be doing. Headache is quite persistant_ Today I feel sleepy_ with the shakes and a little angered_ but its just my body getting used to the meds.

1124, 3, Depression PTSD,First two weeks mild nervous energy_ dry mouth and insomnia. After one year_ anorgasmic and strong joint pain.,Lexapro was initially a Godsend. I had become so depressed and angry I couldn't function and believe I had experienced dystymic depression for the last 20 years. Within two weeks of taking 10 mg Lexapro_ I felt like myself for the first time in years. My anger and lethargy disappeared. I felt energetic and motivated. All my relationships improved. Unfortunately_ in the last 2 months started to feel severe joint pain and did not know it was probably the Lexapro until reading others comments. Also_ its effectiveness seemed to be wearing off. And though my desire for sex went up_ I found it very difficult to reach orgasm. I went off the Lexapro 2 weeks ago and my joint pain has subsided_ but I don't want sex and my depression and anger has returned.  I had tried Wellbutrin and Trazadone before and they didn't help my depression at all.,F,41,1  years,12/7/2007,Lexapro

After expelling all body fluids I started generating lots of saliva while having drymouth.  The saliva was sticky like a spider web and I had to wipe it out of my mouth with a cloth from 2AM TO 5AM.  The saliva would build up inside my throat and choke me unless I spat and wiped it out every minute.,DANGEROUS........

I was on the 10 mg for about 9 months and was having mini panic attacks_ meaning walking in an open hallway and I would have to grab my head because I thought I would fall.  Weird.  Stairs do the same thing to me.  At 10mg I had barely any side effects other than the mini panic attacks but the 20 mg....I don't like how I feel.

Worked my way from 20 to 30 mg over the years_ always at night because it makes me drowsy (and I had insomnia_ so perfect!)  But this past year I have experienced near narcopleptic sleepiness_ short-term memory loss and weight gain of 20 lbs.  Am transitioning off the Lexapro and on to Wellbutrin now_ and it's freaky! Cracked out one minute_ sleepy the next.  Is this the phasing out of the Lex or beginning of the Well?  Can't say.

Paxil was especially bad in this case.  However_ lexapro has had no effect on my libido.

I had a full blown panic attack (1st ever) three days into it. Very scary_ but my MD kept me on the Lexapro & gave me addt'l meds so I could sleep and ride out the panic. Then things evened out. I was thrilled how I felt. Sleeping better too. But migraines were getting worse. I went to a new neurologist who said Lexapro can help with migraines. He upped my dose to 20 mg. I had four days of a terrible headache. Called and he told me to up my dose to 40 mg! That made me too wiped out (tired) so I cut back to 30 and take it before bed. My migraines are much improved (down from 10-12/mo. to 3-4 per month) and I feel great...except for the anorgasmia.

Only side effect noticed was dizziness throughout the month.,Lexapro was a lifesaver for me.  I have had GAD since I was a teenager (originally misdiagnosed as asthma)_ but it was not properly treated until I was 25.  I have been on and off Lex twice now and most recently was on it for a full_ two-year period.  I had NO side effects other than those mentioned when going on and coming off the drug.  Absolutely no weight gain or a decrease in libido (although my libido isn't all that great anyway).  The longest I seem to be able to go without any medication at all is 6 to 8 months.

So_ I haven't been taking it and just taking the lexapro_ and I'm not have as tired or depressed.  Read the side effects on the web about it.

I cold turkeyed out_ had one headache and had my sex life back in two days.  I feel more alert_ and am sleeping better.  I understand that if this drug fixes your depression then it might be worth the side-effects you experience.  For me_ the side-effects were more than sufficient to cause what it was suposed to aleviate.  I gather that many MtF transsexuals feel anxiety about their libido and find the reduction of libido when using this drug to be a benefit.  That certainly wasn't the case for me.

1193, 4, Depression/General Anxiety,Sleepiness_Weight Gain_Decreased sexual desire.,I took Lexapro for a little over a year and it helped a lot for about the first 10-12 months. After that I noticed I was having a hard time getting motivated in the morning and was sleepy on and off throughout the day.  I still felt much better than i had though.  The weight gain was what did it for me. I think I gained about 20 pounds and couldnt take it anymore so I started to ween myself off of it.  That wasn't to bad it only took a few weeks and being off of it I still felt good so maybe I didnt need to take it anymore.  A year and half later Im feeling depressed again and Im thinking about going back on it along with talking to a professional.,F,27,15  days,9/30/2007,Lexapro
1194, 4, general anxiety disorder,none,I have been on 10mg for a year since panic attacks started after the death of my son.  Just recently I had my first panic attack in 11mos...out of nowhere.  I upped my dosage on my own (I'll tell the doc next week) to 15mg and am considering adding L-theanine to my daily routine.  I like it; I haven't noticed any side effects_ but perhaps that is b/c I was only on 10mg?,F,33,1  years,9/29/2007,Lexapro
1195, 1, Depression,None.,Unfortunately_ this medication did absolutely nothing for me.  I took the recommended dosage for around 4 months_ and felt no changes whatsoever.

1196, 5, Anxiety and Depression during chemo,Slight headache lasted 3-4 days_ loss of appetite lasted about 1 1/2 weeks.  Morning sleepiness lasted 3-4 days as well.  Insomnia when taken at night.  Switched to morning dosing.  Some insomnia problems still_ but I attribute those more to some of the chemotherapy drugs than to the Lexapro,"Being diagnosed with Cancer and facing 6 months of chemotherapy has been overwhelming for me.  Dr. originally tried Paxil which made me violently ill.  We moved on to Zoloft which was not as bad as the Paxil_ but still kept me up at night vomiting.  As a last resort_ we tried the Lexapro and I had zero nausea.  The other side effects listed above were minimal and went away within a few days.  Took about 2 weeks to ""kick in""_ but I'm feeling so much calmer and positive.  Lexapro is giving me the strength I need to face my battle with cancer.  In fact_ in some ways my mood is better than it has been in years.  I may have needed this stuff long ago!",F,44,2  weeks,9/28/2007,Lexapro

Next few weeks - sex died_ feel spacey_ a bit of an ADD effect_ dry mouth_ tired ALL the time_ mild headache_ feel NO emotion except anger.  bad mood and angry all the time.  bad impact on relationship.,This is some BAD stuff.  I had simply asked for something to help a bit with anxiety so they put me on 10mg a day.  Just wanted something to help with it and the result was a complete change in personality.  I couldn't feel happy_ sad_ anxious.  Emotions completely died... not to mention my sex drive.  Could still feel anger though.  Oh yes_ became VERY angry ALL THE TIME and I'm normally very good natured.  Definitely don't take_ it has a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde effect.,M,26,1  months,9/28/2007Email,Lexapro

1199, 4, anxiety/depression,Initial-brain zaps_ headache_ fatigue:  all went away after 2 weeksLater-Weight gain,This drug worked very well for anxiety and mild depression.  If you can tough it out for the first couple of weeks with the side effects...it is worth it. Really quite amazing. I was actually able to overcome a long-standing fear of flying. I have gained weight that I have been unable to lose with diet/exercise. I have discontinued my daily 10 mg dose to see if I can lose the weight.  I did not have any withdrawal side effects.,F,48,2  years,9/26/2007,Lexapro
1200, 4, anxiety_ mood-disorder_ depression,The best thing I can say about Lexapro is that OTHERS have noticed the change in before I did!! I started taking Lexapro at night in case it would make me drowsy. Had quite the opposite effect and it gave me insomnia_ but I've had trouble sleeping on and off for quite some time. Decided to give it a few more days before taking it in the morning. After about a week_ the insomnia went away. I've noticed that I dont fly off the handle like before. I'm able to handle stress better. My severe mood swings have improved alot!!,,F,26,1  months,9/25/2007,Lexapro

1202, 1, Anxiety,Long-term complete loss of sex life_ sleep disturbances_ tired and spacey all the time_ personality changes (anger_ irritability)_ weight gain,I lost my libido on Lexapro five years ago and it has never come back.  That alone should make you want to steer clear of this one.  It also made just about everything that might affect my anxiety worse (see side effect list)_ and ironically_ though I was not depressed when I began taking it_ its effects on my life made me so.,F,23,9  months,9/23/2007,Lexapro
1203, 4, Major depression and suicidal,Dry mouth_ some sleepiness and excessive yawning,This has been a god send for me.  Before I was barely functional and honestly might not be here.  Any side effects were _ for me_ tolerable compared to the benefits.  They pretty much disappeared after two weeks or so.,F,38,2  years,9/22/2007,Lexapro
1204, 2, depression,Wonder drug for several months--then downhill,"Was on Zoloft for 5 1/2 yrs-then to Lexapro.  It was GREAT!  I felt normal & happy.  But then I was sleepy so I started taking it at bedtime. I could sleep for 10-12 hours.  Then I couldn't sleep very long at all-a couple of hours/night.  FORGETFULNESS is a real problem. I have WEIGHT GAIN. Told the doctor_ that I wasn't sure it was working for me...increased to 20 mg. I have been having JOINT PAIN that must be a side effect.  I am having those paralyzing thoughts again ""that I can't do anything right"" etc.  I went back to 10 mg.  I go back to the doctor in a month or less.  I need something else.",F,43,1  years,9/22/2007,Lexapro
1205, 2, Major Depression,Mania_ decreased sexual drive_ inability to achieve orgasm_ dry mouth_ insomnia_ tremors,SSRI's can trigger mania in people with major depression that are actually bipolar.  I found out I was bipolar after taking Lexapro for a week.  I was consequently hospitalized for four days.  The research I've done seems to suggest that no other SSRI is as likely to trigger a manic episode as Lexapro_ and I had taken Paxil and Prozac before it.  Since the SSRIs are mostly the same and Lexapro is known for such extreme sexual side effects_ it makes more sense to just take Wellbutrin and avoid the sexual side effects and chance of mania or insomnia.,M,22,1  weeks,9/21/2007,Lexapro

Around a month ago_ my 63 yr. old Mom had just been weaned off from Cymbalta and placed on Lexapro for depression.   She had a long history of Mental Illness_ including psychotic episodes_ deep depressions_ suicidal feelings_ hearing voices_ etc. She was doing reasonably well_ except for a bit of depression and some insomnia probably caused by the Cymbalta.  Long story short--she got REALLY spacey and weird on the Lexapro (see side effects that I listed)--and on Sept. 3 she got one of my Dad's guns and committed suicide.  If I had only known how she was REALLY feeling_ I would've insisted that she check into the hospital... I repeat: BEWARE of this drug!,F,43,3  weeks,9/21/2007Email,Lexapro
1207, 4, depression,Dizziness. Dry mouth. Yawning. All left after a couple of weeks. Erectile disfunction. Inability to orgasm. Lack of sexual desire.,2 months now and so far so good. Lexapro has certainly lifted my mood and allowed me to think clearly and comfortably. It's also got me more motivated_out of my chair and into some mild exercise. I intend to stay on it for a while.  The only side effect that's really concerned me is the sexual one. However the inability to orgasm has been addressed by use of a prostate massager which works well despite being embarrassing. I'm slowly beginning to have erections again so I expect that eventually the orgasm inability will resolve itself. Another reviewer above mentioned in his case it took several months.I began with ten and moved to twenty after a month. I don't intend to escalate.I'll report again at 6 months.,M,52,2  months,9/20/2007,Lexapro
1208, 3, General Anxiety and Depression,Over the course of six months I still experience trouble falling and staying asleep_ severe jaw clenching_ low libido_ difficulty achieving orgasm_ and lethargy.  I did not have any of these problems prior to taking Lexapro. I have also gained 25 pounds while on Lexapro and I hike 8 hours a day for my job. The weight gain is not natural-it has to be due to the drug.,I'm am starting to wean myself off Lexapro this week. Hopefully it won't be horrible. It did help me with my mild anxiety_ but the side effects are now too great.  Depression has increased because I can't fit into my clothes and feel unattractive.  Hopefully I will be able to take this extra weight off after I stop taking Lexapro.,F,25,6  months,9/20/2007Email,Lexapro

Also_ I have continually had dry mouth and some weight gain. Overall_ BEST I have felt in my whole life.",I would just like to say to the people that tell others to not take this medication that you are SEVERELY impacting how others may get treatment. Go to a psychiatrist that will truly evaluate your situation and if this medication doesn't work then keep trying until something does. I would be dead now if my doctor hadn't put me on lexapro. The side effects are well worth being alive today! They were never severe enough for me to quit taking this medication. Also_ it takes two weeks for lexapro to build up in your system so you need to give it time. I am just so irritated by people who use there scare tactics so that someone else won't use a particular medication. Its that attitude that keeps others from getting the help THEY NEED! Every medication has SIDE EFFECTS! Aspirin HAS SIDE EFFECTS!!!! So please weigh the good with the bad before just reading these comments and getting so scared that you lock yourself in your house and dont get the help you need...,F,20,6  years,9/16/2007,Lexapro
1212, 4, mild depression,first month - fatigue_ dry mouth; second month - insomnia; lasting side effects - sweating,I became a more easy-going person on this drug.  Before I was tense and snappy and not getting along well with most of my family.  I noticed a difference within 3 days on lexapro - all positive.  After experimenting with dosing time (I now take it in the morning) and getting through the first few months side effects_ I am now content.  The sweating is annoying_ but manageable.,F,33,1.5  years,9/16/2007,Lexapro

1214, 3, depression w/bipolar 2_  GAD_ OCD,First week and a half increased anxiety and major sweating but that went away. Took Ativan as needed for the anxiety. Since then fatigue which has gotten progressively worse it seems with each day. Really bad.  Taking SAMe's (bipolars should be very careful about the dosage) and tyrosine helps but not enough. Now I have flu-like symptoms which are making the fatigue worse and I don't know if it's because of the Lexapro or not.  It is listed as a side effect but few people talk about it. I am getting depressed about the whole scenario.,Ever since I started taking it all my negative psychological symptoms started going away and contined to do so pretty quickly_  about 90% gone within 2 weeks.(bipolars are usually quick responders to SSRI's).  But then over the past three  weeks the fatigue has just gotten worse and worse.  I was optimistic about waiting out the full 6 weeks before making a judgment but I'm almost there and over the past few days I've gotten depressed and even started to have suicidal thoughts.  Don't know if it's just a realistic reaction to being so limited again in what I can do because of the fatigue AFTER such a long depression or if it is actually a symptom of the drug itself (suicidal ideation).  Either way_ it's a bummer. I will update this.,F,48,5  weeks,9/14/2007Email,Lexapro

1219, 4, Severe Anxiety_ Grief_ Depression,Dr. started me on 20mg_ did that for 3 days.  Felt 'wired' and woke very early.  Only 'half' asleep.  Cut back to 10mg.  Take it at noon_ rather than night.  Shakiness.  Tingling in arm.  Now near week 4_ diarrhea (tend toward that in past)_ strange though_ first 3 days on higher dosage_ noticed the opposite_ first time in long time.  Also_ opposite effect w/ alcohol.  I can drink more and don't notice it.  Not good!  Esp. since it's hard to fall asleep sometimes!,Lexapro has definitely taken away the terror of dread I'd experience.  Now into week 4_ my sleep is all screwed up.  I'll either not be able to get out of bed before 11am_ or wake way too early.  Also have Hashimotos and adrenal fatigue.  So I'm trying to rest an hour early evening.  I've got 4 kids_ and a photography business_ so it's tough.  Yesterday felt kinda nauseous.  Maybe it's a virus_ don't know.  Take 1/2 of a .25mcg xanax one or twice a day to help with sleep_ etc.  Started talk therapy 2 weeks ago_ after death of close friend a month ago.

1220, 4, depression and anxiety,I've been on Lexapro for 2.5 years and don't remember too many icky side effects in the beginning. Initially lost 8 lbs the first month on it_ but have gained 10 since then. Definitely have the sweats at night though_ not pleasant.,I gave this drug a 4 because like many others have said here_ for the first time in my life I felt 'normal' -- I could let things go. It seemed for me_ the missing link. I have suffered from depression since high school and tried to deal with it through exercise_ diet and therapy. Although all that helped_ I never felt the way I did when I started taking this drug. I still to this day reflect after a tough situation how different I would've handled it prior to lexapro. I cried almost every day and just felt like I was the worst person on earth. I've stopped re-thinking everything_ worrying all the time and honestly just started living! The only thing is_ I still get very angry at my children (ages 2 and 5) but I think it more has to do with dealing with toddlers. I thought I would research that a bit though and discovered this site.

I started gaining a lot of weight (30 lbs)_ so I decided to stop the meds. and the panic attacks came back almost immediately.  They were so bad_ I would pray that I could just go to sleep and not ever wake up.  I then decided that I'd rather weigh even 200 lbs. than go through those terrifying panic attacks again.  The next time I started by breaking up the 10 mg. pill in quarters and increased my dose by 2.5 mg. every 2 weeks.  What a difference that made.  No start up side effects.

What I should have done was deal with those things and not have taken Lexapro. Now that I'm pretty much off of it and I've dealt with the things in my life that were making me so unhappy_ I truly regret ever being on it.

1236, 2, anxiety/depression,weight gain_ confusion_ short attention span_ exhaustion_ sex drive issues,I started taking Lexapro about a year ago.  I had been on Paxil and Paxil CR for a few years_ and felt that they had stopped helping me.  The transition wasn't so bad_ since I just phased the Paxil out.  The Lexapro seemed to help for a while_ but my anxiety and depression kept breaking through.  I had terrifying PMS while on both Paxil and Lexapro...I wanted to hurt myself and couldn't stop crying/freaking out.  Would go through periods of time where I tried to seduce every semi-good looking guy in sight_ then lose interest after 5 minutes w/ them.  Other times_ wouldn't think about sex for weeks on end.  Now I'm going to try Effexor to see if that helps_ but every person is different.  I can say it definitely improved my anxiety and depression from what it was before I started on meds.,F,23,1  years,8/30/2007,Lexapro

My period usually is like clockwork but I found that it came early the first month I was on this medication as well as the third month.  It isn't as regular as it used to be.  I was very surprised how well it worked.  Within 2 weeks I started to feel my anxiety fade away.  I can finally sleep at night too.  I just don't have the energy like I used to.

My sex drive is still somewhat decreased but is coming back. I can now orgasm_ although it takes longer.  I feel much less depressed.  I can now go back to sleep after I awake at 3:45 a.m. to go to the bathroom. Rather than lying and obsessing for hours about negatives in my life. I have my configence back and my wife says I stay in a better mood.  I had noticed some short term memory loss (one of my complaints before Lexapro)and that seems to have improved_ or at least I'm less anxious about it. There is far less negativity in my thoughts and my sense of humor is much better.  I have surreal dreams but don't mind_ they are kind of fun.

My husband and I are planning on starting our family_ so my GP decided I should try Zoloft_ as it is the most studied medicine in pregnancy_ but after 8 days on it_ I was severely agitated_ almost to the point of being agoraphobic.  I went to see an OB/GYN and she assured me that Lexapro is as safe as Zoloft in pregnancy and if one SSRI works for me_ I shouldn't mess with it!  So_ I went back on it yesterday and almost immediately have relief from my anxiety.  If Lexapro does not work for you_ though_ try something else.

Diet curve?,Well_ I got on this stuff because I was having difficulty sleeping_ headaches_ an uncomfortable pressure in my chest and panic attacks as well as hightened blood pressure which my physician said was all caused by a combination of depression and anxiety. The first two days i had the worst headaches as well as nausea. It leveled out but on the third and fourth days I couldn't get any sleep whatsoever. And whether it was the drug or not_ I was definitely feeling really strong sexual urges but I wonder whether or not it was the drug because most people complain about the opposite lol. I couldn't focus at work and constantly forgot things. After weaning down from ten mg a day to five for three days I got off it. Also_ I only got hungry really early in the morning and really late at night. I lost four pounds for the eight days I was on it. Turned out to be more trouble than it's worth.

Suicidal thoughts (not sure if drug or not),I have suffered from anxiety and depression every since high school.  I was taking 10mg a day for about 8 months and I suppose my anxiety did go down.  The problem was that I drank more while taking this medication.  Another strange thing is that since much of my anxiety was gone I had an attitude that I did not care what people thought.  More confidence I suppose_ but this was not a good thing sometimes because I would drink and then watch out!  I would be a drunk person with an attitude of 'I don't give a sh*t!' One month I started to get severe suicidal thoughts.  I have had these before_ but I really thought that I may kill myself!  I decided to get off of the drug cold turkey to see if this went away.  It was not a huge deal just a little dizziness_ and some brain farts/zaps.  Not nearly as bad as paxil!  Now I am thinking about trying lexapro again because my anxiety is getting to be too much...

Clear headed_ balanced and no noticeable anxiety in situations where I normally would have anxiety.  However_ the past week or so I am so lethargic and it only seems to be getting worse.

It was very easy to stop taking I gradually weaned myself off of it after 3 months of use. The only down side to the medication was the weight gain and the lethargy that set in after the first month.,F,30,3  months,7/18/2007,Lexapro

I started with 10mg and had a week or so of moderate discomfort_ but at the same time felt my libido slip away. No interest in sex when it used to be one of my center focuses. Was not happy_ sad_ depressed_ just was. Upped to 20mg_ no help. Going through the motions. Wife liked the improvement in temperment_ but the cost is too high. I am looking at surgery again and may need it again_ but really don't look forward to it. Total lack of interest in job and life in general_ first time thinking dead may be better than live.

I still have emotions about everything but not always worrying or upset about everything.  I tried Paxil 4 years ago for 2 mos. and was a zombie.  The last week I have been having a little anxiety about things - I notice I keep taking deep breaths - but I still function and am not obsessing on things.  I am about to start my period so I am attributing the slight anxiety to that.  I am also in perimenopause.

Has helped me re-gain my confidence about going in to bars_ restaurants and shops which I was terrified to do because of the fear of having panic attacks! Subsequently the anxiety that developed as a result of panic attacks has almost gone. I am happy to continue taking them for a little longer.  They have slowed my metabolism and lowered my appetite a little.  I am quite health conscious and read some reviews where people put on a lot of weight.

He diagnosed menopausal depression and gave me samples of Prozac. Couldn't take that. Then he tried Celexa. I was curled up in my recliner in a fetal position after 1 dose. Then Lexapro. OK at 10mg for 6 months. Then it was increased to 20mg for 6 months. Then up to 40mg and within a week I have no idea what went on in my life. Thank God I got Bronchitis and didn't take any meds for a week and my husband could see the ""old"" me. My husband weaned me off of Lexapro but too late. My co-workers were concerned about my slurred speech and from there it went downhill. Even though my Director found out about my reaction she turned me into the Board of Nursing. Impaired on duty is anything including your own prescription. I hope this helps someone else. I could have hurt someone and not known it. My dr. called it a SSRI uptake idiosyncracy.",F,54,1  years,6/19/2007Email,Lexapro
1328, 4, Depression/Anxiety,Slight headache at times.,I was on the drug for a year and went off.  I didn't wean myself slowly so the headaches were severe.  I began going into deep depression 6 months later with sever anxiety that manifested while on vacation in Florida.  I had taken my scrip for Xanac with me and had to have it refilled while there.  When I got home I started the Lexapro again.  I had clenching jaw and nervousness with heart palpitations.  I just cut back on caffine and that helped a bit. After a month of treatment I am feeling great.  I haven't gained weight but lost some weight. That could be because I've a very physical job and it's summer.,F,52,4  weeks,6/18/2007,Lexapro
1329, 4, Depression and Anxiety,In the beginning a little nausea.,I took Lexapro for 3 yrs. The 1st year it was the best thing_ It worked wonders!! Then After the 2nd yr it started wearing off. I personally don't think antidepressants last that long in your system.,F,30,3  years,6/18/2007,Lexapro

This seems to be helping a little with the lethargy issues.

1334, 4, Anxiety around my Essential Tremor,foggy thinking_ confusion_ lethargy_ loose stool,My doctor prescribed Lexapro for me_ because I had built up an anxiety around my essential tremor disorder. She advised that I take it in the morning_ which I did. However_ throughout the day I experienced the aforementioned side effects_ UNTIL I started taking it at night before going to sleep. Other than the loose stool_ all other side effects are gone. Huge relief. It's also done wonders for my anxiety for which I am most grateful.,F,47,3  months,6/14/2007,Lexapro

1336, 3, Anxiety; anger,restlessness; sleeplessness; loose stools; extremely tired,I have taken Lexapro before_ 3 1/2 years ago while going thru my divorce - I was seriously depressed. Lexapro worked great and had me back to myself in 2 months. This time I have only been on Lexapro for 2 weeks. Started w/ 10mg for a week_ then 20mg (which is what I was taking 3 1/2 yrs ago also). I don't remember it making this tired when I took it before. I think you are supposed to take it in the mornings - but I almost feel drugged after taking it - almost like taking a valium. But I have faith in it and hope it does what it's supposed to. I haven't lost my temper since I started taking it....so that's a good thing. I hope the side effects go away eventually. I have slept better the past 2 nights. Time will tell.,F,38,2  weeks,6/14/2007,Lexapro
1337, 5, Depression,Bad:  Nauseated and jittery for the first few days_ like a sugar crash or a caffeine high.  Good:  I am sleeping like a baby for the first time in years.  I wake up feeling refreshed and rested_ almost instantly alert.  If I am sleepy at all the next day_ it is because I was unable (due to my schedule) to get a full eight hours' sleep_ not because of the Lexapro.  When I get eight hours_ I have no sleepiness at all.,I was on Wellbutrin prescribed by my PCP but she sent me to a psychiatrist because I was still very depressed.  The psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro because I was also having severe mood swings and rage along with the depression_ completely stressed out and unhappy.  He started me on 10 mg per day_ and I can honestly say that I feel better than I have ever felt in my life.  Crises are quickly put into perspective_ I feel hopeful and happy and content_ the kids' antics don't wig me out like they used to.  The fact that I am sleeping better_ too_ is a bonus_ because I was having a terrible time sleeping more than three hours at a time and spent a couple of hours each night tossing and turning.  Not anymore!  I love it!  I am so happy to have finally found something that is working for me.,F,39,2  weeks,6/13/2007,Lexapro
1338, 5, Adult Depression_ Irritability,Erectile disfunction_ difficult reaching orgasm_ slightly decreased libido_ occasional difficulty going to sleep,I was under severe depression and my mental health nurse practitioner recommended Lexapro.  I took 10 mg a day for a month or two with little or no change_ then went up to 20 mg.  Didn't notice any weight gain (I'm diabetic anyway and my metabolism is weird)_ just occasional difficulty going to sleep (again_ probably a product of my weird sleeping habits_ not the drug).  Difficulty getting and maintaining an erection and reaching orgasm and decreased libido_ but that was more of a relief for me!  What's important is that I felt better than I ever had in my life.  When I was depressed_ something minor happening at work could ruin my day_ but on Lexapro_ I was over it in ten minutes.  I was more active and stopped obsessing over problems that were never really problems to begin with.  Went off it in October and recently (late May) my depression came back.  I am going back on it with no regrets -- it certainly helped me before!  I would also recommend talking with a therapist for depressi,M,27,19  months,6/12/2007,Lexapro

After about a few weeks it leveled off.,F,21,2  months,6/12/2007,Lexapro
1341, 4, Anxiety_ depression,Extremely lethargic for first three weeks.  A little bit less so now.  Also sexual side effects due to tiredness mostly.,"I have struggled with severe anxiety_ resulting in low self esteem and depression for my entire teen/adult life.  Lexapro has taken off the edge and allowed me to be my real self around more than just my immediate family.  My reason for not giving it a five is due to the tiredness I still feel_ even though I have been on it for nearly three months.  Do not skip a dose.  I have noticed that the one time I skipped it I felt like I used to_ with feelings of low self worth and that nothing was important.  On it though_ I am able to joke around and even strike up conversations with strangers - something I never could have done before it.  While it has not ""cured"" me_ it has allowed my life to be more like I wanted it to be.  Even the inability to have sex as often as I used to is worth the trade off.  At least most of the time!",M,32,10  weeks,6/11/2007,Lexapro
1342, 4, Depression,groggy_ excessive yawning_ head acheys_ strong withdrawl effects,I started taking lexapro around December_ planning on stopping when summer came round again. It worked wonderfully. I felt pretty darn good. Some insomnia as they mention_ the sleepyness the next day as they mention_ headaches I dont recall them mentioning. But it did its job fine. The problem for me now is I went off of them two weeks ago and dang. Theyre a doozy to get off. I've had this constant Advil proof headache. Just imagine... standing on your head_ after or during spinning on a computer chair... after sleeping in way too late. Its that kind of headache. Not sharp_ but uncomfortable as heck. My eyes hurt... and dizzy. Very dizzy. Dazed dizzy. All of this leaving me bored_ irritated_ and coming of a anti-depressent_ a bit down. The pill works_ but watch out for the withdrawl.,F,18,6  months,6/11/2007,Lexapro
1343, 1, depression/grief,I took my first 10mg dosage before I went to bed_ about 3 hours later I woke up high... my pupils extremely dialated_ dry mouth_ anxiety_ racing heart_ jittery_ paranoia_ and mild halucinations of crazy squirrels. These side effects came in waves for about the first 12 hours_ then I felt more like myself with the exception of a severely painful migraine_ dizziness_ shakiness_ cold sweats and nausuea that lasted another 36 hours.,Needless to say I did not take another pill. I think it causes more trauma than it's worth; I seriously felt like I could die. I was scared_ but had the worst inability to cry or express any sort of emotion. My doctor accused me of taking drugs... only Lexapro_ doc. I'd say if you want to be a tripped out zombie_ then go ahead... it's not for me.,F,21,1  days,6/11/2007,Lexapro
1344, 4, Chronic low grade depression_ SAD,Slight tiredness which lasted only a few days.  Otherwise NONE.  Well_ I did gain 10 lbs_ but it WAS 4 years and I am in my 50s.  Not sure it was the Lexapro.,I think I did so well because my doctor started me on 5 mg which I took for about 2 weeks_ then moved to 10mg.  Over the years I took a higher dose in winter_ and was able to halve it during the sunny months.  It worked well for me in the early years.  I slept well_ had more energy_ enjoyed life more.  Over the past year or so I found myself feeling more and more lethargic and upping the dose had no effect.  According to my doctor it does stop working after a while in some people.  Am now doing a gradual switchover to Wellbutrin XL - on a low dose of both medications and have much more pep after only 3 days.  I would recommend Lexapro_ but work the dose up gradually to lessen side effects and be patient with it.  Do be aware of the possibility that it may stop working for you over time.  I wasted a few months of my life by attributing my increasing lethargy to my age.,F,55,4  years,6/10/2007,Lexapro
1345, 4, Major Depressive Disorder_ Anxiety,Inability to reach orgasm_ jaw clenching_ yawning_ vivid dreams,"I have been taking Lexapro on/off the past 1 1/2 years.  Mostly combined with therapy_ it has worked well with relieving day-to-day anxiety (more calm in perceived stressfull situations) and lifted me up from a major depressive disorder that I've had most of my adult life.  While it has helped me be a better partner in communication (and not having breakdowns) in my relationship of 6 years_ the sexual side effects have been TERRIBLE.  I cannot reach orgasm (and I had NO problem before) during sex_ or if I do_ it is almost uncomfortable.  I even lose interest while masturbating!  Embarrassing to say_ but true.  I am on it again for the past few days and my jaw is clenching badly.  My therapist says that it is ""anger.""  I'm not so sure.  The yawning was temporary when I started over a year ago_ but it was a little ridiculous.  I would yawn over and over during my hour commute to work.  Don't take this medication without therapy.  Good luck_ you're not alone.",F,31,18  months,6/9/2007,Lexapro

They said i dont seam much like a rubber band any more and that i was much more relaxed and happier.  I feel it has bennefited my life.  Just a little interested about the weight gain others have had.  I had lost 6 and half pounds.  It has changed the way i think about food. makes me feel fuller sooner.

1350, 2, anxiety and depression,initially increased anxiety_ flu-like symptoms_ all over aching which lasted about two weeks_ fatigue which lasted for 8 months_ suicidal ideation.,I was put on Lexapro by my P-doc after I stopped taking Prozac cold turkey. I pretty much crashed because I did not titrate the dosage down. I started having horrible panic attacks_ chest pains_ fear of being alone_ crying all the time. This had never happened to me in my life though I had always suffered from mild depression and depression runs in my family.  I started the Lexapro at a very low dosage and worked up to 20 mg.  After about two months the panic attacks stopped but I was so depressed I could not function.  I would sleep half the day and cry the other half. And for the first time in my life I started thinking about suicide almost every day. I thought that it was a function of my depression but as I recently found it was the Lexapro.  After 8 months of misery I cut the dosage of Lexapro in half to 10 mg and started 25 mg of Zoloft and within two days I felt so much better it was like a heavy weight had been lifted from my chest.  I realized it is important to take the SSRI,F,45,8  months,6/7/2007,Lexapro

Had pretty bad SSRI withdrawn symptoms afterwords been off meds for 6 months.  I tried Lex on 10mg for a week shortly after I stopped Remeron... the effects were wayyyy to strong felt extreme confusion_ agitation_ anxiety_ paranoia and panicky and soon as I stopped the med I was better.    This time I've started on 5mg the side effects are mild to moderate I can handle_ also I've been off previous antidepressant for 6months.

I started on 2.5 mg. to avoid the side effects then decreased it to 1.25 because of the zombie feeling_ now back up to 2.5 and feeling great.  For the first 7 days I was not sure about the drug but kept seeing tiny differences each day.  I think starting out on lower doses at first and building a base in the body first worked better for me. Taking 10 mg. might have made me stop it then and there.  I'm busy all day_ no dizziness_ laughing a lot more. I probably will never will need much more than 2.5 daily as I am a petite person_ but it's side effects at the low doses were gentle compared to paxil_ prozac and zoloft.

I actually made it to work_ but was unproductive the entire day.  I was very dizzy and felt like I was ""out of my body.""  By lunch time I had a debilitating headache and extreme abdominal cramping.  I couldn't sleep that night because my heart was racing and my head was pounding.  I felt terrible.  The side effects may be worth it if you are experiencing severe depression or anxiety_ but it was more than I could handle.  I will stick with natural remedies_ proper diet and exercise.

At first I was resistant but I was still having so many ptsd problems that my Dr. really urged me to. So I finally did when I really got desperate last year. After two months_ I already could tell I was more detached_ not reacting to things so crazily and irrationally_ not taking so many dumb things as personally_ not succumbing to paranoid_ delusional thoughts.

Even 5 mg was too much for me @ 115 pounds_ leaving me feeling as though I was constantly consuming caffeine though I only have 1 cup of green tea in the morning! I didn't like feeling so wired. Though I was a bit more chipper about my thoracic outlet syndrome_ my physical therapist noticed that my neck muscles were literally ""popping out_"" and she couldn't do anything manually to release them_ something she can usually do with ease.  Not linking the tight neck muscles to the Lexapro as of yet_  I decided to cut down to a quarter of a pill a day to see what 2.5 mg would do_ only to discover that a couple hours after taking just that little bit of pill_ my neck tightens up on me when I use my arms!

Before lexapro_ I had a terrible insomnia problem_ and took a lot of ambien. Now_ I don't take anything.  I think it is possible that the reason the number of migraines I had while I was taking it increased was because I had to decrease another medication (Sinequin) because it made me too sleepy.  Sinequin helps migraines.  The only really bad thing I found about lexapro was the horrible withdrawal for people with migraines_ and the effect on your sex life (which I understand is the same for all SSRIs.),F,57,365  days,5/26/2007,Lexapro

I started out on 10 mg and haven't had to increase my dosage in the 8 months I've been taking it. The first week was a little rough_ but my doctor warned me about it ahead of time.

I was really wary about taking any medication at first_ but I'm really thankful for how much it's helped me.

I cut down to 5 mg_ and my blood pressure stayed at about 124/84 until about 4 days after stopping.  It is now back to 112/72.,Lexapro worked great for my depression after only 2 days.  It did not do a lot for the anxiety initially_ but I only took 3.  The blood pressure issue_ however_ was enough to make my psychiatrist encourage me to stop.

Within the first two weeks on 10 mg it eliminated most of a lifetime of negative thinking about myself as well as a tendency for obsessive thought patterns.  There was still some residual depression and sadness related to old thought patterns_ but after four weeks even that was gone and for the first time in my life I have had nothing but consistently positive feelings about myself which has translated into my interactions with people.  The only side effects I experienced were some tiredness and the inability to ejaculate.  The tiredness was a non-issue since by taking it right before bedtime_ it helped me sleep much better.  Was again able to ejaculate within 3 days of reducing the dosage to 5 mg and so far the lower dose has not negatively affected my mood.,M,59,6  weeks,5/16/2007Email,Lexapro

I've taken Prozac in the past_ but the side effects were too much to handle.  My mind is now clear_ my thoughts are in check_ and I no longer have post partum.

For the first few days I took it_ I was extremely fidgety and hyper_ and I rambled a lot and talked fast_ but I settled down after a few days.  The only thing that really bothers me are the nightmares.  I often dream that people I know die in really random ways_ like having trees fall on them or being chased by alligators.  In the morning_ I'm so convinced that my dream was real_ and it takes me a while to realize it wasn't.  I also have some specific phobias.

The nausea was the worst.  Needless to say_ I did not take a second dose.  Today is day two_ and I am better today_ but still plagued by some nausea_ appetite problems_ dry mouth_ etc.  Wow_ can't imagine toughing this out for a couple of weeks 'hoping' that the side effects go away_ or that this med  would be worth it - especially in my case_ with basically just a recent flare up of stress and anxiety due to some life events and job stress.  I am heading for a few months of cognitive therapy instead.The irony of this is that my mother recently (4 weeks ago) started taking this_ and she absolutely LOVES it - no side effects_ has taken the edge off of her anxiety_ etc.  I had hoped that since it worked for my mother so well with no side effects_ that I might experience the same_ but - NO!

1419, 3, Anxiety,Initially I was taking 5mg/day_ which had little effect and I suffered increased anxiety. I had jaw clenching_ chills_ headaches_ loss of appetite. I then began taking 10mg/day and the axiety markedly decreased_ but i wake at night feeling hot flashes_ mild anxiety_ rapid breathing_ and restless yet tired. I initally noticed a decrease in libido_ but that has somewhat resolved. I also have blurred vision.,The question remains as to whether this drug's side effects offset the benefit from the decreased anxiety. As most of you know_ the latter can be terrible. There are_ however_ other alternatives such as L-Tryptophan of 5-HTP. For what I am going through_ vitamins B-6 and B-12 only worstened the problem - but this may help you. Excercise_ yoga_ stretching_ meditation_ and acupunture have been a tremendous help. My objective is to ween off of this drug and seek a balanced_ holisitic approach to mental (chemical) health (consider counseling as well). Good luck and stay healthy.,M,44,8  weeks,5/3/2007,Lexapro

1421, 5, Generalized Anxiety/PTSD,In the first week I had some nausea_ but that went away.  I had some night sweats that lasted about a month_ but has improved.  My biggest complaint is how sleepy it made me.  I could go to sleep at any time and I would have terrific dreams so I never wanted to get out of bed. Finally_ after 3 months that has improved a bit_ but it has not completely resolved.  I love the dreams!,"I have been taking 10mg since Feb and I love it.  I would venture to say I was a little depressed when I first started and that has definitely gone away.  My attitude is much more positive.  I am a little ""dead inside"" but I don't mind not crying at the drop of a hat.  I am not a zombie_ my sense of humor and other feelers are still intact_ I just am less likely to cry (which is a good thing).  My anxiety has improved a TON and as far as that is concerned_ my quality of life is much better.  I would recommend this drug to anybody.

1424, 5, Depression & Anxiety,Whenever one takes a new med one imagines all kinds of side effects_ and attributes them all to the new med. Remember that not everyone will react the same way to meds (including Lexapro). If you read about other people's side effects_ they might very well become a self-fulfilling prophecy in your own case. So keep this in mind when reading these posts.  I myself experienced a couple of side effects the first week of taking Lexapro (e.g. tiredness_ lack of libido)_ but these disappeared pretty quickly,I felt my depression lessen the first day I began taking Lexapro. First week on 5 mil_ then 10 mil_ which is my present dose.

He offered samples of Effexor XR or Lexapro. I chose the latter because I had used Effexor in the past with limited success. I felt better within days (whether the effect was real or placebo - who knows? but I felt better). I continued taking 10mg daily in the morning and am feeling much better. I seem to care somewhat less about bad things (and maybe a little less about good things_ too). I have tried many other drugs such as Celexa_ Effexor_ Remeron_ Wellbutrin_ Serzone but stopped because either they didn't work or the side effects were too much to handle relative to the benefit. I feel much better but look forward to the day when I can stop taking it.,M,37,60  days,4/30/2007Email,Lexapro

1433, 4, Depression,I have not really had any side effects.  I was tired the first few weeks but that went away.  I did lose 20 lbs when I started it so that was awesome!  Switched to Celexa at one point due to money issues and that was the worse 2 months of my life.  I was never as depressed before as I was on that - couldn't get out of bed and wanted to kill everyone.  Extremely homicidal.  It was horrible.  Started Lexapro again and leveled out within a couple of weeks.,I think it is an excellent drug.  It has leveled me off and I feel normal again_ not wanting to cry every other day and just sitting on my couch.  Everyone is different therefore the drugs work different for everyone.  For me Lexapro is awesome and I wouldn't want to take anything else.  I was very afraid of the side effects listed when I started - lost weight instead of gained and no change in my sex drive_ or ability to orgasm.  Those were the ones I was most concerned with.  I would recommend to anyone...but remember...it may not work the same for everyone.,F,30,6  months,4/26/2007,Lexapro

I switched to Zoloft for six months and did not feel well at all on it. Once I began taking Lexapro I immediately felt a difference. I have not had a panic attack in a month_ I am not as angry_ I do not obsess over things_ I feel happier in general.  Most people do not realize that it takes a full 6-8 weeks for an SSRI like this to begin to work.  Most negative comments on here come from people who have given the med barely a month to work.  Give it time to work and deal with the side effects- they are only temporary.  As for the people who blame these drugs for weight gain...I suggest working out and dieting while on them.,M,24,6  weeks,4/24/2007Email,Lexapro

Almost totally unable to orgasm_(vs. 3 a week average) dr. said this is normal_ that lexapro blocks off orgasm..Could change medicines to get back normal but new medicine might not work as well on depression_ which is worse than not climaxing.,Took  lexapro to help in battling with depression caused by huge financial problems_ such as IRS_  bankruptcy_ growing business problems_etc. Took for about 6 weeks 10 mil. then as financial problems began to ease_the depression began to ease. I cut back on my own to 5 mil.hoping to restore orgasm and reduce tremors. that was a week ago_ no results yet_ but Dr. said what I did was ok and it might take another couple of weeks to see results. Overall I would say that the drug helped me through the days of not wanting to get out of bed and the suicidal thoughts part of depression. Change in weather to springtime also helped. The drug definitely helps_ but other positive things must accompany it.,M,67,50  days,4/24/2007,Lexapro

Also_ my motivation's a little low_ probably because I feel more relaxed.,Other than the constipation_ this medication has been tolerable.  The minor weight gain I've had may really just be from the constipation and bloating.  All of the other side effects basically went away.  I had struggled with really bad generalized anxiety_ obsessive thoughts_ panic attacks.  Good things were happening in my life_ and I could only fixate and obsess about the negative.

Though_ depression started kicking in this year of college.  Based on my family history_ the docs said i should be prescribed on something.  I was excited about going on lexapro.  The doctors said an SSRI drug should help me with my anxiety.  Lexapro is basically an updated form of Celexa_ with supposedly less side effects.  The guys who created Celexa made Lexapro based off Celexa models.  They did this so they wouldn't lose money when Celexa's patent expired and companies made generic models.  I learned this because my insurance company wouldn't cover any Lexapro because they said Celexa ""was almost the same thing""........and it fucking better be....cause my college ass can't afford chipping out 80 bucks a month for 30 Lexapro",M,20,3  days,4/9/2007Email,Lexapro

Even better_ most of the side effects decreased significantly over time_ but I still get very tired and can't really drink alchohol.

The insomnia is getting very old fast; havent truly slept well in a week_ but I feel tired. I have lost three pounds since taking Lexapro. The only side effect_ besides the insomnia_ that has concerned me is the irregularity with my menstrual cycle.  Its more of an annoyance than anything. Overall_ I wouldnt rule Lexapro out just yet.,F,22,7  days,3/20/2007,Lexapro
1519, 4, Anxiety/Depression,Have really not had many side effects_ Increased panic at first_ and bad headaches from clenching my jaw_ but all that has gone away.,Feel Pretty good_ take 10mg a day. Sometimes I am forgetful of things and I don't think I care about as many things as I used to. But depression and Anxiety have basically subsided and thats what this pill is there for_ no?,M,20,2  years,3/19/2007,Lexapro
1520, 1, Depression,None whatsoever.,Drugs don't tend to affect me_ and this was one of them.  I'm still annoyed at my doctor for not switching me earlier - I just didn't know any better at the time. No effects at all.,M,30,1  years,3/19/2007,Lexapro
1521, 1, READ THIS,more anxiety depression can't control emotions.. restlessness zobie state can't snap out of my foggy state of mind.. really tired but can't sleep diahrea nausea Nervous felt like i was going more crazy...Stuffy nose...,ok.. this is a long story and i feel i need people to know it.. if you are goin to be takein any kind of anti depressant or anythin like that DO NOT go to a MD i highly recommend you go to a Physiciatrist.. i was on Biaxin and the side affects of biaxin are alot like what we would call Anxiety and or Depression.. so i went to my doctor about this and she prescribed me with Cipralex and Clonazepam to calm me down... and after 2 weeks i felt horrible so i went to a Physc. and she said that i am not suppose to be on anything.. i am not a depressed person and i do have anxiety but i would benefit more from takein group therapy then i would takein any kind of med for it... so if you are thinkin about takein this medication talk to a Physc first!!!!,F,20,2.5  weeks,3/18/2007,Lexapro
1522, 5, Depression,Decreased sex drive (but no problem performing)_ delayed orgasm (however_ orgasms seem a bit more intense)_ moderate night sweats (primarily legs and groin area)_ slight tremor in right hand (only briefly and immediately upon waking up),"My experience with Lexapro has been extremely positive.  The side effects have been very  minor for me.  The most striking thing about Lexapro compared to other anti-depressants I have taken is that I do not feel ""medicated"" or somehow altered.  The improvement in mood and outlook feels perfectly natural.",M,43,6  months,3/17/2007,Lexapro
1523, 4, Panic Attacks/ Anxiety,Initially for the first 3-4 days Nausua,"LEXAPRO does work and it helps you through those difficult times. DIET/EXERCISE is very important_ and if I can give any body advice it will be ""GET MOVING PEOPLE - GET SWEATY!"" It helped me alot. The weight gain is a problem_ but I will rather be fat and happy_ than thin and depressed. You have to see Lexapro for what it is - It is a drug_ it will have problem.  BE REAL about it!  It will give the SMOOTH ride - but the rest is up to you (diet/exercise_ relaxation).  I have been on 10mg_ stepping down to 5mg for the next few month to test the waters. :)",M,32,2  years,3/17/2007,Lexapro
1524, 3, depression/anxiety,I'm jittery and feel like I'm going to jump out of my skin after taking my dose. A few hours later that seems to cease and I become really tired. Having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep already. Clenching my jaw has gotten worse since I've been on it. I feel like I want to go run or jump up and down or something to get rid of this excess energy.,I am only on Day 2 of Lexapro and taking 10mg/day. I feel really strange but am hoping I even out some after being on it for awhile. I also had some really strange images while trying to go to sleep last night. I wasn't asleep so I can't call it a dream/nightmare_ but definitely strange nonetheless. I imagine this is what it feels like to be on crack.,F,24,2  days,3/16/2007,Lexapro
1525, 3, Post-partum generalized anxiety,"Insomnia!! No sex drive!!Weight gain.  Generalized ""I don't care"" type of numbness that I began to feel over time_ it almost made me feel emotionally numb. My insomnia got so bad_ I now have to take sleeping aids every night.",Lexapro helped me immensely in my first few months as a new mom_ when I would have a panic attack over almost any little thing that was new with the baby. It evened me out and calmed me down_ without making me feel sedated or changed in any way. The worst part was the insomnia_ but I was so happy with everything else_ I was willing to work with that. Now_ after some time I have noticed that the drug has made me numb towards things that I SHOULD be caring about. I no longer feel overwhelmed by being a new mother_ and have decided to slowly stop taking Lexapro. GREAT short-term help_ I just no longer feel like I have the conditions that it treats.,F,24,6  months,3/15/2007,Lexapro
1526, 5, anxiety/depression/panic attacks,Oddly enough_ the side effects I've expereinced have been for the better.  I used to sleep with a clenched jaw and have tooth pain and headaches as a result.  I now no longer clench my jaw_ and my headaches are all but gone.  At first_ I was very sleepy until I got used to the medication_ but that goes away as your body and brain accomodates the medince.  With regards to weight_ the medicine at first seems to make you careless about what and how much you eat_ but with time_ it's easy to regain that discipline again.  The only thing slightly negative to report_ is that I sleep so well_ it can be difficult to get out of bed in the morning!,This medicine is an absolute lifesaver.  If you are hesitant_ but are experiencing serious anxiety and depression_ I strongly urge you to give this medication a try.  I had never taken any meds prior to this.  I never even thought I would_ but then_ for the first time in my life at age 32_ I had my first panic attack_ that was followed by many more_ then social anxiety disorder_ general anxiety_ and some pretty bad depression followed by some obsessive thoughts.  I thought I was going crazy.  I am an analytic thinker_ and everything I was going through just made me think more_ and made it all much worse.  I am now feeling peace_ I am able to reason through things. I can envision the future in a positive light again.,F,33,5  months,3/14/2007,Lexapro
1527, 5, Depression_ Extreme Highs/Low Moods,Barely any_ Pretty bad constipation,"Lexapro has worked excellently for me so far. My symptoms were not so much depression_ as constantly variable moods. From really happy_ to really sad. It's really helped my relationship. Little things don't seem to bother me so much_ and i don't dwell on things like i previously would... and it's only been a week! I was worried about sexual problems_ but i haven't had any yet... I'm as excitable as ever_ and no probs with ""finishing off"" :-)",M,22,7  days,3/14/2007,Lexapro

1529, 4, Hot flashes,With all the worry over hormone replacement therapy_ my physician suggested a small dose of Lexapro to curb hot flashes_ and it works SO well for that.  An unfortunate side effect I had not expected_ though_ is that it does seem to hamper my libido--not orgasms_ but it does reduce my initiative.,The typical anti-depressant side effects of weight gain_ reduced libido_ etc. seem less extreme with Lexapro than with most meds my friends take.  I would recommend this to depressed people_ and also for menopausal women who don't want to take hormones. One warning_ though: if I miss a dose_ I'm mean as a hornet the next day--way more so than I was BEFORE taking it--it's like some kind of extreme rebound or something.,F,45,4  years,3/13/2007,Lexapro

Few months later after effexor was out of my system I tried lexapro again first at 5mg and then went up to 10mg.  I love it and I am finally feeling my old self again.,F,43,5  days,3/12/2007,Lexapro

1533, 2, depression,WEIGHT GAIN_ sleepiness,initially_ this medication worked very well. i was able to complete   a semester in school with a 4.0 and very little stress. anxiety was diminished in social situations. i was taking this while in recovery from anorexia_ and it didn't take long to notice the weight gain (about 10-15 pounds in 10 months). i freaked out and quit it cold turkey (DON'T DO THIS!!) and i had horrible withdrawals. i would never take it again_ due to the weight gain and lethargy.,F,19,10  months,3/12/2007,Lexapro
1534, 4, Depression_ Anxiety,First week I took 5mg a day and it helped me get to sleep a lot faster. Since then I've taken 10mg a day - my insomnia is back_ libido is shot_ I have difficulty reaching orgasm_ and often the orgasms are duds.,I still have my blue days like every one else_ but Lexapro has helped me to sustain a content mood for most of the time. It has prevented my anxiety from escalating to panic attacks in tough times. I plan to seek help for the sexual side effects.,F,21,1.5  years,3/11/2007,Lexapro

She lowered my dose back down to 5mg and added trazodone_ which has helped a lot.,F,22,3  months,3/9/2007,Lexapro
1537, 5, Depression_ GAD,loss of sexual drive_ loss of appetiteboth disappeared over time,lexapro helped me a great deal. i only recently stopped taking it_ as i had been on it a very long time and its effectiveness wore off. in my opinion_ the minor side effects experienced during the first months of treatment were more than worth the eventual total relief of symptoms. i was switched to cymbalta today.,M,15,3  years,3/7/2007,Lexapro

I'm now at the month mark taking this med. It seems to be helping but improvement seems quite subtle at this point. I may increase to 20mg and see if I notice a more profound difference.

I tried going up to 3.? and after 3 days felt like I couldn't stop moving_ but was hard to focus so I did things like wash my kitchen floor etc.  I called my dr. office they told me to drop it down to 2.5 until they could see me.

I am now a completely different person.

1546, 3, Depression/Anxiety,Diarrhea_ drowziness_ lack of appetite_ nausea_ upset stomach,I've only been taking Lexapro for 2 day now_ but I can see a change already. The first night I took it right before bed. It took a little longer to fall asleep than I expected_ but once I did I slept much heavier than usual. I woke up about 3:30 am with some pretty intense diarrhea and nausea_ but after that subsided I was able to fall back asleep. I woke up the next morning feeling VERY rested and generally in better spirits than I usually am. I have not been able to eat much food since I started taking the drug_ but this coulb be a good thing since I recently gained 15 lbs due to depression. The side effects aren't anything that I can't handle_ and I'm sure they'll go away within the next week or so.,F,17,2  days,3/3/2007,Lexapro
1547, 3, General Anxiety,Weight gain_ headaches_ vivid dreams_ night sweats_ NO sexual desire,Taking 10 mg daily for the past 10 months did help with my general anxiety but the side effects are not worth it!  After having very odd dreams I would wake up covered in sweat and the headaches were unbearable at times.  I know weight gain is a common side effect but it only made me feel depressed as well as having NO sex drive.  My fiance was very patient but I feel like it hurt our relationship. I talked to my doctor and he put me on inderal (typically a blood pressure medication but in small doses is great for anxiety).  So far no problems and the weight has decreased slightly.,F,27,10  months,3/2/2007,Lexapro
1548, 5, General Anxiety Disorder/Depression,The first 2 weeks I was very sleepy_ yawning all of the time_ a little dizzy_ foggy headed and forgetful.  I have been a jaw-clencher in the past and noticed that I started doing that again.  At first it was a little hard to get motivated to get things done at home.  I also had a decrease in my sex drive.  No weight gain_ though.  I actually lost 2 pounds.,The first week I took 5 mg_ then 10 mg after that.  I saw the doctor today for my follow-up and am increasing to 15 mg.  This drug has worked great for me.  I haven't felt nearly as stressed as I used to.  I also noticed that it worked for my OCD.  I don't worry about everthing anymore and I'm not nearly as short-tempered as I was.  I feel more clear headed and mellowed out. I didn't really have any side effects that didn't go away after the first 2 weeks except maybe a little sleepiness and the dip in my sex drive.  It's just as well_ though.

1549, 5, ,A bit of euphoria in the beginning. Some jaw clenching. After the first couple of weeks all went away.,This drug is great.  My Mom suggested it as she has also had a good experience taking it.  I had gotten to the point where if someone was chewing gum i wanted to strangle them with it_ and even the noise of my flip flops against my feet was annoying me.  Since I am a flight attendant this was not a good thing.  With the help of lexapro_ I am now much better prepared to deal with the public on a daily basis.  Things are much less annoying.,F,39,8  months,3/1/2007,Lexapro

All the side effects that I described always go away (for me)in the first week or two_ however I don't remember being so hungry the last time I was on the medication although I did gain weight.

I took this for two months_ hoping that the side effects would ease.  Most had except for the apathy and fatigue - just wouldn't go away.  Doctors did not tell me that I needed to increase my Thyroid medicine as recommended by the manufacturer of the thyroid medicine.  I became more tired_ cold and weak after about 6 weeks so I had to discontinue.  The withdrawal process has been very difficult.  It apparently doesn't take a long time for this medicine to build up toxic levels in your blood and liver as well as affecting your brain.  Even though I tapered down in 1/4 pill increments_ the worst withdrawal symptoms happened to me after I completely stopped.  Dizziness_ headaches_ neck pain as well as muscle stiffness throughout the body are main complaints.  Why is this product legal?,M,55,84  days,2/19/2007Email,Lexapro

I am going to try dropping back to 10mg to see if the sexual side effect problems will go away.  Luckily I still have my libido - but I would like to have orgasms too. In general though I feel much better and more stable and more happy on Lexapro.  I do not feel numbed or drugged or unnatural. I have stopped fretting and over analyzing every little problem or issue.  I feel happy and normal.  I feel like I can really relax and enjoy my life_ maybe for the first time.

Not a strong depression but no something to not address. Took 5mg for 3 days and now have been on 10 mg for 2. Same sides as last time but already a vast improvement in the depression. Something to keep in mind for those reading forums like these hoping to find answers. Every one is different. There is the possibility that the intial kicking in of the medication will make you feel worse or more uneasy. Don't quit so easy. It is a rare few who seem to feel no side effects when starting these type of medications. Most effects go away within weeks...except the sexual ones and even those tend to,M,37,1  years,1/3/2007,Lexapro

1628, 4, anxiety,none_ so far,and I usually really do lose weight when I eat less and do more.  Bottom line is that if your depression has made it impossible to get a decent night of sleep and you take a medication that allows you to sleep a good_ restful 6-9 hours and you don't do anything else different_ you probably will gain some weight.  If you've been a zombie_ sleeping all night_ and most of the day too_ and you start a medication that acutally motivates you to GET OUT OF YOUR BED and move_ interact_ live life you may just lose a bit of weight even if you eat the exact same amount simply because you are no longer 99% sedentary.  Don't get me wrong_ I just came off Effexor witch_ although great with my anxiety_ just had too many other unpleasent issues.

The only problem I had was the insomnia. Kept waking up throughout the night and getting about 5 hours of sleep. The third day I noticed I was dizzy_ maybe because I had not had enough rest and I got concerned and called the nurse. She said everything would be OK and subside.  After that day the good feeling wore off_ and I was feeling fatigue with no zest for life. That day_ day four when I took the medication_ I started to notice a little bit of anxiety. Then it escalated really bad on the seventh day I was taking the medication and I could not get any sleep at all. Only one hour of sleep. Kept waking up with my heart pounding out of my chest. That's when I went to my doctor today and he switched me over to Wellbutrin. I want this medication to work so bad. Scared of the side effects. Not very pleasant with this one (Lexapro).

It was the heart palpitations that really got to me.  I thought I was having a heart attack.  So I was backed down to 5 mg. and now I realize that the nearly constant headaches I have had for the past 3 or 4 weeks are probably due to the Lexapro.  I thought they were just alergies or something.  I've also had a sinus infection and what my doctor thought was an ear infection_ but the dizziness and headaches were probably just a Lexapro side effect.The headaches are getting worse and now I'm probably going to have to try something else.,,F,40,6  months,11/9/2006,Lexapro

Switched to Lexapro and the plus is that I'm able to sleep very well_ but really miss the strong positive mood effect of Effexor.

I'm on 10mg at night (which does make me sleep well). I do feel calmer and my mind seems to be quieter but not convinced it is the drug instead of finally getting over a long illness. My appetite is constant and I'm putting on the pounds even though I'm now walking 5 days a week! Definitely not normal for me. Jaw clenching is very unwelcome as I hate the dentist! I wake myself up at night it's clenched so hard. Plus_ the inability to orgasm is more frustrating then the anxiety.

I didnt tell him I was taking Lexapro.  Always_ always sleepy.  I would just savor the moment I could curl into bed.  I would nap throughout the day 5 days out of 7.  Before Lexapro_ I would take a nap maybe twice a year.,"The benefits started to wear off and I found myself becoming overwhelmed by the ""small stuff"" again.  But instead of upping from 10mg. I decided to try the ""tomcruise"" method of exercising my troubles away...not really_ Im just not willing to put up with the side effects anymore.  My teeth were always sore.

It didn't help with the obsessive thoughts at all_ and made me feel like I just didn't care what happened and just didn't feel like myself... I believe it's called ""depersonalization.""  I also didn't want to be around other people and wanted to stay home all the time.  The kicker was that I couldn't have an orgasm!  That's when I knew I had to stop taking it.

Mentally_ I knew I should be more upset than I was (as I work abroad and had just gotten a Visa in that passport) but I just felt OK with the fact that it was gone. It was an odd sensation. Otherwise_ the insomnia was annoying and I now notice a tightness in my jaw and frequent jaw clenching. Increase in appetite. Otherwise_ no side effects and I have been generally happy with the results.

I am able to sleep at night and handle stressful situations objectivly and calmly.  I do feel that it put sort of a low ceiling on being very excited but very worth it.

I had shocks in my brain if I moved from side to side. Shaking_ sweating_ extreme fatigue. And I was led to believe it 'was just me'.,Lexapro worked great for my anxiety. Still does.

Intense paranoia.  No interest in sex at all.,Having gone through this before with Zoloft_ I was hoping to avoid it with Lexapro.  unfortunately this was not the case. I can not say with 100% certainty that some of these symptoms were not depression induced rather than side effects of the medication. I can say that after about 6 weeks_ everything corrected and I feel great now.  The only persistent side effect is lack of sex drive_ but compared to the mental side effects I can deal with it.  I must say that I wonder if seratonin imbalance was truly the problem as my symptoms (side effects) kind of resembled hyper-seratonin.  Perhaps my problem was a dopamine issue and not seratonin?

Not at all unpleasant.  I'm on 10mg and feel much more steady overall.  My mind has settled down and I actually feel a bit sharper.  The sexual side-effects are really getting to me though.  I need to be on this stuff because I'm going through difficult times and serious high-stress/frustration at work_ but I'd love to get off.  Dr. said he might put me on 10 mg. of Celexa after I give this a try for another week or so.  For the first time in a long time I'm actually enjoying spending time with my wife and kids. Still_ the sexual side-effects are messing with me.,M,41,5  days,4/3/2006Email,Lexapro
1822, 3, General Anxiety Disorder,Some sexual dysfunction and was always hard to achieve orgasm_ Weight Loss_ Jaw Clenching,Lexapro had not done a damn thing about my anxiety. I still take things too personal when I know I shouldn't. I have had periods of good manic hyperactivity (which was lots of fun!)_ Alot of my irritibility was virtually gone and it's hard for me to get angry (which was really bad). I will keep taking this drug for as long as it's efficacy doesn't run out_ because being a pizza delivery driver_ driving with alot of utah morons (not mormons)_ and the cheap stiffs gets VERY stressful.,M,21,2  months,4/3/2006,Lexapro

1824, 4, Depression,Fatigue for a week or so.,"Prior to Lexapro I was on prozac for a couple years.  I didn't get the initial ""high"" I experienced on Prozac or the hyperness.  (Neither drug caused a loss of libido).  But it does work to keep me balanced and I am on lowest dose.  The problem with the Prozac is that I needed to keep increasing the dose_ so after about 6 months on Prozac it wasn't working as well.  I increased the dose but after two years it was obvious I would need to increase again.  So far it has been almost a year on Lexapro and no problems.  It does the job and I haven't needed an increase.",F,28,1  years,3/31/2006,Lexapro
1825, 5, Depression/Anxiety,The first week_ I was extremely tired. Also noticed that my pupils were dilated in the morning when I would get up. I also take an antihistamine daily_ so perhaps the pupil dilation and sedating effects were from the combination of the two. Had some dizziness the first week. The second week the tiredness went away_ but now I frequently have sweaty palms_ and had headaches most of that week.,The medication has definitely helped with both depression and anxiety. I am no longer crying at the slightest provocation_ not obsessing about things_ and not anxious. I feel like I used to feel on a good day-not unaware that there are issues that I need to resolve_ but feeling capable that I can resolve them. More interested in getting out and doing things and interacting with people. House is clean_ work gets finished_ I sleep at night instead of worrying. My doctor had told me about the possible side effects and that for many people_ these resolve after a few weeks. My side efects do seem to be going away_ except for the sweaty palms. However_ I'll take the sweaty palms over how I was feeling before any day of the week. Should have started on medication like this years ago!,F,40,17  days,3/26/2006,Lexapro
1826, 2, Depression,EXTREME night sweats!  Wake up drenched in a cold sweat nightly. Often have to change clothing in the middle of night and put a towel down on the sheet because it's SOAKED.  Very gross and stinky.  Wake-up dying of thirst and I drink at least 5 bottles of water a day.  At first I thought perimenopause - I'm 42_ so it seemed plausible.  Also_ ability to acheive orgasm difficult in ADDITION to loss of libido. Can't believe I didn't research this sooner.  Going back to Wellbutrin XL...,Been trying to find an alternative to Prozac for years due to difficulty in acheiving orgasm. Tried Wellbutrin XL but found I still had to take 10 mg Prozac otherwise was still depressed.  Tried Lexapro on friends recommendation - said she had no sexual side effects.  Going back to Wellbutrin & Prozac.  Can't wait to get a good night's sleep without the sweating!  It's been awful....,F,42,4  months,3/26/2006,Lexapro

I had horrible headaches_ which is not a common thing for me.  About 5days into it_ I got like a sinus infection/cold...i don't know but i was sick.  Told my doctor and he switched me to wellbutrin.  He said lexapro does cause increased risk of upper respiratory infection. My headaches were so bad I wanted to stick something up my nose to scratch my brain.

I told my doctor and she suggested combining lexapro with wellbutrin to counteract it_ and I think I may take her up on it. My sex drive seems to be coming back_ but orgasms are harder to reach and not as intense.,Overall_ I love lexapro. On the fourth night_ I noticed my thoughts were flowing through me and I was not fixating on things. Before the medicine_ I was completely fixated on what went wrong in my last relationship and it's just completely lost the grip it had on me. I feel less inhibited_ less affected by others.

I take it at night b/c of night anxiety and it has helped so much.  Within the first week i was happy_ giggly and bubbly.  I'm an outgoing person anyways_ but this helped my anxiety even more.  PTSD stems from fear of death and it's helped with that as well.  No more night anxiety attacks.

He immediately took me off the Lexapro and thought it was related.,I learned a big lesson on this.  You read that any of these antidepressants have this capability_ but it never happened to me.

Went to 15mg-nothing_ 20mg-some effect on depression_ now on 25mg and depression is almost gone. Thinking about going to 30mg since I have OCD_ which requires higher dosages.

I felt worse on it than I had before starting. I always felt drunk and my pupils were huge. My vision was blurry and my head hurt almost all the time. I had trouble sleeping & staying asleep even though I was always tired. I would wake up with huge_ deep bruises all over my legs and arms where no trauma had occurred. The worst for me was the TREMORS. After about a week_ I noticed the my right hand shook constantly and visibly. By the end of the second week_ I experienced frightening episode of full-body tremors -- I was shaking all over and could not stop. It was like cold chills without being cold and it was terrifying. According to the manufacturer_ this is a rare side effect_ but I know of three other women who have had the same experience. I got off of Lexapro immediately and began feeling better within 24 hrs.,F,36,2  weeks,2/19/2006,Lexapro

Not sure I was really clinically depressed_ but sure was anxious...the slightest issue could manifest itself in negative ways in my mind.  I went on Lexapro (only 5 mg) reluctantly and I have to say it was a great decision.  Its taken the edge off just enough to help me deal with things a bit more practically.  I was very concerned about sexual side effects...so far its a good and bad scenario...I've had NO libido issues_ in fact I think I'm more frisky than before and erection quality is amazing_ but I do think I'm experiencing delayed ejaculation...it takes me a very long time to ""get there"".",M,44,4  weeks,2/17/2006,Lexapro

I am rarely ever anxious anymore and have not had a panic attack in 2 years. I am more even-tempered_ social_ and generally happy. My sex-drive returned after about 6 months_ and the only other residual side effect have been weight gain(25lbs) and sweating. I know the break-in period can be bad for some people and my only advice is to stick it out because the results are well worth it!,M,34,2  years,2/16/2006,Lexapro
1852, 3, Depression/Social Anxiety,This drug zapped my energy big time.  For the past month I've been incredibly lazy and all I wanted to do was sleep.  Every single night while taking it I've had detailed_ memorable dreams.  Also I don't really think I gained weight but my appetite was increased some.  On the first day I had a raging headache and I felt like I was living in a cloud but after that I was fine.   No other side effects that I can think of.,I read a lot about problems with withdrawal after stopping Lexapro_ but I stopped taking it after 4 weeks with no tapering or anything and I was fine.  No withdrawal symptoms at all.  As far as benefits go_ it's hard for me to tell whether it worked or not.  I had started taking it because I had become withdrawn almost to the point of being anti-social.  If that improved at all with the Lexapro_ it was countered by the fact that all I ever wanted to do was sleep.  So overall I don't think this drug worked for me.  I'm trying Wellbutrin now to see if it works without zapping my energy.,F,25,4  weeks,2/15/2006,Lexapro

1870, 1, anxiety,Zero sex drive_ inability to orgasm_ no appetite_ and depression,My doctor prescribed it for generalized anxiety and it worked well at first. Then_ I suddenly and bizarrely fell into a severe depressive spiral with obsessive thoughts of suicide. There was no joy in my life and I felt like crying all the time. I'm starting Wellbutrin tomorrow and hoping I'm able to enjoy life again.,F,38,2  months,1/3/2006,Lexapro
1871, 4, Depression & anxiety,No sex drive anymore and teeth clenching nightly & weight gain,Three yrs. ago_ our son got full custody of his now 6 yr. old son.  We take care of our precious Grandson full time and he has many health issues.  2 1/2 yrs. ago_ my sweet Mom moved in with us and she has dimentia. With sleepless nights and much stress_ I got on 10 mg. of Lexapro at night and sleep better and don't cry at the drop of a hat anymore.  I don't know if it's addictive but I really see no need to get off it.  My husband of 32 yrs._ has lost his job of 21 yrs. and he's now on meds for anxiety. (Not Lexapro but Zoloft))  He wants to get off them just after 6 weeks as he's feeling even more anxsious than before he got on them.  Lexapro seems to help me stay calm enough to help him with positive thoughts_ most of the time.  I want him to feel better soon and with God's help_ he will!,F,57,2  years,1/1/2006,Lexapro
1872, 1, Anxiety,While on the drug - extreme sleepiness (slept an avarage of 13 hours a night while I was on it)_ inability to wake up in the morning_ always wanting to just be in bed; feeling unmotivated; vivid nightmares; irritability; violent thoughts. While getting off it (quit cold turkey) - deep depression with suicidal thoughts for 5 days,THE ABSOLUTE WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. I would not recommend this drug to anyone! It didn't help my anxiety at all while I was on it_ and had terrible side effects. After two weeks_ my doctor wanted to switch me to Effexor since Lexapro wasn't working_ so I quit cold turkey_ and had the worst five days of my life (extreme depressive state) which unfortunately_ I had not been warned about by my doctor. I flushed all the drugs down the toilet and would never try another antidepressant again - so not worth it.,F,24,15  days,12/30/2005,Lexapro

I experienced diarrhea_ mild nausea_ frequent urination_ and patchy loss of body hair.,Every person is different_ and if someone gets the sleep benefit without the unpleasant side effects_ great_ but for me the bad outweighed the good.  I understand that lots of women experience loss of hair (on their heads_ that is) with Lexapro_ but I'd be interested to hear if other men experienced body hair loss as I did.,M,48,2  months,12/28/2005Email,Lexapro

1876, 4, depression and social anxiety,incredible drowsiness - napping many times a day for extended periods_ night sweating,Lexapro has been great as far as balancing out my mood_ and making me feel much less anxious and happy overall.  However_ the drowsiness is becoming a pretty big problem_ especially when I am sleeping an average of 12 hours a day (mostly in 4-5 hour naps).  Night sweating happens about twice a week_ and is a pretty small side effect.,F,20,3  months,12/26/2005,Lexapro
1877, 3, Anxiety,Basically_ the main side effect for me is constant_ and I mean CONSTANT teeth clenching.  So much so_ that my jaws ache.,I do feel less worry and anxiety.  I do feel more care free_ but this worries me a little bit due to the fact that I am not so compulsively concerned with things.  Its weird..I'm worried that I dont worry about things anymore..(does that make sense?),M,45,6  months,12/24/2005,Lexapro
1878, 3, Depression/Cyclothimia,NO SEX DRIVE_ Weight Gain (20+ lbs)_ increased appetite_ excessive sleepiness_ lack of energy,I started this drug in May 2005 taking 10mg and was increased to 20mg in Aug 2005. (I stopped briefly in Feb-April 2005.... cold turkey withdrawal was horrible. I was hallucinating. I then started to take reduced doses to ween off and it wasnt too bad) I gained about 10 lbs the first 6 months on the drug and since the doubling of the dosage I have gained a hefty 10 more (NOT COOL! I am only 5'2 and I am weighing 145 lbs!) After being a very sexual person_ I became dry as the sahara. I can fall asleep @ any time_ anywhere! I have no energy to go to the gym or work out or do anything. I do like the fact that I am no longer depressed_ I am nicer to people and I feel better. However_ this medication has not helped much with my mood swings. I am still edgy as ever. I keep on packing the pounds and have no desire to exercise or have sex. I am starting Wellbutrin today and I hope that goes well. I need to lose weight_ need the energy to go to the gym and I NEED to get my libido back b/c my re,F,23,20  months,12/22/2005,Lexapro

1880, 1, depression and anxiety,I was just depressed. When I started taking lexapro_ I had the symptoms of bipolar. Half of the day feeling so good like I took cocaine_ having inability to concentrate and study; the rest of the day feeling suicidal.,The only thing which was not so terrible for me about this drug as I wouldn't say about the other pshychotic drugs is that I didn't have any withdrawals after stopping taking it. The only thing everyone suffering from depression should know befor taking any antidepressant is that if you start taking this drug it doesn't completely mean that your depression_ suicidal thoughts and anxiety will go away_ in many cases it comes back or even worsens while taking a drug.,F,20,7  days,12/21/2005,Lexapro
1881, 5, depression,weight gain...but so worth it,I have been on Lexapro for a while and my doctor took me off and switched me to Wellbutrin because I had gained 18 pounds in 2 months. BIG MISTAKE. I felt alive and clearheaded with Lexapro. I felt like a normal person. I even kept a clean house. With my depression everything stays jumbled up in my head and Lexapro helps me sort it all out. I LOVE LEXAPRO. Wellbutrin is making me mean_ angry_ nervous_ anxious_ suicidal_ homisidal. I HATE WELLBUTRIN,F,30,2  months,12/19/2005,Lexapro
1882, 4, PMDD,No sex drive_ inability to orgasm_ weight gain,My doctor prescribed it for my PMS anger issues. Lexapro really helped me with my anger_ made me very calm_ and made me alot more laid back and less anxious.  The best way I can describe the effect of lexapro is that it makes me feel safe_ relaxed and secure whereas without it_ I felt anxious and worried. It made me very positive and happy with the ability to look on the bright side.  Also_ it helped me with my career by giving me alot of confidence and helped me in thinking clearly.  I think this is a great medicine if you are trying to control your anger and if you want to feel peaceful/calm.  However_ the lack of sex drive bothers me as I took it as a newly wed and that kind of deprived us. Now I have gone down to Lexapro 5 mg a day (still works great at that dose) + welbutrin XL 150 mg (only on it for 5 days).  Wellbutrin cuts my appetite which is good b/c my doctor said that Lexapro would increase my appetite_ which it did.  I've lost 2 lbs in 5 days.

1884, 3, Depression & Anxiety,Constant fatigue_ zero libido_ dull headaches_ facial sweating_ mild nausea_ diarrhea_ insomnia.,I tried Lexapro for 2 months before switching to Wellbutrin XL. Lexapro eased my anxiety_ but made me feel emotionally detached. It has a sedating_ dampening effect_ whereas Wellbutrin has more of an energizing_ enhancing effect for me. Everyone reacts differently to antidepressants_ and youll never know which one is right for you until you try. If your core issue is anxiety (which causes your depression)_ then youll probably do well with an SSRI like Lexapro. But if youre like me and your core issue is depression (which makes you anxious)_ you might prefer a more stimulating medication like Wellbutrin. And many people have success with a combination of the two.,M,34,2  months,12/10/2005,Lexapro

It does the job in terms of my depression and anxiety_ but it has a load of side effects.  While I think some may go away_ I also think we just get used to them over time.The weight gain is real_ no matter what the ""official clinical trials"" report.  Nearly everyone complains about it.  I've been thin all my life and it's very hard to deal with_ because I don't think that increasing my activity level is going to counteract it.The dreams are very disturbing.  I often get confused about whether I dreamt something...or whether I'm remembering a real event.  Scary.I'm worried about long-term problems I may not be able to deal with in a year or so.
