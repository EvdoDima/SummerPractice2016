2, 5, Genital warts,Burns like hell and gets worse every application. HORRIBLE odor like you couldn't imagine_ itches,Wear maxi pads and change them often. When you feel itchy or wet kinda like you're sweating be sure to make it to a restroom_ change_ and pat dry. It's awful but it works!! Mine were pretty far spread and I have one cluster right in my anus that's taking the longest,F,25,5  days,3/1/2016,Condylox
3, 5, Genital warts- external labia,None.  Mild tingle maybe.  No pain,I applied pretty liberally to a small cluster and a couple small strays. By the end of the treatment cycle (3 days/twice a day) they were gone.  Used a vagisil cream on interior labia only to protect it just in case.  They turn white with application_ and then just kind of shrivel off and fall off. I think the last one I kinda plucked off.  Now 2 mths later_ they're back so now on day 1 of another cycle.  Allowed maybe a minute of dry time. Completely painless_ no odor.  Nothing- just gone,F,37,1  daysSolution,2/21/2016Email,Condylox
4, 4, Condylox,Like everyone else -- first time I was generous with the application and suffered for it. Warts/skin begin to rot_ burn and bleed. The warts (or what I think are warts) turn black and usually fall off when I'm scrubbing in the shower. (Not sure if I should even be scrubbing the area or if I should just leave it alone_ actually.) I'm currently on my second round of using it--three months later first case--as more have appeared.,A few people mentioned having used it multiple times. I'm interested in hearing peoples' experience with reoccurring breakouts. I'm on my second in a span of three months.Quick backstory: Not sure where I got it. My ex and I we were together 9 months (stopped using condoms after a couple weeks) and were both orally-inclined. If she or I had any visible warts_ we definitely would have noticed. We broke up in September. Guess who pops up in October when I'm ready to jump back in the dating game? Four lil homies at the base of my penis. Went to the doctor in October and got condylox. I used it and it cleared up. Notified my ex about it--she's got an appointment with her OBGYN coming soon. (Should have told her when I first noticed them and maybe I wouldn't have burned the hell out of my penis applying this stuff incorrectly the first time.)It's early January now. Guess who's back? Three more lil homies.How many of you using this product have experienced reoccurring warts? Are any other products better than condylox? Has anyone gone a solid year without another outbreak? And_ I realize this isn't a forum_ how do you disclose it to past/current/future partners? Please message me and share here if you have any insights.Thanks for reading_ and may you never see these little fuckers again!,M,32,  2X D,1/6/2016Email,Condylox
5, 3, GW,None.,So I am on day 3_ of application and reading all the comments. I have experienced none of the side effects of what's being posted right now_ which is scarier to me then the side effects. Its a liquid in a very tiny bottle and comes with the qtips. I have been very liberal with application and I came to this side because I was worried that it was not working. I would expect some burn or tenderness because it was described as an acid_ but to get nothing scares me. If anyone has had a similar experience please contact me.,M,23,3  days 2X D,11/27/2015Email,Condylox
6, 3, hvp bumbs,So much pain!,It didn't hurt the days I was applying it...a little burning but nothing I couldn't handle. I only used it for 2 days because my warts turned white and it was becoming painful. As the days went on it became more and more painful. I didn't know about letting it dry..so I think it spread all over. I have spots where the gel ate through my skin. this has been the most painful experience of my life. It hurt to walk_ sit_ move. It was unbearable. The only relief I found was taking a bath and that was only temporary. The pain has eased a little since. Its been 8 days now since I used the gel and my wounds have not healed yet. Its so uncomfortable and burns when I pee and so painful to wipe. As far as I can tell my warts fell off_ but the area is so swollen and covered with open sores_ it's kinda hard to tell for sure. I will never use this again. The pain is unimaginable.,F,27,2  days,11/7/2015Email,Condylox
7, 5, Treatment of GW,So I'm now on my second round. Your supposed to do 3 days on (2 treatments a day) and 4 days of. Repeat up to 4 times. So 2 treatments a day would be 6 doses. Well after the 2nd dose it started getting more and more unbearable_ so I only got through 5 doses. It was excruciating. The pain_ itching_ stinging. I had to use frozen bags of edamame to ice down there. I thought I would never do it again. But once I saw the results that was another story. It worked amazingly_ and I had a lot of both vaginal and anal warts. So there were like two spots that looked gone but questionable_ so I decided since it was such a small surface area_ I could bear one more treatment. On day two of that.,Use a hand mirror. Don't use too much. Make sure you let it dry!! Oh and I found it helpful to tuck folded toilet paper between my labia and butt where I was treating. It'll start to kinda leak fluid/ puss and it'll itch like crazy if the area is rubbing other skin. Call off of work. The pain is worth the results if you can bear it.,F,29,3  days.5%,11/2/2015,Condylox
8, 4, HPV (SEVERE_ 2 HIGH RISK STRANDS),Burning_ swelling_ flu like symptoms_ nausea_ and tremendous pain.,"After switching doctor after doctor due to the fact they would not help me with my condition_ I have a terrible case of HPV. My current doctor even described it as the ""worst she has ever seen"". Please take note that my review is for those who are suffering the same hurdles I am when it comes to this virus. I administered this to two large wart sites and by god it burns like a heffer. I had crazy side effects and even had to take Narco to go to bed last night. However_ it is noted that you should only take this in small quantities and I was using it in two large areas so this could be why the side effects were so severe. I can barely walk due to the yeast infection this has given me and has caused swelling. I just picked up Monostat today to use. Although_ despite it's torture_ I can say it has successfully killed my two large wart sites (they have not ""sloughed"" off yet_ but they are whiter than white) and a few have been removed from my body and this is only on day five. Both wart sites are painful; however_ Neosporin 24 hour infection protection and pain relief has been helping with both sites. I will be waiting a while before I use the second treatment so I can fully recover since I did attack the two largest sites I have and now all I have to tackle is the little ones. This is no joke_ but it gets the job done and if you are like me_ where the warts are so bad they place you in discomfort on a day to day basis_ this is the gel for you.",F,22,5  days0.5% 2X D,9/21/2015,Condylox

Anyway i have one dime sized wart by rectum. I am 2 doses down with 1 coming tonight. Trying my best to keep it off healthy skin. The wart turned white. Now it hurts like nothing I've ever felt. Hurts_ sitting_ standing_ laying down_ heck it hurts in every possible position. I'm really tempted to just put duct tape on both my cheeks so they don't have to rub on each other.

16, 4, Anal Warts HPV,Burning_ white flaky skin_ some bleeding_ odor,Saw 2 pimple-looking bumps around my rectum and didn't think anything of it for a couple of weeks. Went to the doctor and was told I had warts_ take the cream_ and basically move on with my life as though it was no big deal. Would love it if they never come back. As others have said_ only apply this stuff to the warts. It will burn like crazy. I just finished the 3 days of treatment_ and it sounds like I am in for a painful few days judging by what I'm reading from others. Bottom line: it is SO easy to get HPV_ especially around your anus.

17, 4, GW,"I was diagnosed with GW Tuesday last week. Had them for about a month before I could actually be seen by a doctor. I figured I had it after researching in my agonizing time waiting to be seen.  Once diagnosed I was given the ""4 out of 5 people have this its common"" speech. needless to say I'm bitter_ and I want these disgusting things to go away and never cone back. I was prescribed condylox_prodoylox comes in a tiny bottle with little q-tips for application. I had clusters of tiny warts maybe 8-10 pet side on the bottom of my vagina and then small individual warts around my anus.  My fiance applied the medicine to my warts for me twice a day for three days. I'm on my first rest day. My clusters are gone no warts.  I have 4 large warts still holding on. Where the clusters were are now huge open wounds. Has this happened to anyone else? It is so painful and I have a very high tolerance.  It is a large chemical burn and its right where my butt cheeks touch so there is no way to really keep it from rubbing.  Anyone have some advice? Love some direction here.  The pain is crucial and the skin looks like I was mauled by an animal.  I'm satisfied the warts are gone but I cannot be overjoyed about the way my vagina looks plus I'm getting married in 2 months.

21, 5, genital warts,Burning and bleeding.,Females listen up!! Second week on medication. You absolutely need someone to apply it to areas you can not reach_ or areas that need to be held open to DRY! If you have them on your rectum...You will need monostat_ clean wipes_ and panty liners. Hold area open and apply ONLY to warts. Keep area open to air dry at least a full minute or you get it on skin that doesn't need it.That skin will die!A fan helps a lot! They do start to come off after the first week_ usually when you wipe and it does hurt. You can get skin tears. If you do and it is on your rectal area_ you must keep it clean and dry or you will get a yeast infection there. The areas weep and cause wetness. A yeast infection has a noticeable odor and the area turns white. Here is what I did. Cleaned area three times a day and applied monostat. The areas were bleeding and weeping so I used a panty liner. Peel off the back and fold it in half . Put it in between the buttocks to keep the area dry at all times. You may need to change it a few times a day till the area heals enough to stop doing it. Yes it is uncomfortable. BUT please listen to me and this will get you through it. I am on my second week. All 7 of my vaginal warts fell off the first week. 5 of my rectal warts fell off as well. You can do this!!! Remember that once they are gone you still have the virus and you can get more warts...and spread it to your partner. The quickest way to know if the virus is gone is a pap smear.

It kept growing and I noticed small clusters of bumps under the folds of my vaginal lips. I was freaking out! I went to the doctor and as soon as she saw them she knew it was gw/aw. Right away she prescribed condylox. I read the application instructions but and applied it just to my warts but didn't let it dry. HUGE MISTAKE. It burned like no other and after a day my skin became white and tender to the touch. I only applied it 2xs a day for 3 days and after the 3rd day the warts under my vaginal lips were where white. I used a warm wash cloth and gently wiped them down an the warts fell off!!!! By the seconds days rest I started to notice the warts around my anus slowly go away and the large ""growth"" cluster of warts was virtually gone! I'm on my last rest day and ALL MY WARTS ARE GONE!! No scars marks or any proof they were even there. I have been so depressed because of this and felt my sexual life was over but condylox changed that.

27, 5, Genital warts,Slight irritation around site of wart. For very small warts_ this is very common since it is almost impossible to apply and not get any on healthy skin.,This is basically for the guys out there who have penile warts. I have used it on 4 separate occasions and each time it works like a breeze. You barely have to use any - just enough to get a thin coating on the wart. After 3 days you may notice a difference or you may not notice much of anything and think it is not working. Stick with the instructions and take the 4 days off. Each time I used it_ I noticed nothing until the 4th and 5th days_ when the skin/wart began flaking away and basically falling off. I've never needed to use more than one treatment week on a wart. 3 days_ morning and night (and you can be pretty relaxed on the time) and you'll likely be all through with it. Don't stress if you get a tiny bit on healthy skin. It does take a bit to dry. I give it at least 15 minutes just to be sure. **Feel free to email me of you have any questions.**,M,40,5  days1 2X D,5/14/2013Email,Condylox
28, 5, Genital Warts (gw),For the people that said burning burning burning... that is 100% correct. The first application burned_ but not as bad as later applications. The second application burned as well. I think it's better to bathe or shower first_ dry first_ and then apply the gel. Allow the gel to fully dry!  Do not close your legs or walk! The best is to sit with your back on the wall_ lay on the floor_ or lay on the bed and apply with mirror. I fanned it with a paper_ but some people use the cool setting on a hair dryer. If you are active with sports_ jobs_ etc.  You should do what I did and start on Thursday of Friday_ & do your 3 days wen you can relax. The second day of treatment for me was yesterday_ the pain was unbearable_ walking_ shitting (moves those muscles where the warts were). Also_ pee contains uric acid_ it burns the treated area very badly_ enough to make you shout!  It was so painful_ I decided to take a hot bath_ and soak_ I lightly scrubbed the area_  and ran warm/hot water on it.,I had felt a tiny little bumpy cluster at the bottom of my vaginal opening_ like right at the bottom. I have vaginal tears there after sex_ so I just thought the skin healed weird_ but I am a biology student_ so I knew it could also be gw. I went to the doctor_ she looked and immediately said it was gw. I cried_ I was devistated. She asked me if I wanted to treat and I said yes_ so she prescribed the gel. You are supposed to do twice a day_ once at morning_ and once at night. You can also use it while on your period. I took a shower_ and took my first dose at night. It took 3 seconds_ and then all of a sudden hurt immediately! Like imagine when you take a shot of tequila_ and the shock sensation afterward!! You want to use a good light (desk lamp maybe) and a small mirror_ magnifying is even better. I didn't use the precision tip_ I put the gel on qtips_ and applied with those.

30, 5, Genital Warts,When I first went to the doctor_ I was scared. I wanted these warts gone. I was prescribed Condylox per his request. I doused my penis in the gel and to my horror_ it burned while at work and burned for quite a while_ removing the majority of my genital warts but also the majority of my skin on my penis-head where the genital warts were. I could not handle this. So I stopped taking condylox_ this was a year ago almost precisely to the date. I then tried every other remedy I read about online_ although I was still smoking cigarettes. I stopped trying about 3 months later. Last week_ I went to the doctor again to try condylox_ since the warts had persisted. At this time_ I had quit cigarettes for about 2 weeks. I knew how to use the gel now and the results are amazing. Less is more_ guys! I have about 50+ warts_ flat and raised_ and they are dissapearing fast. The gel is basically an acid that eats away the warts and your skin. Be very_ very careful and as I said_ less is more. I still h,My best advice is to have a healthy diet_ raise your immune system_ quit cigarettes and alcohol and DO NOT PANIC. Use a nail file in order to allow the gel to enter the warts.

Tried to keep it off normal skin but difficult w location. I LITERALLY burned the first two layers of skin off a large area and have been couch/bed ridden for three days waiting to heal. Can't walk_ sit_ drive_ etc. if this happens to u don't panic. Get A and D ointment and Bactine cleansing spray w lidocaine (no sting kind). Take warm soapy bath three times a day to keep clean_ use Bactine 3x per day and A and D as often as u want. Bear down and pray.

35, 4, HPV,Very minor soreness_ no pain whatsoever.,I've been struggling with this condition for a few years now.  I've had multiple visits to the dermatologist for freezing (which has had limited results)_ and was prescribed Aldara which did absolutely nothing for me.  Condylox has so far been the most successful treatment.  I'm on week 3 now and my smaller warts have shrunk in half.  I have a cluster about the size of a penny on my waist line (which had previously been misdiagnosed by my doctor)_ and it's receding each week.  I don't feel I'll be completely rid of them by the end of 4 weeks so I may have to switch back to regular cryo/freezing visits to finish them off.  I've seen others' experiences stating that they were in a lot of pain but the treatment seemed to work very quickly for them.  I have absolutely no pain but my progress seems to be slower.  Maybe there's a correlation there.  Ultimately this treatment works for me but as I've learned_ the preferred treatment varies from person to person_ so don't be discouraged if your mileage varies.,M,33,3  weeks 2X D,10/17/2012,Condylox

I am laying in bed as I type this cringing from the burning_ stinging pain around my rectum. The whole area is red and raw and wiping after a bowel movement makes me want to cry. And passing gas. Never thought THAT could hurt. Anyways_ Because of the position of the warts around my anus_ its difficult to see well enough to apply only to the warts_ so a few times I have just taken a small amount and smeared it over the entire affected area. The only improvement I see so far is that some of the warts are getting a black spot so I hope that means they are necrotizing.

Skin is red_ but bumps are white and soft like they were left in the bathtub too long.It does seem to be working,This stuff works very well_ just be ULTRA CAREFUL to only apply to the wart or bump.Make sure you let it dry for a while before putting clothing on or doing anything that could spread this stuff around.,M,27,3  days 2X D,7/23/2012,Condylox
38, 4, Genital warts,Mostly burns once it is rinsed off after 4 hours. Wasn't to bad til my skin blistered. But well worth the pain!,I had done 5 treatments at the doctor and the warts were slowly going away. We decided to try condylox and I'm shocked. After the first cycle (3 days on_ 4 days off) my warts that I thought were impossible to get rid of are gone. Though I had gotten a huge blister around the cluster which is now almost gone as well. I'm on cycle number 2_ only see one small wart so I'm treating it.,F,22,  2X D,7/7/2012Email,Condylox

I missed 2 doses so I extended treatment to 4th day. On my first day of being off (5th day) I'm experiencing the worst pain. Some of the condylox got on good skin when my cheeks pressed together and ate surface away! Ouch! Haven't been able to have BM's very easily due to pain. Can't wait to see Dr in 2 days for check-up!

49, 4, Genital Wart,No side effects!,My wart completely fell off within the first application cycle!  I began using Condylox on Friday morning and I applied the medicine as directed  twice a day_ three times a day.  I woke up Wednesday morning and I noticed the skin around the wart tore.  I left it as is and that same evening_ around 7 p.m. used the bathroom and noticed the wart was complete gone.  What a relief!  Now I have to focus on getting rid of the HPV_ if I still have it.Despite the side effects of the medicine_ I didnt feel a thing.  I did notice the skin get darker and darker as Wednesday approached.  Its like watching paint dry.  Nevertheless_ no itching_ burning_ headaches_ none of that stuff.  Some people may experience side effects_ others dont.  If you dont feel anything going on down there_ that doesnt mean the medicine is not working.

I'm on day two of treatment_ mine is a large cluster of small warts so very hard to apply just to the affected area. The first time I applied I stood up quickly and it burned so bad I almost fell over_ but after reading these reviews I used some of the tips. Ladies (or men) the hair dryer really helps.

54, 4, HPV,burning/itching,"If you are not a male with a high pain tolerance I do not recommend this method of ""treatment"". After applying condylox for the last day i experienced scabs and pain. For the whole duration of application I applied the gel all over the base of my penis where the legions existed. The first and second day I experienced Immense pain. I headed to wallgreens and stocked up my operation cabinet and mentally prepared for immense pain (no painkillers whatsoever). I had picked the remaining scabs off the second day off the gel. I then poured rubbing alcohol (70%) all over the raw skin. CAUTION: THIS WILL BURN AND YOU WILL USE EXPLITIVES. the rubbing alcohol is to prevent any infection. I also used surgical gloves when dealing with the genitalia. It's not worth spreading the infection and doctors wear them when examining you for the disease so why not. After the rubbing alcohol i sprayed on neosporin with pain relief. After letting the neosporin dry somewhat I caked on vaseline. This keeps the neosporin in tact with the skin. Next i wrapped my whole penis in gaws (not the tip of the penis). So far this has made everyday movement possible. ONLY APPLY THE CONDYLOX GEL TO YOUR WARTS PRECISELY!!!! CONDYLOX IS AN ACID! The goal of condylox is to rott of the wart so if it comes in tact with healthy skin it will rott it away. Alcohol will be painful but it will keep your tender areas protected from infection.

I do not understand how ppl keep saying to not get this gel on healthy skin...  with extremely small warts it is impossible not to!  However the results seem to be worth the pain.  None are gone_ I wish they were but the ones that can be felt are noticably smaller.  How are women seeing them?  I don't understand lol I wish I can see down there to see what the heck is going on ne us girls are going in blind which also leads to this medicine going on to healthy areas of skin :/ ..  One thing I can suggest is not to use too much and dry with a hair dryer before and after application.

But then the 2nd and 3rd day OMG burning and a nasty smell_ its hard to walk_ get out of bed_ sit_ wip anything. So I'm on my first day of rest and I'm sprying Neosporin with pain all over and apply warm rags it makes it feel so much better. But I'm going to the doc Saturday just to get a week check up because the smell is REALLY bad.

60, 4, genital warts,slight burning_ skin irritation_ tiny open sores,Like everyone says: make sure you apply only to the warts and not to the healthy skin.  I accidentally bumped my healthy skin with the Q-tip around my anus and the next day I noticed it ate away at my skin and left a red open sore.  I also assumed the more cream I applied to a wart the better the condylox would work_ but all it did was cause the excess cream to spread onto my skin and cause irritation.  You really only need a small amount.  I had many warts surrounding my anus_ some of them were very large so I was skeptical that this would work for me.  I just finished my third day yesterday and they are already gone!  I was so excited because it's frustrating and embarrassing to have genital warts.  Now I'm experiencing some slight burning (nothing unbearable just a bit uncomfortable) and there are some open sores where the warts once were which I expect will turn to scabs during this 4 day period of rest.  I've been using Vaseline (as my doctor instructed) to help with the soreness and it really provides some comfort.  I would definitely recommend conylox; it's used in the privacy of your own home_ they experience is less painful then having them treated at the doctor_ and most important it works!

61, 5, Genital Warts,Burning_ itching_ minicule bleeding,I hate to comment on such a thing_ but I guess it's best if it helps others.  I had a cluster a little bigger than a dime on one side of my penis and a smaller one on the other.  I was so afraid to go to the doctor when I first saw small bumps there that I tried to ignore it for around a year and a half.  I abstained from sex which was hell_ but I didn't want anyone to have to go through it.  When I finally broke down and told a doctor he sent me to a urologist where I was burned repeatedly once every six weeks three times with severely strong wart remover before I asked due to the pain if there was anything else.  He prescribed condylox and I used it as prescribed.  It did burn and there was white flaking_ but I was applying it myself so no more embarrassment of laying on a doctors bed while he painted my privates with acid.  When I finally went back for the last time he checked with the solution that makes them visible and they were all gone_ finally.  About a week and a half later I noticed a small growth which I quickly applied the gel to as instructed_ and it went away as well.  It has been two years since that happened and I have not seen any warts reappear at all.  I still have a small amount of the gel left as well in case something does happen.  I still don't know if I'll ever be comfortable telling a woman that I have genital warts so I have to always use a condom_ but for peace of mind they are gone.  I do reccomend trying this because it beats the alternative.,M,27,4  weeks0.5% 2X D,3/26/2011Email,Condylox

The night after i had put on my last application was the worst_ kept waking up. It was my first rest day today and it is sore_ skins white and bleeding_ but it looks like its eaten through all the skin_ so at least the affected area has been eaten away.

The warts aren't all gone_ but all of them have begun to dry up and will be gone by the end of week 2. There's only slight pain where the warts used to be because they leave some pretty nasty wounds when they fall_ but neosporin is definitely helping. Like so many people have said READ the box. If you apply the cream only to the warts and are really careful not to touch healthy skin_ you don't even feel the acid doing it's thing.

I'm a strong person_ but right now i've been going through alot of stuff_ and for this STD to pop up its too much. I promise if these warts go away i will try my hardest not to have sex until marriage.

I went to the doctor and had the awkward conversation which resulted with me lying on my side wearing a hospital gown. She... yes she... told me it was most likely anal warts from HPV. I already assumed that so no real surprise there. She prescribed me Condylox Gel 0.5. I was ecstatic because my warts would be gone in up to 3 days. I finally was able to relax until day 3 of applying the cream. My warts were gone. Cool! But now my anus was dusted white and chapped and bleeding. The pain was pretty unbearable so I was glad to be starting the rest phase_ assuming the pain could only subside from that point on. PLUS MY WARTS WERE GONE!

75, 2, Genital Wart,Burning_ discoloration_ and burning flesh smell.,Due to the region of my warts_ having them surgically removed is not an option.  Therefore_ the only means of their removal is through Condylox_ which I absolutely HATE!  I've had to use it so much_ that I learned all of the tricks.  You have to be really careful that you apply it only to the warts; if you get it on normal skin_ it will literally erode your skin.  Also_ you really have to let the gel dry on the warts_ for about 5 minutes_ before you move around or put underwear on.  If you don't_ the gel will transfer onto healthy skin_ and cause serious pain.  Also_ put Vaseline on the area after it has completely dried to avoid irritation.  Using Condylox is painful_ even if you apply it carefully to the affected area; stay away from thongs!

Most of us think we are invincible to stds. I know I did. And worse_ I got it from my BF. In July of last year (8 months ago) I noticed little bumps down there. Ignored them. Never ONCE considered them to be an STD. Over time they got slightly itchy_would bleed every now and then. In early January I sucked it up_ put my dignity aside and went to the Dr. Left crying_ cried for days and started to resent my BF. Which I learned did nothing. Leaving him would only lead me to coping with a break up while dealing with this! I had a few in office treatments done (TCA) effective. Although very expensive. I was prescribed Condylox in a liquid form_ paid a lot for it_ $100_ used it for 3 days/2x a day. Not so bad. Yes I had small blistering. Yes my skin looked white and as if it could fall off but... it worked. And honestly it wasn't that painful. Left my skin dry and itchy but the warts were gone. About a week later... a few came back. Repeated the treatment_ used Aquaphore (by Eucerin.. like 4 bucks) to put on the skin whenever it hurt. A week later they were gone. So for all of  you who are crying_ upset_ scared...

Everyone talked about this horrible burning if you got the gel on your healthy skin so I have been extremellyyyy careful putting this on and so far I have no experienced this terrible pain that everyone talks about. I used aldara before and I applied it everywhere_ around the bump and anywhere I thought something was coming up. It never burned my skin and was a little uncomfortable at times but it took forever to see results and the finally one day boom! They were gone and I did experience the burning when you wipe after urinating but that's jay because of the open sore.. I mean part of what used to be flesh is gone. You could only expect that. I wish someone had told me about the neosporin because I just dealt with it_ it wasn't the mos horrible pain I've ever been in. Almost like getting a tattoo. Not the worst pain your gonna feel. As far as I can tell with the condylox it's working really well. The night I got my prescription I went home and used it and in the morning as well. I forgot to take my night dose so I applied this morning. And now it's evening and I just finished the application. Nobody says drying times an I'm afraid to get this gel on healthy skin becuase of the reviews so I wait 10 minutes after I apply to my last bump and I've never experienced the burning. There isndiscomfort during the day. Girls I suggest wearing boy,F,21,3  days 2X D,2/28/2010,Condylox
79, 4, HPV,Burning_ itching_ and swelling where affected area touched normal skin.  As everyone else on here has said_ DO NOT GET THIS STUFF ON NORMAL SKIN.,"This stuff worked wonders on the one wart that I had.  Only took one round!  By the 2nd day of treatment_ it was mostly gone and by the third day all that was left was a little tiny patch of ""scorched earth""_ if you know what I mean.  However_ on the 2nd day_ I made the mistake of freaking out and putting this stuff where I thought a wart MIGHT BE coming up and HOLY CRAP did it burn the bejesus out of my skin.  Only put this stuff on something that you KNOW is a wart and DO NOT put it anywhere near mucous membranes unless you want to have to stifle screams any time you have to pee.  It literally eats your flesh which is why it works so well on those nasty warts.",F,22,3  days0.05% 2X D,2/13/2010,Condylox
80, 3, HPV,burn_ general soreness_ itching.,well_ I first had mollescum_ now HPV. Its hard to say if this stuff works because I have so many little one's. The problem I have is seeing them cuz my pubes grow so fast and you're not supposed to razor shave. Well if I dont shave_ I cant see them!! So annoying! I bought a small beard trimmer but still have trouble seeing them. I've done cryo (wish they sold cryo-kits to the public) but not even a week later more sow up. I'm at my breaking point. Condylox_ please work!! update soon. I know they never go away but has anyone had success with them dissipating for long periods of time?,,26,6  days 2X D,2/10/2010,Condylox
81, 4, Genital Warts,Same side effects most people feel.  Severe burning immediately after putting on.  Then the rest of the first day goes normal after the burn wears off.  It's the second day that everything gets very raw and irritated.  I have never been able to use this product for 3 days in a row because of the pain.  But it does make a significant difference in the warts.  I am going this week to the urologist to get them either lasered or frozen or whatever it is that they do the warts.  He just wanted me to use this stuff to shrink the warts as much as possible before he got to them.,,M,33,2  days,12/5/2009,Condylox
82, 4, HPV-AW,Jesus Christ it burns when you apply it_ so do that when you are home alone.  Pretty sore and tender in the area that I used it.  BUT.....I am at the end of the first 3 days of use and by touch alone I can tell a different in the size of the warts.  I don't know that they will necessarily come off after this one cycle since I had them for a while_ but so far there seems to be improvement.  I'll take the pain anyday to get rid of these things.,I was diagnosed with HPV 4 years ago and have had two clean test results since then_ so I wasn't anticipating having issues_ but over the last couple months I noticed when i was wiping in the bathroom that bumps had started to appear in the region of my anus....I'm not into the anal sex idea_ person choice_ so I was perplexed when my GYN said that they were AW esp after two years of clean pap smears....whatever_ lucky me.  SO far I think its working but it will most likely take two treatment weeks for me.  Yes_ it DOES hurt like hell....but I can still walk to school everyday_ and I float in a hot bath at nite before my roommate comes home and hogs the hot water_ before I do the nite application.  Will be trying the Neo-pain relief for the 4 days off.,F,29,3  days,12/3/2009,Condylox
83, 5, HPV,Soreness_ itching_ burning_ pain_ open wounds,My warts were relatively small_ I had a dozen or so and had them frozen off. Some remained/reappeared so bought the cream online for about $240. Instead of using this twice a day I used it once a day for 5 days. I applied it with the blunt end of a needle_ and used very very little each time_ with the help of a mirror and flashlight. Also applied Vaseline to general area and waited at least 30 minutes before putting on clothes or moving around.Day 1. Did not feel discomfort at all. Wondered if it's working.Day 2. Some mild itching/burning.Day 3. Burning/Pain more intense. Some started to crust/scab up.Day 4. Warts turned into hard whitish scabs. Experienced pain when touched.Day 5. Some turned into open wounds. Applied Neosporin with Pain Relief.Day 6. Stop using Condylox. Keep applying Neosporin once a day.After that I just waited a couple of days for them to completely heal. It is about 2 weeks later now and they are gone and the spots are healed. I'm anticipating that they might return. At first I thought this was way too painful and annoying_ I should have just gotten them frozen off again. However_ this proved to work in the privacy of my own home. I still have a lot left so if they do flare up I can use again and save money by not going to the dermatologist. I think it's worth it if you do it correctly and don't mind a couple of days of discomfort. ,F,27,5  days,12/2/2009,Condylox
84, 4, gw aw,little burning,Not quite to the end of the first cycle. Didn't notice any change until today_ the 2nd day of not applying the gel. Had 1 small one that is almost gone in just the last day. 1 big one that looks like it is starting to dry up a little. I can now see it working. Thank GOD. Will post again soon with an update.,M,32,5  days,11/20/2009,Condylox
85, 5, Genital Warts,Stinging and Burning,My Doc froze my warts several times_ but they never totally went away. So she gave me Condylox_ told me to put it on my warts 3 consecutive days a week twice a day. okay. well_ the first go round was not pretty. She didn't really stres how careful you should be to NOT GET THIS ON YOUR NORMAL SKIN. I had a bunch in the area between my vagina and my rectum_ and I got some on skin down there_ I was in pain for a week. You can't sit_ walk_ do ANYTHING. But_ they did go away after the first week. They came back a couple weeks later and a few are in some tricky spots. But this time it isn't half as bad. I take my time and make sure to get it directly on the wart and make SURE it dries first as well. That would be my main advice_ take your time_ be accurate and make sure they dry and you'll have no problems. This gel is awesome at curing warts if you do it right.,F,21,1  months,11/9/2009,Condylox
86, 5, Anal Wart,Intense burning and itching after Day 3_ on first day off treatment. Exacerbated by movement. Lasted for four days_ on the fifth day off the treatment normal activities could be resumed. It would wake me up during the night_ that's how intense it was.,Give yourself time to do nothing but sit on the first day of rest_ time it so it falls on a free weekend. Neosporin cream with pain relief with be your best friend_ apply with a q-tip. For me sitting helped_ even in sleep. I took to sleeping in a chair for a few nights. Extremely effective_ just be aware of the side effects. Using petroleum jelly in unaffected areas to keep from getting it on your skin is highly advised.,M,21,3  days,11/8/2009,Condylox
87, 1, GW on anus,Burnt healthy skin_ rawness_ oozing_ light bleeding. malodor.  misery.,Ebola virus in a tube. Doc didnt advise me well on this stuff.  I put a dot on the wart on my crack_ which rubbed against the other cheek_ burning on both sides of the equator.  Painful to walk_ sit_ do just about anything.  Prescribed to take for 10 days_ if I did ten days of this stuff_ it would probably eat straight through to my colon.  Doc sliced the wart off_ then prescribed this to keep it from coming back.  now i just hope the rest of my skin down there grows back.    BE SUPER CAREFUL WITH THIS STUFF!,M,24,3  days,10/16/2009,Condylox
88, 5, GW,I had one big wart and some smaller ones and after the first day of using Condylox I only had the big one and one small one left. After the third day they are way smaller and are almost all gone. Judging from the rate of success from the first week_ by the end of the second week I expect them all to be completely gone. I'm glad I read this posting before I started using Condylox. I made sure to not get it on any healthy skin and I used a hair dryer on cool to let it dry. I experienced extreme itching and pain one of the nights and the day after it kind of hurt to walk but then the pain went away the next day. It wasn't anything unbearable and it was definitely worth it!  I might try neosporin the next week which might help with the itching.,I only dealt with itching and slight pain on one of the nights. I would definitely recommend this product. I used Aldara the week before and saw no results. After the first day of using Condylox I only had two warts left and they are almost gone after the third application. I have also been taking 2_000mg of vitamin C everyday_ eating healthy_ not smoking cigarettes and getting lots of sleep which is probably helping my immune system.,F,18,3  days,9/25/2009,Condylox
89, 3, GW on pubic area,mild buring and iching,i have not seen any changes in my warts. The Dr did not do a good job explaining to me what was going to happen or what i might expect during treatment. Now there are red spots over the warts which i hope is a good thing. My warts are still there so i hope they start to go away soon.,M,28,2  weeks,9/17/2009,Condylox
90, 5, Genital Warts,One little dot of gel on the wart works!! If you have big warts go get them frozen off_ it doesn't hurt at all and if you are embarassed_ do what I did_ find a female dermatologist!!,,M,40,2  weeks,8/28/2009,Condylox
91, 3, Genital Warts,Burning and pain.,This treatment is on par with the others I have had.  Aldara was the only thing that didn't hurt but I had an allergic reaction to it.  Cryotherapy was the most painful I have ever done_ because each wart is frozen. I have about 50 warts due to a severe outbreak because I am diabetic and I couldn't take the pain.   My last acid treatment left a sore.  I am praying that his will finally do the trick.,F,27,2  days,8/21/2009,Condylox
92, 3, shaft warts,i havent noticed any of the severe burning.  its a mild stinging for a bit.  its hard to get it exactly on the tiny warts.  its harder waiting naked for it to dry.  i use a cotton swab with the cotton removed_ its just a stick.  i refuse to use the applicator tube because it will waste the medicine and possibly not store as well or last as long.,the reason i want it to last a long time is because it waws $240!!!!!!!!!  standing there with them knowing why i had to have the gel was one thing and then standing there with $30 in my pocket and a credit card...sucked.  i had to charge the stuff but i must stop any growth or spreading.  im starting the 3rd day and they dont appear to be dying.,M,,2  days,8/21/2009,Condylox
93, 2, Anal Warts,Excruciating pain!_ stinging_ burning_ odor_ rotting skin,Just did the 1st three day treatment and I am at home right now_ cannot even walk from the pain. I have never felt such severe pain in my life. I think I would rather wait for the warts to fall off on their own than to use this medicine again. I would literally start crying when I sat on the toilet to apply the gel just thinking of the stinging and the pain after that. The warts are still there_ as big as ever and they seem swollen_ I cant go to the bathroom coz I cant wipe due to the pain. Im just miserable. On top of that I cant even shower and scrub btwn my buttocks coz of the pain. I now have a nasty odor on my privates like rotting flesh_ and it looks like my flesh is rotting down there. Will throw away that medicine for sure. At least I only paid $35 with my insurance.,F,30,3  days,8/18/2009,Condylox
94, 4, Molluscum,I had a few Molluscum spots in my genital area and since I did not like the idea of scarring due to freezing_ my Dr_ gave me condylox. The first two days of its use_ i felt nothing_ light burning on application but fine after that. Third day it started to feel that something was going on as the are started drying up. After the 4 day break I started applying Condylox again_ and on the 2nd day of my 2nd course_ the area became very very painful. I had issues walking_ sitting_ sleeping. I immediately went to see my Dr_ and he told me that i now have an infection and gave me Bactroban. Thatw as a miracle gel and the pain and the Molluscum went away withing 3-4 days. So my take is this. Use condylox and Bactroban togethr. You will have a strong likelihood of bacterial infection come in when the condylox starts working on the virus_ and that is what causes the pain. Bactroban at least in my opinion took care of the 2ndary infection,This gel works_ is very possible_ but you have to be patient. My molluscum disappeared on the 2nd course_ but it is so powerful that it caused infection to creep in and thats where the pain came from. I would ask the dr to also give you some anti bacterial gel to rub once or twice a day. The condylox is though no guarantee that Molluscum will not happen again. Mine disappeared but in 1 and a half months a few more popped up. Now I know the routine so attacking it with the condyloc Bactroban combination,M,39,12  days,8/2/2009,Condylox
95, 4, GW,Some discomfort with the effected areas after application. the non infected skin must have gotten the gel on it cause there is a patch of dried_ slightly tinted red skin. It looks dry and crackled. Does anyone know after applying the gel if you're supposed to let it sit here or wash it off after it dries or what?!,Aside from what i said over there_ i'm wondering what everyone else does after applying the gel? Do you let the gel just stay there or do you let it dry for a bit then wash and dry before going about your day? the box doesn't really say.,M,24,4  days,7/28/2009,Condylox
96, 3, GW,Painful_ burnsss,So I was diagnosed with HPV about two years ago_ and I now have my first symptom_ GENITAL WARTS. At first it FREAKED ME OUT! I had no idea what it was because I was cleared from HPV_ so I thought I didn't have it anymore.  I was prescibed condylox from my doctor_ and it BURNS!!! I have to literally prepare myself before putting it on. And once I put it on I had to breathe like I am having a baby and count to twenty.  I do not know how many warts I have_ but at first it was a little thing_ but the first doctor prescibed me aldara and it seem to make it worse. So then I was given condylox_ I am on day two and they seem to be getting better_ but I am not competely sure_ right now I am just looking forward to the four day break_ and hoping they are gone before the next three application days.  And like everyone else said DO NOT GET IT ON THE HEALTHY SKIN_ I seen little red bumps around my warts_ which I thought were maybe more warts growing in the process_ but now I am starting to think I was WRONG. I will be back tomorrow_ hopefully I have luck like some of these other ppl and they fall off by the third day.,F,21,2  days,7/23/2009,Condylox
97, 3, Genital Warts,About two months ago i realized I had some wart like bumps on my pubic patch.  I went to the doctor she thought it was folliculitis because I shave and I was relieved.  I then went to the dermatologist today because they have recently been worse and I wanted an answer.  I whiped it out and he saw them for all of 2 seconds and said they were warts and I was shocked. Told me to use condylox and I will post soon and give an update.,I used the gel for the first time a few hours ago and have not felt any burning or itching yet so I hope it doesn't occur.  Its a total mind blow that I could have genital warts at age 19,M,19,1  days,7/23/2009,Condylox
98, 4, hpv anal warts,Burning for about a min after condyloz is applied.. some iching not much.,I have used aldara I had no problems with it matter of fact my hpv infection was gone for 4 years thought it cured me. But I have reached a outbreak and can't get ride of them. I used aldara again. And they won't go away just makes them smaller... so I applied a ton of it and it lit my ass on fire lol.... that's only eay I could see a affect... so I just finished my first wee treatment today and the area looks white.... as if its been soaking in water... haven't experience dry affect yet or crust.. no order either.. looks like it has remove some warts I had 3 small ones and 1 bigger one that were white colored ne ways... some blood after applying condylox just spots... and I think there looks like there is a hole where a wart may have been still to early to see full results... but this site is good info for peeps with hpv,M,24,3  days,7/19/2009,Condylox
99, 3, External Genital Warts,a lot of burning_ skin peeling_ redness everywhere...hardcore stuff,I was prescribed it about a week ago...the doc said i had 50-100 bumps it was pretty bad. But i used this for one week and they are gone! i might have one or two but im waiting to see exacally whats goin on before i do it again because the gel is  made my pubic region really sensitive and red and im missing some skin :(.

101, 1, GW,"I was prescribed this medication is 1991 for warts. I suffered a severe chemical burn that was so very painful. The vulvar skin never healed and I had to have reconstructive surgery b/c the ""acid"" I will call it burned me to pieces. Since that time_ I have not had children_ cannot have sex_  and live in chronic debilitating vulvar pain. How is that for a side effect from this mediaction? Get your warts lasered!!",NEVER USE THIS.

102, 4, Genital Warts (anal),It burned a lot_ and I really couldn't move for the couple of days I used it. But - it reduced the size of my warts drastically.,Make sure you put it on the warts ONLY - It will cause sever pain and bleeding if put on skin.,M,18, ,6/17/2009,Condylox
103, 1, Genital Warts,Stinging_ difficulty moving if it stretched affected skin_ moderate pain at all times_,Do not take condylox gel. It is very painful and takes too long. It's also very expensive. (It cost me $200 WITH insurance.) Just have them frozen off. I know that sounds scary_ but the pain is rather minimal and the it doesn't hurt very much at all after. The skin dies more quickly and flakes off within 5 days. Condylox didn't take away as many as freezing did and I only had to go to the doctor's office twice for treatment. Only two warts had remained after the first visit. They don't even know how condylox gel warts...that in itself should be scary.,M,18,3  days,6/14/2009,Condylox
104, 4, GW,Burning_ Stinging_ Pain_ Soreness_ Odor.,This stuff works_ but like everyone else has said previously- BE CAREFUL! Only apply to warts not healthy skin. It stings upon application and hurts starting around the 2nd day of treatment. This is the second time I've used it and it took a lot for me to even do it again because the last time I couldn't sit_ stand or properly wipe myself! But like I said it works- and I will take pain over embarrassing warts any day!,F,25,3  days,6/11/2009,Condylox
105, 1, Anal GW,None except for the fact that I now have 2 holes in my anus. One I was born with and the second one was from this horrible acid called Condylox.,Worst pain ive ever felt. The scariest part is that I can visibly see missing flesh. I cant sleep at night. I cant walk. Im debating whether I should go to the ER right now. I used the appropriate amount. It just spread around the area when I walked. I cant imagine a pain worse that this. In just 3 days it has eaten about a depth of 1cc of skin right off. bloody too.

I applied the medicine exactly as was perscribed_ i.e only applied to the molluscum that had popped up. Well day four it burnt a bit_ was scratch_ though a good scratch_ and the skin has turned brittle and dark.Lets see what happens next_ though on physical examination_ the molluscum seem to be drying up,,M,39,4  days,5/15/2009,Condylox
107, 1, genital warts,n/a,ive never used condylox. i use yellow dial soap. sounds too good to be true (and for those that have many large warts it might not work) but i only get one or two medium sized warts maybe once a year and yellow dial soap gets rid of them in less than a week. sounds crazy i know but it works for me and NO PAIN...also i try to keep a very good diet so that my immune system is healthy.,F,26,0  days,5/5/2009,Condylox
108, 3, anal warts,not taken yet.,So_ the surgeon told me to have my anal warts removed at surgery. then i went to a GI doctor and he told me that they normally do surgery in my community because we have lots of surgeons available and this is a easy task. I asked him about condylox and he prescribed to me_ Im now afraid to use it because of all of these comments below_ it seems like 1 or a few days of pain from surgery is far less pain than everyone here having to go through it for possibly 4 weeks. any suggestions?,M,27,0  days,5/2/2009,Condylox
109, 2, genital warts (rectal),Stinging and burning for about 90 seconds.  Slight to moderate discomfort for the duration of treatment.,I had about 20-30 warts total of various sizes about 6 of them were pretty large and seemed to be main ones which the smaller ones were growing around.  I went through 1.5 small bottles of Condylox paying about $130 USD for each bottle.  I used it for 4 days on then I would take a week off.  After the first treatment many of the smaller warts were gone and the larger ones became smaller.  After many weeks of treatment all but 1 large wart were gone.  This 1 very large wart would swell up during the treatment then shrink down to the size it was before the treatment week.  Getting frustrated that I could not get rid of this last one I searched for alternative treatments.  I read that Apple Cider Vinegar can get rid of all warts.  I tried this which I would pour some on a cotton ball or balled up tissue and dab it all over the infected area.  There was only a little bit of stinging for about 20 seconds and no discomfort after the application.  I did this about 3-4 times a day morning after noon evening and before I went to bed.  In about 2 weeks the final wart was gone.  It has been about a year now and the warts have not returned.  My suggestion is to anyone w/any wart infection to try this if you don’t have any allergies to Apple Cider Vinegar.  Its far less painful and very inexpensive and a natural treatment as opposed to an unnatural chemical one.,M,33,6  months,3/30/2009,Condylox
110, 3, gw,I had 1 wart on my anal region. Experienced severe pain_ redness and bleeding_ mild odor all around the area where the gel got on the healthy skin tissue on the 2nd rest day after 3 days of treatment.,I cannot stress enough DO NOT let this gel get on healthy skin tissue. It is very severe pain and bleeding. I feel like my skin is raw and peeling away. When it says let it dry wait at least 30 minutes to move at all. I think the product does its job considering the wart is about gone but so is my entire anal region. It didn't effect me like this until the 2nd rest day but I'm telling you it is so very painful if it gets on healthly skin. I have been using neosporin with pain relief which helps_ but I'm wondering how long it will take that area to heal. It is so tender and it burns when I walk. It truly is horrible pain. And it is bled alot that 2nd rest day. If you apply it correctly with patience it will work_ however BE CAREFUL! Had I known how bad it was gonnna be I would have been more careful.,F,27,3  days,3/11/2009,Condylox
111, 4, genital venereal warts,PAIN - SWELLING,I misused the drug due to the fact that i didnt read the directions or research the net about it.  I wish i would have found this page before i used it or read the directions that were given to me when i picked up the prescription.  Being a dumb ass man_ i just put it all over my penis and on the warts.  My penis swelled twice its size it seems and was very painful.  I knew i was suppose to use it for three days then rest.  I did so_ but was missusing the gel everywhere on my penis head and shaft.  Finally instinct told me to stop using it and rest.  Im on day 3 of rest and my penis is back to normal and the warts are deadening and old skin is coming off.  Now reading this I will start up tommorrow AFTER my showers and apply ONLY on the warts themselves with a cotton swab applicator a small dot on the warts.  I only have three and expect they will disappear soon.  They are already dead it seams_ but when I shower they turn white and are noticeable.  I will apply only for three more day,M,39,3  days,3/3/2009,Condylox

I wanna cry!,The medicine is working_ but this seems like a lot of pain to go through. My doctor told me that taking this medicine was the pain free route to take and so far it's been farrrrr from pain free.

114, 1, GW,Very Painful,I used the gel about a year ago.  It did great_ but afterwards I continued to feel itching around my vaginal area.  Went to the dr_ and she said it was a yeast from the antibiotic.  Most of the itch went away with yeast infection meds_ but a little didn't.  The problem is I put the gel on healthy skin_ and it caused a itch that has never went away.  I am not sure if it's a yeast or bacteria from the gel that will not go away.

115, 4, HPV / G. Warts,Day 1. I have 13 warts on base of my shaft and 1 about a little over an inch above my shaft. I applied it about an hour ago. Not feeling any burning or tingling on the wart itself. The only pain I have experienced is some of the condylox gel rubbed on my inner thigh and had a slight burn until I washed it with soap and water. Hopefully I put enough on      because I can not feel any burning onthe warts. I'll send day 2 update tomorrow,I just advise be very careful when you apply it.

116, 1, wartsonmydaughters belly,i stupidly brought my daughter to a dermatalogist for two warts on her belly that in 3 months of treatments spread to 6 and now one over her eye_ shes only 8 and i dont know where it could have come from_ i was told its a virus_ now when i searched for this new cream they prescribed i see its for genital warts and it annoys me that this could be prescribed for a child_ and im so retarted i didnt think of searching first_ after 900 dollars out of pocket for this medicine i see its a big mistake_ i was told to do it twice a day on each wart and what she has is a big red burnt areas around her stomache and chest_ that burned the crap out of her_ so not acceptable for a kid to go through_ so dermatalogist provides a cream called desonide which after i read up on it now it is a steroid and should not be put on children!! I'm so fed up with this! i cant believe this is happening to us!so anyone that reads this before buying for a child_ do not even try to put on ur kids_ also this cream is f,for what it does it may be good for an adult but definitely not for a child!,F,8,5  days,1/15/2009,Condylox
117, 4, genital warts,after the first cycle of using this gel i could barely walk_ i WAS swollen_ had open sores and it burned soo much. I didn't take any medicine for the intense pain. After three days I was able to go back to normal and my vagina looked normal again and I was clear from all the warts i had. two months later I saw warts appear and everytime I see one_ I put the gel onto them. I am careful now and never have experienced the pain I went through the first time,this medicine is very expensive but very useful. make sure to only apply to warts n let dry until the wart looks white.,F,21,3  days,1/13/2009,Condylox
118, 4, hpv warts,"not too much.actually maybe a little itching_ and a little discmfort by the ones on my ""nacha"" (not your vagina / not your butthole)",i've read the commentsabove and i have to say i was pretty impressed. i was so scared to try it because of burning and the sore i read above_ but within the first application i noticed they were smaller. well at least the ones that were similiar to tag moles. the larger warts i noticed looked a bit dryed out. this morning i applied my second application_ they are sore to touch but no scorching burning pain. but i applied my gel with a q-tip and i had a magnifying mirror to make sure i was applying it ONLY to the warts themselves. i dont completely cover my entire warts either. just the head of them_ maybe that would help cut down the burning on the other people who are experiencing pain. but also i take a shower before each application. but i'll be back in a couple of days to let you guys know how it goes. i also started taking vitamin c each day starting yesterday when i did my first application to help boost my immune susytem so maybe that will be a factor in the healing process. i r,F,27,2  days,12/18/2008,Condylox
119, 4, Genital warts.,General sorness.  kind of hurt to walk.,I think the main thing with this is making sure you DO NOT hit healthy skin.  I have about seven..some were rather large.  I'm on day two and they are over halfway off.I'm having some pain.  I'd call it just sore feeling though and it hurts to walk a BIT but nothing like anybody else is saying. I hvae two doese left and seeing as how they are hanging off i know they'll be gone in one round of treatment.It takes me nearly thrity mins. to put this on.  I cannot stress that enough GET A HARD MIRROR IF YOU ARE A WOMAN AND MAKE SURE YOU DONT HIT ANY HEALTHY SKIN.  I ALSO PUT A MINIMAL AMOUNT ON AND IT DID THE JOB.I'm pretty sure a lot of people are overusing this.  Also ladies if you have a hair dryer put it on cool and dry it with that...that way it doesn't migrate.,F,28,2  days,12/17/2008,Condylox
120, 2, Genital Warts,I have not had any side effects.  My doctor told me I would be in pain and possibly could not walk.  Well I am on the second week and I have not had any pain or discomfort at ALL!!,I keep wondering if I am not putting on enough or if I am not letting it dry long enough.  Well that cannot be the case because I completely covered every visible wart with the medicine AND let it dry for at least 30 minutes before I put clothes back on.  I am so frustrated!!!,F,22,2  weeks,12/14/2008,Condylox
121, 5, Genital Warts,Burning_ SORE!!_ swelling_ redness.,Condylox worked great on me! I had MANY lesion and tried a variety of things such as TCA_ salicylic (sp?) acid_ teatree oil_ etc.  This cleared almost all of the warts (apprx 15-25 present) after the first week. I am on the second week and only have  4 warts left...its amazing and i am so happy/relieved!!!!! During the three day treatment_ it was about day 3 that I started feeling sore_ some swelling and pain. During the off days_ the warts were discolored (white) and peeled off. I soaked myself in a warm bath for 20 minutes to help shed the dead skin off and then washed the area with mild soap and warm water. If you put too much and get it on good skin_ the gel will kill healthy skin so apply carefully and NOT all over! applying the gel to skin other than the wart will result in increased pain. The pain wasnt THAT unbearable and at this point_ I was so desperate to get rid of the warts that I was willing to deal with the side effects...Give it a shot_ its worth it!,F,22,2  weeks,12/10/2008,Condylox
122, 3, genital warts,oh my goodness be careful!! If you want to get ride of them it totally works but you may have to deal with some pain.,I was recently diagnosed with genital warts.... I havent had sex in two years and BOOM all of a sudden there they were. So to answer the comment for the guy experiencing bumps 9 years later it is DEFINITELY possible with HPV... it incubuates for a long time and usually guys carry it for years before it affects them_ if it even does. Men usually just carry it and give it to others without knowing.  As far as treatment goes I've been doing some research and hear that tea tree oil may help cure the disease_ I figure its worth a try! Good luck everyone!!,F,18,3  days,12/1/2008,Condylox
123, 1, to get rid of genital warts,Wow. uh it totally is not worth the pain. i have barely been able to walk for 3 days. My labia was sore 3 times its normal size and i had visible holes in my skin. the neosporin did help_ but i can't imagine ever taking this knowing the side effects are so serious. what is worse is that my doctor didnt warn me of anyting serious and my pharmacist had no idea what to do.,Don't do it! Try everything else before you try it! Getting rid of a few warts is not worth this pain and suffering!,F,18,3  days,11/30/2008,Condylox
124, 3, doctor told me to,i was experiencing an intolerable itch in my netherlands_ both near the anus as well as le vagine.  he removed two warts about 3 weeks ago but the itching still persisted so he prescribed this for me.  i also have lidocaine/prylocaine that is a numbing agent but even that couldn't assuage the burning and swelling produced by the condylox.,"i am on day three and my lady love was so swollen this morning that i could barely get out of bed this morning and it kept me up all night.  i showered this morning and waited a few hours before reapplying after reading comments here that the swelling seemed to be ""normal"" side effect and now i'm just holding tight.  the itching seems to be gone i guess_ either that or my brain receptors are only picking up on the bruised_ painful swelling.  peeing hurts_ yes; as well as wiping_ drying after shower_ sitting_ wearing pants_ pretty much everything.  tonight is last application before i go 4 days without so keep you posted.",F,24,3  days,11/12/2008Email,Condylox
125, 3, Genital Warts,During the 3 day application process_ I had to stop using it on the 2nd day because my vagina was swollen so bad! My doctor didn't warn me about the side affects_ and I didn't take the directions on the box very serious because I didn't think it was that  powerful! But this pain is...ugh. I can't pee_ and when i do_ the open sores will burn and if I try to wipe_ it stings like crazy! But I think it may be working because there have been small drops of blood..Anyway_ if it works_ it was totally worth it because warts are nasty and embarrasing.,I think Condylox needs to warn you more about the serious side effects.Great results_ but serious side effects. I think I will try neosporin because everybody on her says it eases the pain.,F,18,3  days,11/11/2008,Condylox

BUT_ it has been 9 years since I was with an infected gal? She told me after the fact... I figured after a few years I got lucky. Is it possible they could show up 9 years later? I have been with my wife and only my wife the entire time? ( she had only one partner previous to me and has never had signs herself ).  I suspect it is from my past_ but 9 years_ I haven't read of anything incubating that long?  anyone have any comments...

I had what I thought and a doctor told me were genital warts around the base of the head of my penis.  Turns out after using Condylox_ freezing_ and aldera............they weren't even warts at all.  PPP a condition that has nothing to do with warts or sex.  Here is a link to the condition.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearly_penile_papulesAs far as the condylox.........use it carefully.  I was in severe pain for days (3 days after the first cycle of treatment).  Had to take off work for one day due to the pain.  Only use it on the bump.

I think it'll be another week before i can get the last few that are left.  My problem was that the Pharmacist Told me to put it around the warts on my good skin_ to speed the process up_ so i did.  for 3 days.  So now 3 days later my labia are swollen twice as big as normal_ and i'm red and sore EVERYWHERE.

I think im doing something wrong though. The doctor told me I could use vaseline to prtect the healthy skin so I used A&D onitment. I have been having a hard time getting rid of the other 2 I wonder if it has anything to do with using the a&d ointment. my recommendation would be to use neosporin or a&d after the 3 day cycle.,M,23,3  weeks,6/20/2008,Condylox

141, 5, Warts,Burning_ slight aftertaste of Juniper or Pine tree sap 30-minutes after application which is probably from the medication getting into the bloodstream and being picked up by the taste buds and olfactory sensors,I've had genital warts for about a year and tried many different medications - over-the-counter_ Aldara_ etc.  Don't waste your money on over-the-counter or Aldara.  The doctors bounced me around from doctor to doctor_ and one even did a biopsy to check for cancer.  It was obvious the outbreak was genital warts_ but in my opinion_ the doctors saw an opportunity to remove money from my wallet and my insurance company.  Do not use Aldara - VERY expensive_ and very ineffective.  The last doctor finally reluctantly prescribed Condylox.  He warmed me it would be painful.  It can be painful_ but it is not bad.  You must be careful to not get the medication on uninfected skin - it will burn the skin.  The treatment seems to kill skin cells_ both infected_ and non-infected if it contacts them.  Follow the instructions - two treatments a day for three days_ followed by four days of non-treatment.  Wash and keep the area very clean.

I went to the doctor and now have to soak and apply antibiotic lotion / cream.   I have some blisters from it.  If you use it.  Be very careful_ apply small amounts to your warts - and don't worry if it doesn't do anything - it's a cumulative effect.  Anyone else have these problems?

I am currently in my first week of treatment. I am on the 2nd day of rest. I believe one of the very small ones came off today with a little sore underneath_ nothing big. I have about 3 or 4 big ones that have since turned a blackish color_ which makes me think that they will soon fall off_ but they are very sore. I got some on regular skin and I'll tell you what_ do NOT let that happen! It has burned the normal skin and is all red and has a white pussy look. That is the most painful part. I would say on a scale of 1-10 with pain_ most of the time it is about a 3 but there are times_ especially with the area of good skin that came in contact with it that it is about a 6. I am hoping that my next treatment week will get rid of the bigger ones for good. It looks really gross and I can't wait to be done with this.,M,26,5  days,5/22/2008,Condylox

The first treatment week got rid of most of them_ but I had so many that I missed a few..but they should be gone by the second treatment. I will say that I'm glad I read this before starting the drug because neosporin cream has saved me big time! Condylox just basically eats them off..kind of like an acid.

In my case_ I went in for chyrotherapy 3 times over 6 weeks to remove a large wart (about the diameter of a dime.) Chryotherapy managed to break it up alot.  Condylox wiped out the stuff the deep freeze missed.  By day 4 or 5_ both treatments hurt the same amount.The wart was on the underside of the shaft of my penis. I used the gel for it.

I could barely walk w/out toughing the raw skin.,seriously please don't get this medication on anything that is not wart tissue!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't experiment!!!!! it literally ate through the connection where the head connects to the shaft. I was able to pull the head off almost and see the smooth muscle that is underneath_ not fun at all had. presently I am all scarred up. But I rather have a slight color problem than warts everywhere! I had about 10 tiny warts_ after 1 treatment all were gone but 2.

Putting vaseline around he area BEFORE applying and being careful not to get any on the wart/warts prevents unnecessary pain in unaffected areas. After applying_ the pain gradually decreased throughout the day.,I used this product about 7 months ago. I had 3 warts and this stuff got rid of all of them. I am very impressed with this product. It essentially gradually burned off my warts. I had wart recurrences when I tried to get warts to go away on their own_ but since using this not ONE has resurfaced.

159, 3, warts,I too just finished my first 3 days am now in my 4th day of treatment. I'm going through a bit of pain now (fairly painful) and some through the night last night (night 3). I did apply the gel a little bit beyond just the warts themselves (i have 6-7)... but i chose to do this. I've had these warts ONLY in the area between the ass and the testicles. Very hard to walk..ouch.,I've been treating these warts for 2 years now. I get em every few months. Went to dermatologists- froze_ zapped with electricity_ and even tried that crappy Aldara which did nothing but scar and discolor me (vitaligo) which i'm insanely upset at. Now i'm trying condolox- if it works_ i'll be so happy. If anyone has any insight or similar contion_ i'd welcome any help. I'll be posting my outcome in a few weeks.,M,35,3  days,1/16/2008,Condylox
160, 3, genital warts,I just did one cycle_ and found that I am in extreme pain. I know now after reading these comments that I messed up on the application_ and did not just put it on the wart itself. I learned my lesson. I have tried the neosporene as an aide for the pain_ but how long does it take for that pain to go away? I know everyone is different. My fear is that I have such raw skin that if I put more of the Condylox on it will cause other problems. Any help?Also_ when the warts are tried should they appear black and simply wash off?,,M,29,3  days,12/19/2007Email,Condylox
161, 4, warts,burning after the 3rd day and it got on area around wart and is still dry and swollen almost a month later,After 3rd day the 3 warts were gone. 2 have since come back and am currently treating area again. If anyone knows when the swelling of the normal skin will go away please let me know.,M,27,3  days,11/18/2007,Condylox
162, 1, genital warts,red sores. pain_ discomfort. itching.,i used this stuff for like 2 months and used tho whole bottle and they still didnt go away. i did everything right and no results. this gel sucks.,M,20,64  days,11/15/2007,Condylox
163, 4, HPV,Slight pain/burning.  The worst for me was the smell. It has been about a week or so since I stopped using Condylox and there is still a HORRID smell.  Did anyone else experience this?  How long did it take for the smell to go away for you,Used once_ warts gone in 3 days,F,27,3  days,11/6/2007,Condylox
164, 5, HPV/ genital warts,Area beneath warts was sore after completion of dosage.  Lasted little more than 24 hours and was manageable.  I had small open sores where the warts fell off but they were not painful and healed within the day.,I used this exactly as prescribed(2 times a day for 3 days).  In the first week all that was treated was removed.  More budded out the next week and were gone only after 1 day of treatment. It is hard to apply because of the region and takes time to dry. Just be patient_ because it works!! I did not experience severe burning.  I assume this is because it never touched my healthy skin.  I also gave it plenty of time to dry. So far no more have appeared. I expect more to come up and will treat them with condylox until they stop appearing. Keep your spirits up.  This WILL go away and this does NOT define who you are!,F,22,2  weeks,11/3/2007,Condylox
165, 4, HPV,Intense burning after the 3 day period and some bleeding,Be very careful about getting it on your other skin as I did. It was very difficult to determine and see where I was putting it on so I think I burned the surrounding skin.  I do need to say it worked after just one treatment cycle!! So the pain now that it has gone away was worth it_ but during the 3 to 4 days after the initial 3 day treatment was intense.  Aldara did nothing and takes forever to see any results. My dr did not tell me to use neosporin but after reading it here I am so glad I did_ it really helps speed up the healing.,F,34,3  days,10/25/2007,Condylox
166, 4, HPV/genital warts,severe burning and itching_ open sores_ bleeding.,This is now my third time using condylox i have another comment on this page from less then a year ago 1/07. this time around its not as bad just sever itching so bad i cant sleep. what i found that helps me at work is neosporin  the gel or cream with the pain relief.,F,23,3  weeks,10/1/2007,Condylox
167, 4, Genital Warts,It stings a little and if you get it on any normal skin it can itch a little bit,"DON""T GIVE UP! i went through two treatments and didn't see any difference at ALL and i was extremely upset. I think i might have been too anxious. my third treatment week_ the little bitches started to disappear! i also want to say that if it's in a skin fold_ ""wait for it to dry"" means wait quite some time. i kept thinking it was dry and letting the skin fold go and i kept burning my normal skin with the gel. also_ if you just sit there and wait for it to dry it seems to work a lot quicker.",F,21,27  days,9/26/2007,Condylox
168, 3, Anal Warts,I was not informed of the side effects of this drug. The burning is pretty painful. I'm not sure how it got to normal skins unless it spreads once it dries and I walk around. Very painful. Hopefully the burning will subside for the (4) day break.,,M,31,3  days,9/20/2007,Condylox
169, 1, GW,Excruciating pain!!!  I just applied it on less than 5 minutes ago and F---!!!!!!!!  How do you keep it off normal skin when you have to apply it on your scrotum?  I don't even put much_ but its got me walking like someones kicked me in the nuts due to the massacre it leaves behind.  The burning effect is like nothing I have ever felt b4.  This is my 3rd application and my last.  I shouldn't have to fan my nuts and keep from screaming just to get a few warts off.  I am so afraid of applying this gel again that I wont.  I am not reliving that again.  Seems like most people here are happy with this product.  Good for them.,NEVER AGAIN,M,26,3  days,9/19/2007,Condylox
170, 4, HPV,OUCH!  Make SURE you use it as directed and ONLY ONLY ONLY put it on the bumps or warts.  Hold any foreskin/labial skin AWAY from the medicine until it dries.  After the 3 days on_ it hurts a little_ but it's the rubbing from underwear_ pants_ and running/walking that make it tender.,Ugh_ HPV.  It's embarassing in the first place.  I had flat raised spots on the head of my penis_ about 7-8.  They didn't hurt_ but who wants to pass on HPV or have a 'cootie cock?'So I got the medicine.  First off_ get the GENERIC.  Condylox is pricy.  I got it from the internet_ but you can shop around online at Walgreens.com_ etc to find the lowest price.  Don't freak out when it works...it's necrotizing_ ie: it kills the tissue you apply it to.  Generally I see very little_ but a couple of the raised spots are now kinda black and scabbing...another slight ouch.  This medicine clearly works_ tho!And don't be embarassed...spread the word!  Over 75% of the sexually active population has been exposed to HPV_ and over 50% of us have it.,M,43,3  days,6/28/2007,Condylox
171, 5, HPV,Applied and within 3 day they were gone... i been suffering for 2 years with GW and my dr. decided to just prescribe this to me... im still pissed at him.. i used Aldara and was a horror show.. if you are ever prescribed aldara DO NOT TAKE IT.. Condylox definately worked for me...,Its gel and not cream.. gel is much better to apply then the cream like aldara cause cream seem to go all over the place when you move.. the gel will dry up and stay in the spot you treat,F,32,4  days,6/24/2007,Condylox
172, 5, Genital warts,Some slight discomfort the first couple times I used it_ because I kept getting it on normal skin_ but once I got the hang of it there was only a slight tingling_ not uncomfortable at all.USE IT AS RECOMMENDED by your physician and with the gel itself!  I used it EXACTLY as recommended by my doc and on the box: 4 days on_ 3 days off before starting again.  Minimal side effects and discomfort when you use it correctly!,I had 6 very small warts_ one slightly larger.  After the first day_ they were already looking diminished.  By the 4th day I almost couldn't see where to put it!  Only two have come back_ the larger one_ and one that was next to it_ and they are still much smaller than before the first treatment.  It is just amazing to feel smooth skin where there were ugly bumps before.  Definitely a success story with Condylox.,F,23,4  days,5/31/2007,Condylox
173, 5, Anal Warts,After applying Condylox_ the first cycle_ I was experienced burning_ sharp pain and some discharge. I had about 20 small warts and a few larger ones. I was unable to target the small ones due to difficulty reaching the anal area. I applied the soultion on normal skin over the three day period_ which is where I experienced rawness and pain. I am currently on the second phase_ clearing up the ones which did not fully disappear. I find that there is swelling which I may have confused as warts prior to the second stage. I waited five and a half days to begin the second stage and swelling cleared. Very effective.,Condylox worked great for me. It cleared about 95% of my warts after the first stage. I am working on my second stage and it looks better everyday. Remember to be patient and use care when applying the product. I believe that the pain associated with this treatment is due to its application on normal skin_ as it seems to deteriorate it. The discomfort I felt was worth it. You can also use neosporin after the 3 day application period to ease recovery.,M,20,10  days,5/19/2007,Condylox
174, 5, Anal Warts,Side effects included burning_ bleeding and discomfort.,Used Aldara before with no avail. I had 6 anal warts and after the first treatment of Condylox. All of them were gone. I highly recommend this product. Be careful when applying. Apply only to warts. As soon as your 3 days are up immediately apply petroleum jelly and polysporin to areas. The wart area will be burned.  This will help ease the pain and will heal area quicker.,M,36,1  weeks,5/3/2007,Condylox
175, 4, Genital warts,Some mild pain -- perhaps better described as an itch rather than pain.  I really have to wonder if the raters describing excruciating pain were using it properly.You apply the gel only to the warts_ and should be careful to avoid getting it on normal skin.  It will burn normal skin.,"In the past I had warts treated with electrocautery_ but that was an extremely unpleasant experience.  The warts came back in a few weeks_ and I wanted to try something different.  This is much better than the surgery_ in my opinion.I did one ""treatment week_"" and managed to remove all but the largest of my warts.  That one then grew to be even larger than it was before_ so I've done another week of the stuff.  I'm going to follow up with another week just to make sure that it's gone.Overall I would absolutely recommend this.",M,27,2  months,5/2/2007,Condylox

177, 3, hpv,burning. intense pain.  open sores. very alarming.  using it for a second time_ put it on for 6 days straight_ all over_ terrible inflamation and sores.  totally freaked out.,,,,6  days,4/20/2007,Condylox
178, 4, HPV - Genital Warts,Burning sensation in the affected area. To measure the pain_ I would say it was about a 4 out of 10. That's it!,Much better than Aldara cream which was ineffective even after weeks of use in my case. I've used Condylox for one full-week cycle and my warts are disappearing. It's an amazing feeling when they start to go away. I'm so happy there's finally a drug that actually works in clearing HPV warts. Oh and by the way_ before I started Condylox_ I also had them frozen first. This really helps if you have a lot of warts like I did.,M,24,3  days,4/18/2007,Condylox
179, 5, Genital Warts,Burning sensation_ particularly on any surrounding unaffected skin; increasing soreness over three day treatment.,I had 3 small warts near the opening to my vagina. They were gone within 3 days; they turned white and after the 3rd day could be wiped off or scraped off the skin. I have been checking every week since November for them. It is now April. In January I noticed one very tiny wart had reappeared_ but it disappeared after one application and I have experienced nothing since. I'm hoping it stays that way; after another year I'm going to assume I'm cured.,F,26,3  days,4/6/2007,Condylox
180, 4, HPV,Incredible soreness_ swelling_ burning and some bleeding.  I have an unusually high threshold for pain but this put me way over my tolerance level.  I used it for one treatment week and I'm not certain the warts are gone because the treated area is so raw I can't tell.  If they're gone_ then it was worth it - if I have to do another week then I'm not certain.  This site really helped me know that I'm not alone in this situation.,If the warts are not gone after the first treatment I might ask the doctor about cutting them off.,F,56,3  days,2/12/2007,Condylox
181, 4, Genital Warts,Burning_ soreness and inflamation. I've been off condylox for 3 days and the worst day was the second day I was off of the medicine. I couldn't sit down in my car to drive to work_ I walked like a duck because it killed me to walk normally. I've never been in this bad of pain. The medication definately worked but it continues to put me in pain now on the third day. I'm hoping things will get better soon otherwise I will be calling my doctor to get some kind of medication for pain.,,F,19,3  days,1/24/2007,Condylox
182, 4, genital warts,the pain was horrible_ soreness_ burning everything...but the worst for me is the smell. its horrid_ like rancid horribleness it makes my underwear stink. did anyone else have this side effect? your skin gets white like after you take off a bandaide..and then it reeks!,this is my second time using condylox. i used aladara in between but it never made the warts even buidge a bit. condylox works but its unbelieveable hell!!,F,22,3  days,1/17/2007,Condylox
183, 5, Genital Warts,There was slight soreness on the warts where I applied condylox. The slight pain did stop after the 2nd day of not using it. There was no blistering...or bleeding..,This is the best to clear warts. I highly recomend it. I had 2 large warts and just completed my first week cycle...they are just about gone now. They scab up and turn a crusty brown..and within a week they came off....now there are only two tiny bumps where they were...I expect this to be gone after this week.,M,38,3  days,12/20/2006,Condylox

187, 5, genital warts,I used condylox for 3 days in a row and it removed all my warts. i used it 2times a day morning and night.then the 4th day i didnt use it.During these days i did have alot of unconfort. i had alot of itching and burning. My skin around the areas where i applied condylox was raw and bleeding. It looked like an open wound. on the 4th day once i saw that the wart were gone i applied neosporin to the wounds and my wounds healed in about 3days.This gel works to remove warts but it is very painful.I rather feel the pain then to walk around with warts.Any antibiotic ointment like neosporin would work to heal any wounds left by condylox.,It works but its a painful process.I do recommend it if you have warts.,M,21,3  days,11/1/2006,Condylox
188, 2, genital warts,Itching_ burning_ slight bleeding.,I just completed my third week of treatment with condylox gel and not one wart has has gotten smaller or gone away!  I understand the gel can be used up to four weeks_ but I have a feeling it's not going to work. I experienced awful burning_ itching and slight bleeding. I also noticed the treated area turned white during and 1 or 2 days after treatment. I used aldara before and recommend it 100% over condylox gel. My warts went away within 2 treatment weeks and I didn't experience any side effects.,F,23,3  weeks,6/10/2006,Condylox
189, 1, HPV-Genital Warts,A very painful chemical burn on the head of my penis which took weeks to heal. Inflammation_ severe skin irritation. See my comments about freezing warts off_ which usually eliminates them in one relatively simple procedure_ with minimal pain. If possible_ opt for that rather than using condylox.,Condylox takes a long time to eliminate warts_ and you need to be extremely careful when you apply it. I ended up having the warts frozen off in a simple procedure at my dermatologist's office. I wish I had done this initially_ and never used condylox. Ask your physician about freezing warts off_ depending on their location.,M,27, ,3/18/2006,Condylox
190, 5, genital warts,burning_ itching,after only one application cycle the wart eroded and nearly disappeared. my doctor advised me to use the solution only 2 times a week.this contradicts the normal regimin_ but it seemed to work.however_ he did prescribe vaseline to use around the area of the wart to prvent the solution from making contact with non-affected areas. i recommend this highly.most important: allow the solution/gel to dry before allowing the treated area to contact unaffected skin.,M,44,2  days,3/17/2006,Condylox
191, 3, genital warts,wow.. burning_ itching.. very intense!!! i was not warned about these side effects by my doctor_ and i too experienced the most awful pain ever!!! i cried every time i used it after the first day. what's worse_ is there is nothing to ease the pain. you have to walk around with a sore_ itchy gential area. by day 3_ i could no longer take the pain. when i wiped after peeing_ there were blood spots..,it seems to be working.. but i dont believe this is for internal use on females.. i couldnt imagine that pain!!!,F,22,3  days,2/14/2006,Condylox
192, 5, genital warts,Some burning and rawness_ but not too bad.  Not using day 3 of round one because it's kind of raw now and they're gone.,3 small warts that I've been embarrassed about... gone in 2 days.  Woohoo.,M,,2  days,12/18/2005,Condylox

195, 5, Genital Warts,Some burning,This is 1_000_000_000_000 times better than ALDARA. This gel is excellent...it cleared about 85% of my warts in the first application week. Thank god for Condylox Gel because Aldara is a horrible_ horrible medicine for genital warts! Take this instead! I promise that you will not have to go through the hell I did when I was on Aldara.
