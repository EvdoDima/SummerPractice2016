0, 1, Knee osteoarthritis,I am 56 years old. I have knee osteoarthritis. Together with my first dose of Synavisc injection my doctor gave me Fosamax Plus.I was fine for the first 24 hours. When I woke up on the second day_ I had severe squeezing chest pain. I could not lift my arms. I thought I was having a heart attack and rushed to the hospital. After ruling out heart attack_ my doctor suspected esophagitis and treated me for that.  After 4 hours there was a little relief but then in addition to the chest pain_ I had severe pain in my rib cage and my thoracic back. Turning to the sides_ lifting arms and walking were very painful. I was slouching my shoulders in pain. Now it is the third day. My pain has reduced but not fully gone. This pain gave me a glimpse of my thoracic skeletal structure!! I would never want to take this medicine again.,It may be true that this drug may be good in certain conditions. However the patient must be fully informed of the consequences and be monitored closely by the Doctor if it is really required to be treated with this drug. As for me_ never again!,M,56,1  days70 mg 1X D,6/14/2013Email,Fosamax plus d
1, 1, osteopenia / osteoporosis,Jaw pain_ fever_ muscle aches,Vitamin D_ calcium and exercise will help you build bones_ not this poison.  Doctors just want to get women in the bone density test rat maze.  These tests prove nothing.  Don't be sucked in!!  Doctors just want to make money and get kick backs from the drug companies.  They know absolutely nothing about diet and nutrition.  They are drug pushers!!,F,53,1  days 1X D,6/2/2010,Fosamax plus d
