8, 4, Shingles,I was on Valtrex for 3 days but I could hardly urinate_ if at all. Also had constipation. I also thought I was going to jump out of my skin--unbearable jitteriness. I was switched to Famvir. It is much easier to tolerate. No problems urinating! A little jittery_ some brief heart palpatations_ and some headache but it's nothing I can't stand for a week. I just think these anti-virals are heavy duty drugs. Famvir seems to be a different class than Valtrex and Zovirax so if you can't stand one group try the other. Both drugs dried up the shingles.,,F,43,7  days500 3x day,12/20/2011Email,Famvir
9, 1, shingles,First time I had severe shingles and started taking Famvir. On the 5th day I began to feel extremely disoriented and shaky. Took my BP which was very high and my pulse was close to 200. I drove myself to the hospital and stayed there for several hours while I experienced several episodes of atrial fibrillation. I was given intravenous salt solution and some pills under the tongue. Then I was released but had another atrial fibrillation episode again the next day and went again to the emergency. It was less severe. I did not finish the prescription and have not had any heart problems since then. This all happened 4 and a half years ago.,,M,72,5  days500 3X D,10/16/2010,Famvir
10, 5, ,Mild headache has been my ONLY side effect.  Controlled best by one naproxin taken along with one famvir_ as they last about the same length of time.,I am so grateful for this medication.  I had recurring shingles until I started this medication.  Full workup and specialised tests revealed no known cause whatsoever.  It was surmised that I may have been born with a low-normal immune system.  I tried to go off the medicine for a month or more so that I could try the shingles vaccine; but after just three days I got shingles again.  So I am back on famvir and may just need to take it for life.  Are there any long-term negative effects to watch out for?  NOTE: I am interested to know whether others who are susceptible to shingles had a particularly strong case of chicken pox as a child.  Mine came at age 2 1/2 concurrent with measles!  My fever spiked to 106F_ I had a febrile seizure and went into a 3 hour coma which included a near-death experience.  Is there any chance this severity is why I get the shingles so easily now?,F,54,8  years250mg 2X D,6/7/2010,Famvir

12, 1, herpes,fatigue_ headache_ fuzzy head_ spots and vesicles on body and mouth ulcers.  Worse than herpes.  I don't take any other medications so it was not an interaction.  Horrible medicine.,Famvir has put me right off seeking help for herpes.  I will just plod along and treat it as I have always done with betadine solution.,F,64,4  days250 mg 2X D,3/11/2010,Famvir
13, 5, Cold Sores,Headache (mild_ brief)_ sometimes vertigo (mild),I just had a major victory with Famvir_ I felt the 'tingle' stage of a cold sore coming on and- per Dr's prescription- took a single dose of 3 pills.

14, 4, herpes,I am diabetic and my blood sugar soars the entire time I am on this medication.  The amount of insulin I need to control my blood sugar levels is easily four times what I would normally take.,However_ this medication does work well.  If I take it at the first sign of tingling I can avoid the outbreak all together.

16, 5, genetal herpes,a constant_ mild_ headache. No outbreaks since taking 250 mg twice a day. Twice a day works better than one 500 per day.

Not wanting to get off it as it is wonderful not to have outbreaks again.,F,50,7  years,6/17/2008,Famvir

After that_ I expreienced all kinds of weird aches and pains that I wrote off as ""getting older"". Then things got really bad_ and took Valtrex at 3G per day. It fixed all my pains_ but made me feel sick.  Switched to 500mg famvir twice daily_ and it keeps all those pains at bay.  Very expensive even with insurance until this year when they released a generic.  Now it is fully covered by my insurance.",M,38,2  years,5/1/2008,Famvir
18, 5, Oral outbreaks,None that I am aware of.  After 7 years I am wondering what the long term impacts on my health are.

22, 1, anti-viral pre-surgery,"Although my Dr. said I was an ""ultra-rare"" case_ it caused my red blood cells to break up and force me into severe anemia.
