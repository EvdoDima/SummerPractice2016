0, 1, Not now,Stopped taking Arava after 2 weeks. I have not been able to control the diarrhea since stopping this drug. Lomotil has only helped a little bit. Wish I had never taken this drug. I've had diarrhea for 3 weeks now My doctor prescribed this because I had swelling on ONE finger joint. It is a very aggressive drug. I would advise not taking it.,,M,76,14  days10mg 1X D,7/5/2016,Arava
1, 4, RA,I'm good with Arava. It's the cost of it lately that has caused me not to take it everyday_ so my soreness could be due to that or just because I have RA.,,F,52,10  years20mg 1X D,5/19/2016,Arava
2, 4, Ra,Didn't notice any side effects,Was bedridden for months when first diagnosed with ra. Plaque nil was useless and methotrexate caused severe nausea. Very happy with arava results but now I've stopped due to concerns with messed up immune system,F,43,10  years20mg daily,4/10/2016,Arava
3, 1, ,diarrhea and stomach pains,I took ARAVA prescribed by my rheumatologist after taking for over 2 months methrotaxate which was awful with bad side effects. Then after starting ARAVA more side effects and I stopped. But it's been over 2 months and I am still getting the runs_ I mean diarrhea and often accompanied by stomach pains.,F,,  1X D,3/31/2016,Arava
4, 1, RA,major hair loss but worse it trashed my liver. Ended up in the hospital with doctor talking about a liver transplant if things didn't get better. Luckily it has started to heal but I have to take another drug to flush this stuff out of my system. I can't afford these bills.,,F,63,1  years20 1X D,3/15/2016,Arava

6, 4, psoriatic arthritis,Initially no side effects though it did take a long time to start working. In September_ I had a flare - right knee and right pointer toe (sausage toe - excruciatingly painful). The toe calmed down after 24 hours but the knee was not helped in any way_ I had to get a steroid shot in it in December. Also in September_ my toes first_ and then the rest of the feet_ started a tingling/burning sensation and some numbness. I couldn't even touch them. By mid-December_ I was done - informed the doc of the foot issue when I got the knee shot. So I'm done taking leflunomide and back to methotrexate (which I quit before because it makes me so tired).,,F,55,7.5  months20mg 1X D,12/23/2015Email,Arava
7, 1, RA,"6 hours after taking the very first 10mg tablet_ I was trembling to the point my teeth were chattering and I was feeling very unwell. Ambulance was called and all vitals were out of wack so off to emergency. Released when stabilizedafter 6 hours in emergency. 5 hours later I was shaking worse_ was uncoordinated and unresponsive to next ambo team. This time I was hospitalized 2 days till everything stabilized.  Extensive tests determined no infection but a side effect stated as ""flue like symptons!""",Cannot beleive they suggest 3 days on 100mg then 10mg after that.

8, 3, RA/Lupus,I have been taking Arava going on four months now.  I noticed immediately the change in bowel habits.  I like this however due to how severely constipated I usually am.  I actually feel like I go like a noreal person now.  I'm starting to notice a bit of hairloss.  Not a lot but concerned it could get worse.  Im curious of anyones experience with the hairloss part of it.  No other side effects so far.  I still have joint pain.,,F,43,1  days20,12/9/2015,Arava

10, 5, RA,Intermittent diarrhea - sometimes mild_ sometimes severe.  The other 2/3 of the time no problems.  No hair loss. Mild appetite suppression. No itching. No rash.  Labs are normal so far.  I have a nasty cold right now that doesn't seem to want to go away - no one else is sick in my house. Not sure if it's a coincidence or from the arava suppressing my immune system.,I have been on Plaquenil_ stopped due to unrelenting itching. Methotrexate oral and SQ_ stopped due to extreme fatigue and nausea. Imuran_ stopped due to allergic reaction sudden onset fever_ nephritis_ elevated LFTs.  Cyclosporine_ stopped due to angioedema_ rash_ itching.  Humira_ no side effects but developed large lymph nodes and was concerned. Prednisone_ I limit taking due to already having osteopenia from use. So far on Arava I'm no longer fatigued.  Joint swelling and stiffness is much improved. Have had two small flares in a two month period but seem to be self limiting. I've been able to more consistently exercise- walk dogs_ walk on treadmill_ ride horse. Able to more reliably do things around house and yard. Generally feeling more energetic and not so run down from being sore all the time. I actually have days when I don't even think about my RA now. It's been a couple years since I could say that.,F,47,2  months20 mg,9/18/2015,Arava

14, 2, RA,Horrible sun sensitivity. To the point my skin hurt after mowing and ended up with little red raised itchy spots all over. I never put 2 and 2 together_ but I have also had the diarrhea others have mentioned for the last 2 years. In the last 2 months_ my joint and muscles have not felt as good and I have had absolutely HORRIFIC hair loss. Lose much more and I will have to get a pixie cut and look like I have mange it is so bad. I emailed my doctor today and told him I'm not taking it anymore. Honestly_ I felt better taking just plaquenil and prednisone for years. Disgusted at rheumatologic therapies. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to post today.

PA pain under control and felt great for 21 days. Then acute diarrhea.  I couldn't leave the house.  Urgent care doctor put me on 2 doses of strong antibiotics no relief. I finally made the connection with arava/leflunamide. I have been advised to stop taking it.  That was yesterday.  Diarrhea is still acute.

21, 1, RA,Hair loss started right away.  And chest pains and blood pressure was very high.  My rheumatologist never told me about the bad side affects.  Make sure you know how bad you can feel on this medication.  I finally went off of it when I was getting very sharp pains in my chest like I was being stabbed.  My blood pressure was high.  My primary care physician told me to get off of the drug because of the high blood pressure and chest pains.  My rheumatologist said my hair loss would stop when I stopped taking the leflunomide and I should see a dermatologist if my hair loss was still a problem.  He sure is not very knowledgeable about it staying in your system for up to 2 years.  Got  a new rheumatologist.  He said it does stay in your system up to 2 years.  You have to be your own advocate for your health.,,F,59,5  months20mg 1X D,12/1/2014,Arava

23, 2, RA,,I got off all drugs and apple cider vinegar worked for 3 years. After a flare up nothing worked for long and I had to change my diet; no white rice or bread. I find the best treatment is physical therapy with cold and hot water bathing and some rub on creams with arthritic gloves for the night.

Took for 3 more days and then just had to stop it.  After 3 days off side effects are going away and first noticable was sweating and headache thank god.,I have been on just about everything and methatrexate started to make me feel sicker then usual after 12 yrs on it.  Very strange that I started to suffer all of the worse side effects after so long.  So then the PA said_ OH LETS try Arava_ wihtout telling me anything about these horrible side effects I now read about.  This is insane to take this medication as I have felt I was dying and I still do not feel well at all.  I am still on Humera but now hesitate to take this weeks dosage.  Anyone is free to contact me about this drug or any other RA information.  Do I have to take that other drug to get 7 days of Arava out of my system???,F,54,7  days10 1X D,10/21/2014Email,Arava

Headaches and cysts in my face followed.  I literally have a small hole in my cheek one was so deep.  I had bug bites on my legs that grew into what looked like eczema and needed a week or two of rx hydrocortisone to heal.  I had a chronic yeast infection-not sure if related_ that took numerous OTC treatments_ diflucan and finally resorted to coconut oil to control it.  I stopped the drug and my hair continues to fall out_ and now I am starting to itch all over and am nauseous with cramping.  I plan to do the wash out-not sure what is worse the side effects_ especially the hair loss_ or the stress from all this. I have lost at least half the hair on my head_ and it is to the point that I am afraid to brush my hair as I blow dry it as it pulls so much out.

27, 1, RA,I took this approximately ten hours ago for the first time ever.  I immediately felt nauseous which subsided somewhat after eating.  I then began feeling anxious for some reason and then came the nonstop itching.  I can't seem to stop.  My throat itches_ my neck itches_ my scalp itches_ my torso itches.  I should have been to sleep three hours ago_ and have had no relief from the itching two hours post-benadryl.   I hate this drug. I can't imagine what it is doing to my organs.,I was diagnosed with RA a year ago.  Fortunately_ I worked at my job for 21 years and received STD and LTD until my SSD was approved.  What a ride.  I have tried methotrexate_ Plaquenil_ prednisone_ Humira.  The drugs for this disease have caused me to be so sick at times I thought I would die.  The worst was the methotrexate cough that turned into bronchitis.  I literally laid in bed for five weeks taking monstrous antibiotics which seemed to make me more sick.  I have a bad feeling about this Arava and will be calling my rheumatologist in the morning to report the annoying itching and anxiousness.

I stopped the drug a month ago and my hair's still coming out in clumps (even though I've been taking 10mg biotin_ 3mg folic acid_ and using Rogaine every day). I started the cholestyramine wash-out a few days ago. Still losing hair in clumps_ worried about bald spots on otherwise waist length hair. Arava made me lethargic_ the cholestyramine's not slowing the hair loss yet_ but it's making me sick and I'm missing work because of this.

My PCP said that Arava made the inflammation in my sinuses worse and probably made vascular inflammation worse. Got off it asap.,I understand the drug stays in your system for two entire years.

45, 4, mixed connective tissue diseases,I was excited over the weight loss as I need to lose a lot. However_ after losing 61 lbs. I have now started to gain rapidly (over 5 lbs. in one week). I am so bummed because I do not want to gain it all back.It seems to have lowered my sed rate. I have also lowered my prednisone but since prednisone actually helps me LOSE weight and feel so much better I don't see that as a good thing. Prednisone has always been my friend.

I ended up in the hospital on IV antibiotics for 6 days.  I have since resumed the Arava_ and now I am noticing quite a bit of hair loss.  Most recently_ I have discovered that it is making me very itchy.  I have stopped it and restarted it twice_ due to the pneumonia.  Each time I restart it_ within a few days_ I become very itchy again.  It is literally from head to toe_ but there is no rash that I can see.  I was previously on MTX_ which was helping_ but I was diagnosed with liver disease and am unable to take MTX at this point in time.  However_ given these new side effects_ I may talk to my rheumatologist about switching back to MTX.

58, 4, RA,Initially_ I experienced reduction in the severity and length of flair-ups with the help of steroids.  After 6 months_ hair started falling out in handfuls_ numbness in balls of feet and toes_ rash under the arms. Also_ weight gain from intermittent steroid use. Dermatologist cured rash_ Rheumatologist recommended folic acid for hair loss (taking 2400 MCG per day to stop hair loss).  Still have numbness in feet that is tolerable.  Blood sugar has slowly creeped up along with cholesterol and am borderline diabetic. I moderate diet by almost eliminating red meat and sugar.  Eating more salmon and chicken and eliminating wheat helps. I also take ibuprofen and Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg when i sense the occasional flair-up coming to reduce symptoms.  If the flair is severe_ I have to add a dose of steroids_ too.,Early on_ my rheumatologist recommended a dose of MTX with Arava.  I could not tolerate it_ so have managed to moderate my RA for years with Arava only.  I go through spurts of fair ups and then nothing for months.  I guess you could call me lucky that I don't experience some of the more drastic counter interactions of this drug.  I wish i could be off of Arava indefinitely but am glad that it has brought my symptoms somewhat under control. I am investigating taking an Indian homeopathic called Zyflamend recommended by a doctor to reduce inflammation. Have not tried this yet.,F,65,8  years20 1X D,10/14/2012Email,Arava
59, 4, Inflamatory Arthritis,Loose stools but knee now much better. Started Avara after 12 years on methotrexate_ this used to knock me for six once a week and had ceased to be affective.,So far so good_ 3 weeks without metho and 3 weeks on Avara. Swelling has gone in knee_ aided by gym/physio exercise. Bloods all cleat_ exercise has kept blood pressure in the right range_ even managed to walk and play 18 holes of Golf for the first time in 4 months... fingers crossed it keeps working...,M,43,3  weeks20 1X D,10/10/2012Email,Arava
