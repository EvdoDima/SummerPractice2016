1, 1, insomnia from Seroquel withdrawal,NIghtmarish visions between wakefulness and sleeping combined with intense anxiety.  Swelling of feet and ankles-- water retention when I increased the dose from 50-100.,"It put me to sleep the first 4 nights very well_ then I started having massive anxiety (I think as drug built up in the system) every night right after I took it_ then it just stopped working to put me to sleep and my legs and ankles swelled from the water rentention!! Horrible drug.  Has BLACK BOX WARNING OF SUICIDE!! DON""T EVER MESS WITH THIS DRUG.  TOO MANY POSTS OF GOING MAD AFTER JUST ONE DOSE.",M,48,8  days50-100 1X D,3/19/2016Email,Desyrel
2, 1, Insomnia,Forgetfulness. Stomach pains.,This pill definitely put me too sleep. Quickly. A little too quick. Falling asleep would come out of nowhere. Even though it helped me sleep it scared me. While taking this the next day I would have stomach aches on and off. The worst part is I would forget everything about my day. I felt like I wasn't even there. Physically I was_ mentally I was gone. I felt like a zombie. It wasn't worth the sleep,F,19,3  months,11/19/2015Email,Desyrel

4, 2, Insomnia,Somnolence_ lethargy_ brain fog_ insomnia_ dry mouth_ headache,"Yuck.  I really don't like this medication.  The doctors put me on it to manage my insomnia_ as a ""safe"" alternative to ambien.  A medication that turns you into a zombie (the effects lasting well into the next day) does not seem safe to me.  The hangover is intolerable.  If you're taking this medication with another medication that also causes dry mouth_ watch out.  The dry mouth alone was enough to keep me up at night.  When I told the doctor it wasn't helping me fall asleep_ she recommended that I take more of it_ and when I did_ I was way too loopy to be able to fall asleep.  The day after taking it_ I'm tired_ apathetic_ and have difficulty concentrating.  I honestly don't understand how this could be seen as a superior sleep aid.",F,38,90  days25 mg 1X D,7/6/2015Email,Desyrel
5, 2, Fibromyalgia,Took at 10pm and slept soundly. Woke with body pain and grogginess. I was unable to function for most of the day due to brain fog and grogginess.,In all fairness_  my body overreacts to many types of medication.,F,75,1  days25mg,3/4/2015,Desyrel
6, 1, insomnia,I was prescribed this drug for insomnia but the side effects of this drug have made me far more miserable than sleepless nights do_ and now the side effects keep me awake anyway.  My nose is so congested that I'd like to fall on my sword_ my throat is super dry_ I've got an awful taste in my mouth that ruins my meals_ and honestly in two weeks time I've gained about 5 lbs without eating any more than normal.  I'm exhausted all day... in short_ give me back my insomnia_ I'm throwing this drug in the trash can!,,F,36,14  days50mg 1X D,12/15/2014,Desyrel
7, 5, Major depression,No side effects...have taken antidepressants for about 45 yrs..this is one of a very few that actually work with no weight gain or any other side effects..it makes sleep easier and anxieties are reduced,i love this med...don't hesitate to at least try it...I have taken pretty much every antidepressant available..this one WORKS.,F,66,90  days50 mg 1X D,11/29/2014Email,Desyrel
8, 3, Severe anxiety_ very minor insomnia,This really helped my anxiety_ but the side effects weren't worth it. It seemed to really change how I thought. While on it_ I didn't want to go out of my house (or my room) because the outside world seemed too scary_ I didn't want to do anything unpleasant_ like schoolwork_ exercising_ going outside my home_ and trying to function in life. I just wanted to live in a fantasy world inside my head_ because fantasy and obsession was much better than real life_ which (for me) was filled with anxiety and having too much anxiety to make friends or function like a healthy person. I also had weakness when trying to exercise_ I was eating bad foods because I felt scared while taking this med_ so gaining weight. Also_ this med and many others do get in the air_ so I felt like the people I live with (and my cat) were experiencing side effects of the med_ which for them would be sedation_ confusion_ weakness_ tiredness_ sleepiness.After 2 days I stopped taking it because of the unwanted side e,It was great for my severe anxiety. I felt my anxiety lift from me after I took it. But because of the unpleasant side effects_ I have chosen to stop taking it after only two days. The same thing happened to me when I was on Wellbutrin- I didn't want to experience anything unpleasant_ so I stopped going to classes and dropped out of college_ and I just hid in my room and went online on the computer and lived in a fantasy world_ obsessing over attractive male celebrities. I had very little insomnia_ if anything at all_ because I was being taken off of Seroquel XR (which is very sedating). So I didn't really use it for insomnia.,F,31,2  days50 mg 1X D,10/2/2014Email,Desyrel
9, 3, Depression Insomnia,drowsiness,This drug makes me fall asleep but it won't really keep you asleep all night. Doxepin is better for that. Antidepressant effect is very mild if any at all.,M,50,2  weeks50 2X D,9/30/2014Email,Desyrel
10, 3, Insomnia and Depression,Morning drowsiness_ dizziness_ fatigue_ headache_ dry mouth.,I was prescribed desyrel in combination with Lyrica to treat both insomnia and Restless Leg Syndrome.  Desyrel on its own_ after taking at a dosage of 50 mg for one week_ showed little if any affect in resolving my insomnia.  After week 2_ this drug began to allow at least 4 hours of sleep a night 50% of the time_ and at week 3 the desyrel was working to allow 5 hours of sleep at 75% of the time.  By week 4_ I have experienced at least 6-7 hours of sleep at 85-90%; however_ I recently experienced a setback due to emotional stress_ lack of physical activity_ which gives now casts doubt on my belief that this drug would work optimally to produce sleep irregardless of the amount of emotional stress or lack of physical activity that I would encounter in what I would call a typical day.  I will very likely seek to have the dosage raised to 100 mg this next week_ if the insomnia does continue to break 'remission'.,F,49,4  weeks50 1X D,6/4/2014,Desyrel

12, 1, Depression,My doctor wanted me to take this at bedtime because it makes you very sleepy_ and since I am the mother of 2 young children I don't need to be drowsy during the day. Right after I took the pill I felt very dizzy and weird. I fell asleep. When I woke up the next morning_ I walked into the bathroom to brush my teeth and suddenly felt very faint. I collapsed on the floor and broke out in a cold sweat from head to toe. I felt intense nausea and dizziness. I tried to get my phone off the bed but I felt so weak I couldn't move. This lasted for a good 10 min until I decided to gag myself to relieve the nausea. After that it slowly wore  off and I was able to stand and get to my kids. I let the Dr. Know what happened_ and she told me to stop taking it_ well duh! I believe it was ortho static hypotension_ and I know this is one side effects of this medication. So if you have low blood pressure to begin with as I do_ I would not recommend this drug.,,F,26,1  days100mg q hs,1/25/2014,Desyrel

14, 4, Insomnia_ trouble falling asleep,At higher doses ,I have taken this medication for six years and it is very difficult to stop taking it. I was taking a dosage of 75 in the beginning but it was way too much. Try to take the smallest dose possible_ even 15 milligrams can put most people to sleep and you won't build a tolerance. I DID gain weight on this medication_ as I cut the dosage_ I lost weight. I gained weight without even really increasing my calories. This medication also makes me very slow and groggy in the morning_ but not as bad as some other sleep medications. It has caused chronic constipation for me_ no matter the dose. If I don't take this medication_ I do not sleep. I am down to 15 mil per night and I will wean down as far as possible until I am off. I recommend avoiding any sleep aid if possible. I have had lifetime sleep issues but sleeping pills are not the answer_ I can say that after 30 years. A once-in-a-while fix_ is okay_ but don't get yourself on them every night. It's a trap.,F,38,6  years25 1X D,10/2/2013Email,Desyrel

16, 2, sleep aid,Added anxiety_ nauseous_ diarrhea_ dry mouth_ horrific nightmares_ sleep paralysis_ obsessive thoughts. I went to the doctor 7 years ago because of panic attacks. I was told that I'm bipolar among many other things. The attacks became severe AFTER starting medication. Did research. It was the added AD medication. Paxil then Prozac. Why are drs mixing these?!?

18, 4, Depression and agitation,Weight gain - extreme appetite - dryness of mouth. Don't bother telling the psychiatrists about the weight gain - they'll only write down 'patient refuses to accept medication does not affect her weight.' But_ once I halved the dosage_ I lost 20 pounds.,Good for those who are depressed and agitated_ but probably too sedating for those who are depressed and lethargic. It greatly reduced my insomnia_ which was a godsend.,F,55,17  years150 1X D,3/9/2013,Desyrel
19, 1, Insomnia/frequent waking,I had a SEVERELY horrible reaction. 30 mins after taking I began to feel dissociative and oddly impulsive. Despite this being a sleep med_ I became extremely restless and decided to go for a drive (bad idea). I was so removed that my driving was very erratic. I made it back to my house_ and began to feel more and more crazy_ like I wasn't in my body. I heard voices telling me to kill myself. I was sweating profusely and shaking. Didn't sleep at ALL. These effects lasted at least five or six hours.,Never taking this again. I know of some people who have loved this med_ but for some reason it made me go crazy!,F,22,1  days50 mg 1X D,10/19/2012,Desyrel

Mentally I'm up but my body felt dead. Anger heightened_ irritability_ experienced. Got off of bc like two days of taking_ hear rate increased (racing fast) and tremors.

Otherwise_ it literally takes 3+ hrs to fall asleep .BUT I am wondering now if it's the cause of this weird brain fog feeling I have. All the time  all my brain wants to do is zone out and stare.

22, 1, Insomnia,SINUS CONGESTION,How can you sleep when this medication causes_ for some people_ complete SINUS CONGESTION? I didnt have this problem when I took it years ago_ then it snuck up on me_ within 1 hours of traking Trazodone my Sinuses completely SWELLED SHUT like I had a terrible cause of Sinusitis. Is there any way to get around this sinus congestion? If you are predisposed already to nasal allergies and some nighttime nasal stuffiness_ Trazodone probably will make it much worse.

23, 1, Insomnia,I felt drunk_ the first evening I took one. I felt groggy the next day & absent-minded. Didn't help with the insomnia either_ instead of waking up at 4am_ woke up at 5am_ not much improvement there. Felt nauseous most of the time_ had bouts of diahrrea & had strange metallic taste in my mouth.After a few days I  noticed oppression ( like when about to hyperventilate )  when breathing that made me irritable. I tried to though it out but nothing improved. On the 11th day decided to cut down to 25mg_ not much changed so eventually I discontinued. Had the worst withdrawal side effects in my life_ and in the past I had withdrawn from other AD without horrible side effects. The first two days of withdrawals were hellish - I had vertigo_ felt restless_ had constant nausea but unable to vomit_ my heart was racing & was shaking like a leaf_ I had debilitating headaches and backaches_ felt like I was on the verge of a full blown panic attack. I tried to lie down but when I did_ I f,This old AD should be discontinued as I believe there are surely better alternatives to this drug.,F,49,12  days50 MG 1X D,5/15/2012Email,Desyrel
24, 4, restlessness_ and could not sleep,I experienced no side effects_ other then tonight. I did not get ir take my meds tonight ( trazadone and cipralex) due to my fm not putting them out for me and in return I cannot sleep. But_ every other night when I take my 25mgs of trazadone with my other med i can sleep like a baby_ with no interuptions in my sleep and wake up feeling refreshed and ready for the day. A lot of reviews i see on here are by people who have only taken them for 1 day - 2 weeks and id just like to say there are things you have to deal with when you are putting a new drug into your system. You need to allow your body time to adjust to the new chemicals or hormones and sometimes the first couple weeks are rough... but don't put the drug down if you really haven't given it a proper shot.,,F,17,2  months25mg,4/5/2012,Desyrel

I took this drug for years and it did work for sleep_ but not without side effects. However_ when I last tried it I got a generic made by PLIVA aka TEVA  pharma and it had the opposite effect on me! I see another poster said that Pliva Trazodone did not work for insomnia either_ it seems like a totally different drug.  So_ does anyone know what generic would work for insomnia? I believe the one I took years ago is off the market now (it had little divider marks in the pill to split it).

33, 1, Insomnia,Tremor_ awkward movement_ dizziness_ dry mouth_ lost words_ unable to focus.,The doctor prescribed this for insomnia.  This is one drug that I have had every bad side effect a person could have.  After an MRI to determine what could be the cause of the tremors_ I figured out on my own that it was probably this drug.  I feel silly for not connecting the two_ but I have a lot of pain with RA_ and initially I assumed the side effects were a flare-up.  I know everyone will react differently to meds so I'm not warning anyone away.  I just think there has to be drugs out there that don't have all these side effects.

It took 2 months for me to relaize that the new problems I was experiencing were related to the drug.  I've been off of trazadone for over 1 month now. The congestion  and blurred vision totally cleared up.  I'm still having problems with constipation.  I'm 41 years old and never had a problem having orgasms.  I almost lost the ability all together while on this drug. I know it sounds crazy but I have no doubt it was from the trazadone.

55, 4, Insomnia,I have taken this for at least 4 years during the last two years I have noticed I have had foot and ankle swelling and some blood vessels showing up there.  I also take Ropinirol and Gabapentin for Restless leg and Prilosec for Reflux (GERD) I am thinking this condition might be related to my Trazodone but am not sure.,I once tried to go off Desyrel but found as soon as I cut back i could not sleep and felt nervous.  So I am now going to discontinue Desyrel by cutting back over 8 weeks I have divided the pills into quarters and every two weeks decrease it by 1/4  and the last two weeks I plan on just taking the 1/4 tab every other day.  So far this seem t0 be working I have just started my 1/4 tab and am still sleeping.  I have discussed this with MD and likes this rate of stopping.,M,56,4  years50 1X D,9/19/2010Email,Desyrel
56, 1, Insomnia,The first time I took it about 15 minutes later I had an overwhelming fear that I was not going to wake up.  I even called my husband at work and told him to come home and check on me on his break.  I went to sleep quickly and had horrible nightmares and kept waking up gasping for air but I couldn't hold my eyes open.  I finally somehow forced myself to get up and go get in a cool shower trying to calm down and I had a full blown panic attack and for some reason kept thinking I was going to suffocate (when I was breathing just fine).  My husband did come home and said I was wild eyed.  I called the doc and he said I had to take it for a week and I would adjust to the medication slowly.  I took his word for it and regretted it.  The symptoms stayed generally the same but the last night I took it I was unable to sleep even though I was so drunk and sleepy I could barely hold my head up.  I was too paranoid and was sure I was going to stop breathing.  I was hallucinating while awake and h,I think there are better options for insomnia and would not recommend this medication to anyone.  I've heard only bad things about it as well and I've made sure to tell anyone that would listen not to take this.  I even made my doctor mad when I refused to take it anymore.  He wouldn't prescribe anything else for me for insomnia!,F,31,3  days? 1X D,9/17/2010,Desyrel
57, 3, Insomnia_ Depression,NAUSEA NAUSEA NAUSEA_ vomiting_ diarreah_ groginess.,I am sure Trazodone helps SOME people because I took it as a child and had little to no side effects. (At a much lower dose). When I started taking it again_ I went from 50 mg to 100 mg in a few days.  Once I switched to 100 mg everything went downhill. EXTREME NAUSEA and vomiting each and every morning. Groginess throughout the day was frustrating_ but the groginess in the A.M. was the worst. Took me nearly 2-3 hours before I even felt slightly awake and functionable. If you have a weak stomach I would advise you to stay away from this drug.  But if you can hanedle the nausea you might be alright. 50 mg didn't help me sleep at all. 100 mg helped better_ but for me_ the side effects were not worth it.  Everyone responds differently however so I would suggest at least trying it if you need help with sleeping. Good luck!,F,27,2  weeks100 mg 1X D,9/14/2010,Desyrel
58, 1, severe insomnia,"While on a course of Amoxicillin_ my doctor prescribed the trazodone because I had severe insomnia.  I took only 50 mg at 9:00 pm.  At first_ I felt this weird ""rush"" coming over my body_ and it went away.  At midnight_ I started to feel really out of it_ and mad.  Then_ at 1:00 am I was stark raving mad; an absolute lunatic who wanted to commit suicide.I DID sleep_ but the next day all day_ I was very exhausted_ and I was a zombie.",Well_ I think that it looks like Tom Cruise is right on this one.   Don't f with head meds.Too high of a price.,F,41,1  times50 1X D,9/5/2010Email,Desyrel
59, 1, Depression_ Anxiety,Congestion_ drowsiness_ hypotension_ dizziness_ sedation_ cognitive impairment_ memory loss,A useless anxiolytic and antidepressant_ unless you consider sleeping 16 hours a day therapeutic. I can see the merit of a low dose PM for SERIOUS insomnia but anything higher than 75mg will turn you into a zombie based on my experience - and I'm about as easy to sedate as an elephant.,M,27,40  days300mg 1X D,8/31/2010Email,Desyrel
