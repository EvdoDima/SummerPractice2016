1, 1, insomnia from Seroquel withdrawal,NIghtmarish visions between wakefulness and sleeping combined with intense anxiety.  Swelling of feet and ankles-- water retention when I increased the dose from 50-100.,"It put me to sleep the first 4 nights very well_ then I started having massive anxiety (I think as drug built up in the system) every night right after I took it_ then it just stopped working to put me to sleep and my legs and ankles swelled from the water rentention!! Horrible drug.  Has BLACK BOX WARNING OF SUICIDE!! DON""T EVER MESS WITH THIS DRUG.  TOO MANY POSTS OF GOING MAD AFTER JUST ONE DOSE.",M,48,8  days50-100 1X D,3/19/2016Email,Desyrel
2, 1, Insomnia,Forgetfulness. Stomach pains.,This pill definitely put me too sleep. Quickly. A little too quick. Falling asleep would come out of nowhere. Even though it helped me sleep it scared me. While taking this the next day I would have stomach aches on and off. The worst part is I would forget everything about my day. I felt like I wasn't even there. Physically I was_ mentally I was gone. I felt like a zombie. It wasn't worth the sleep,F,19,3  months,11/19/2015Email,Desyrel

4, 2, Insomnia,Somnolence_ lethargy_ brain fog_ insomnia_ dry mouth_ headache,"Yuck.  I really don't like this medication.  The doctors put me on it to manage my insomnia_ as a ""safe"" alternative to ambien.  A medication that turns you into a zombie (the effects lasting well into the next day) does not seem safe to me.  The hangover is intolerable.  If you're taking this medication with another medication that also causes dry mouth_ watch out.  The dry mouth alone was enough to keep me up at night.  When I told the doctor it wasn't helping me fall asleep_ she recommended that I take more of it_ and when I did_ I was way too loopy to be able to fall asleep.  The day after taking it_ I'm tired_ apathetic_ and have difficulty concentrating.  I honestly don't understand how this could be seen as a superior sleep aid.",F,38,90  days25 mg 1X D,7/6/2015Email,Desyrel
5, 2, Fibromyalgia,Took at 10pm and slept soundly. Woke with body pain and grogginess. I was unable to function for most of the day due to brain fog and grogginess.,In all fairness_  my body overreacts to many types of medication.,F,75,1  days25mg,3/4/2015,Desyrel
6, 1, insomnia,I was prescribed this drug for insomnia but the side effects of this drug have made me far more miserable than sleepless nights do_ and now the side effects keep me awake anyway.  My nose is so congested that I'd like to fall on my sword_ my throat is super dry_ I've got an awful taste in my mouth that ruins my meals_ and honestly in two weeks time I've gained about 5 lbs without eating any more than normal.  I'm exhausted all day... in short_ give me back my insomnia_ I'm throwing this drug in the trash can!,,F,36,14  days50mg 1X D,12/15/2014,Desyrel
7, 5, Major depression,No side effects...have taken antidepressants for about 45 yrs..this is one of a very few that actually work with no weight gain or any other side effects..it makes sleep easier and anxieties are reduced,i love this med...don't hesitate to at least try it...I have taken pretty much every antidepressant available..this one WORKS.,F,66,90  days50 mg 1X D,11/29/2014Email,Desyrel
8, 3, Severe anxiety_ very minor insomnia,This really helped my anxiety_ but the side effects weren't worth it. It seemed to really change how I thought. While on it_ I didn't want to go out of my house (or my room) because the outside world seemed too scary_ I didn't want to do anything unpleasant_ like schoolwork_ exercising_ going outside my home_ and trying to function in life. I just wanted to live in a fantasy world inside my head_ because fantasy and obsession was much better than real life_ which (for me) was filled with anxiety and having too much anxiety to make friends or function like a healthy person. I also had weakness when trying to exercise_ I was eating bad foods because I felt scared while taking this med_ so gaining weight. Also_ this med and many others do get in the air_ so I felt like the people I live with (and my cat) were experiencing side effects of the med_ which for them would be sedation_ confusion_ weakness_ tiredness_ sleepiness.After 2 days I stopped taking it because of the unwanted side e,It was great for my severe anxiety. I felt my anxiety lift from me after I took it. But because of the unpleasant side effects_ I have chosen to stop taking it after only two days. The same thing happened to me when I was on Wellbutrin- I didn't want to experience anything unpleasant_ so I stopped going to classes and dropped out of college_ and I just hid in my room and went online on the computer and lived in a fantasy world_ obsessing over attractive male celebrities. I had very little insomnia_ if anything at all_ because I was being taken off of Seroquel XR (which is very sedating). So I didn't really use it for insomnia.,F,31,2  days50 mg 1X D,10/2/2014Email,Desyrel
9, 3, Depression Insomnia,drowsiness,This drug makes me fall asleep but it won't really keep you asleep all night. Doxepin is better for that. Antidepressant effect is very mild if any at all.,M,50,2  weeks50 2X D,9/30/2014Email,Desyrel
10, 3, Insomnia and Depression,Morning drowsiness_ dizziness_ fatigue_ headache_ dry mouth.,I was prescribed desyrel in combination with Lyrica to treat both insomnia and Restless Leg Syndrome.  Desyrel on its own_ after taking at a dosage of 50 mg for one week_ showed little if any affect in resolving my insomnia.  After week 2_ this drug began to allow at least 4 hours of sleep a night 50% of the time_ and at week 3 the desyrel was working to allow 5 hours of sleep at 75% of the time.  By week 4_ I have experienced at least 6-7 hours of sleep at 85-90%; however_ I recently experienced a setback due to emotional stress_ lack of physical activity_ which gives now casts doubt on my belief that this drug would work optimally to produce sleep irregardless of the amount of emotional stress or lack of physical activity that I would encounter in what I would call a typical day.  I will very likely seek to have the dosage raised to 100 mg this next week_ if the insomnia does continue to break 'remission'.,F,49,4  weeks50 1X D,6/4/2014,Desyrel

12, 1, Depression,My doctor wanted me to take this at bedtime because it makes you very sleepy_ and since I am the mother of 2 young children I don't need to be drowsy during the day. Right after I took the pill I felt very dizzy and weird. I fell asleep. When I woke up the next morning_ I walked into the bathroom to brush my teeth and suddenly felt very faint. I collapsed on the floor and broke out in a cold sweat from head to toe. I felt intense nausea and dizziness. I tried to get my phone off the bed but I felt so weak I couldn't move. This lasted for a good 10 min until I decided to gag myself to relieve the nausea. After that it slowly wore  off and I was able to stand and get to my kids. I let the Dr. Know what happened_ and she told me to stop taking it_ well duh! I believe it was ortho static hypotension_ and I know this is one side effects of this medication. So if you have low blood pressure to begin with as I do_ I would not recommend this drug.,,F,26,1  days100mg q hs,1/25/2014,Desyrel

14, 4, Insomnia_ trouble falling asleep,At higher doses ,I have taken this medication for six years and it is very difficult to stop taking it. I was taking a dosage of 75 in the beginning but it was way too much. Try to take the smallest dose possible_ even 15 milligrams can put most people to sleep and you won't build a tolerance. I DID gain weight on this medication_ as I cut the dosage_ I lost weight. I gained weight without even really increasing my calories. This medication also makes me very slow and groggy in the morning_ but not as bad as some other sleep medications. It has caused chronic constipation for me_ no matter the dose. If I don't take this medication_ I do not sleep. I am down to 15 mil per night and I will wean down as far as possible until I am off. I recommend avoiding any sleep aid if possible. I have had lifetime sleep issues but sleeping pills are not the answer_ I can say that after 30 years. A once-in-a-while fix_ is okay_ but don't get yourself on them every night. It's a trap.,F,38,6  years25 1X D,10/2/2013Email,Desyrel

16, 2, sleep aid,Added anxiety_ nauseous_ diarrhea_ dry mouth_ horrific nightmares_ sleep paralysis_ obsessive thoughts. I went to the doctor 7 years ago because of panic attacks. I was told that I'm bipolar among many other things. The attacks became severe AFTER starting medication. Did research. It was the added AD medication. Paxil then Prozac. Why are drs mixing these?!?

18, 4, Depression and agitation,Weight gain - extreme appetite - dryness of mouth. Don't bother telling the psychiatrists about the weight gain - they'll only write down 'patient refuses to accept medication does not affect her weight.' But_ once I halved the dosage_ I lost 20 pounds.,Good for those who are depressed and agitated_ but probably too sedating for those who are depressed and lethargic. It greatly reduced my insomnia_ which was a godsend.,F,55,17  years150 1X D,3/9/2013,Desyrel
19, 1, Insomnia/frequent waking,I had a SEVERELY horrible reaction. 30 mins after taking I began to feel dissociative and oddly impulsive. Despite this being a sleep med_ I became extremely restless and decided to go for a drive (bad idea). I was so removed that my driving was very erratic. I made it back to my house_ and began to feel more and more crazy_ like I wasn't in my body. I heard voices telling me to kill myself. I was sweating profusely and shaking. Didn't sleep at ALL. These effects lasted at least five or six hours.,Never taking this again. I know of some people who have loved this med_ but for some reason it made me go crazy!,F,22,1  days50 mg 1X D,10/19/2012,Desyrel

Mentally I'm up but my body felt dead. Anger heightened_ irritability_ experienced. Got off of bc like two days of taking_ hear rate increased (racing fast) and tremors.

Otherwise_ it literally takes 3+ hrs to fall asleep .BUT I am wondering now if it's the cause of this weird brain fog feeling I have. All the time  all my brain wants to do is zone out and stare.

22, 1, Insomnia,SINUS CONGESTION,How can you sleep when this medication causes_ for some people_ complete SINUS CONGESTION? I didnt have this problem when I took it years ago_ then it snuck up on me_ within 1 hours of traking Trazodone my Sinuses completely SWELLED SHUT like I had a terrible cause of Sinusitis. Is there any way to get around this sinus congestion? If you are predisposed already to nasal allergies and some nighttime nasal stuffiness_ Trazodone probably will make it much worse.

23, 1, Insomnia,I felt drunk_ the first evening I took one. I felt groggy the next day & absent-minded. Didn't help with the insomnia either_ instead of waking up at 4am_ woke up at 5am_ not much improvement there. Felt nauseous most of the time_ had bouts of diahrrea & had strange metallic taste in my mouth.After a few days I  noticed oppression ( like when about to hyperventilate )  when breathing that made me irritable. I tried to though it out but nothing improved. On the 11th day decided to cut down to 25mg_ not much changed so eventually I discontinued. Had the worst withdrawal side effects in my life_ and in the past I had withdrawn from other AD without horrible side effects. The first two days of withdrawals were hellish - I had vertigo_ felt restless_ had constant nausea but unable to vomit_ my heart was racing & was shaking like a leaf_ I had debilitating headaches and backaches_ felt like I was on the verge of a full blown panic attack. I tried to lie down but when I did_ I f,This old AD should be discontinued as I believe there are surely better alternatives to this drug.,F,49,12  days50 MG 1X D,5/15/2012Email,Desyrel
24, 4, restlessness_ and could not sleep,I experienced no side effects_ other then tonight. I did not get ir take my meds tonight ( trazadone and cipralex) due to my fm not putting them out for me and in return I cannot sleep. But_ every other night when I take my 25mgs of trazadone with my other med i can sleep like a baby_ with no interuptions in my sleep and wake up feeling refreshed and ready for the day. A lot of reviews i see on here are by people who have only taken them for 1 day - 2 weeks and id just like to say there are things you have to deal with when you are putting a new drug into your system. You need to allow your body time to adjust to the new chemicals or hormones and sometimes the first couple weeks are rough... but don't put the drug down if you really haven't given it a proper shot.,,F,17,2  months25mg,4/5/2012,Desyrel

I took this drug for years and it did work for sleep_ but not without side effects. However_ when I last tried it I got a generic made by PLIVA aka TEVA  pharma and it had the opposite effect on me! I see another poster said that Pliva Trazodone did not work for insomnia either_ it seems like a totally different drug.  So_ does anyone know what generic would work for insomnia? I believe the one I took years ago is off the market now (it had little divider marks in the pill to split it).

33, 1, Insomnia,Tremor_ awkward movement_ dizziness_ dry mouth_ lost words_ unable to focus.,The doctor prescribed this for insomnia.  This is one drug that I have had every bad side effect a person could have.  After an MRI to determine what could be the cause of the tremors_ I figured out on my own that it was probably this drug.  I feel silly for not connecting the two_ but I have a lot of pain with RA_ and initially I assumed the side effects were a flare-up.  I know everyone will react differently to meds so I'm not warning anyone away.  I just think there has to be drugs out there that don't have all these side effects.

It took 2 months for me to relaize that the new problems I was experiencing were related to the drug.  I've been off of trazadone for over 1 month now. The congestion  and blurred vision totally cleared up.  I'm still having problems with constipation.  I'm 41 years old and never had a problem having orgasms.  I almost lost the ability all together while on this drug. I know it sounds crazy but I have no doubt it was from the trazadone.

56, 1, Insomnia,The first time I took it about 15 minutes later I had an overwhelming fear that I was not going to wake up.  I even called my husband at work and told him to come home and check on me on his break.  I went to sleep quickly and had horrible nightmares and kept waking up gasping for air but I couldn't hold my eyes open.  I finally somehow forced myself to get up and go get in a cool shower trying to calm down and I had a full blown panic attack and for some reason kept thinking I was going to suffocate (when I was breathing just fine).  My husband did come home and said I was wild eyed.  I called the doc and he said I had to take it for a week and I would adjust to the medication slowly.  I took his word for it and regretted it.  The symptoms stayed generally the same but the last night I took it I was unable to sleep even though I was so drunk and sleepy I could barely hold my head up.  I was too paranoid and was sure I was going to stop breathing.  I was hallucinating while awake and h,I think there are better options for insomnia and would not recommend this medication to anyone.  I've heard only bad things about it as well and I've made sure to tell anyone that would listen not to take this.  I even made my doctor mad when I refused to take it anymore.  He wouldn't prescribe anything else for me for insomnia!,F,31,3  days? 1X D,9/17/2010,Desyrel
57, 3, Insomnia_ Depression,NAUSEA NAUSEA NAUSEA_ vomiting_ diarreah_ groginess.,I am sure Trazodone helps SOME people because I took it as a child and had little to no side effects. (At a much lower dose). When I started taking it again_ I went from 50 mg to 100 mg in a few days.  Once I switched to 100 mg everything went downhill. EXTREME NAUSEA and vomiting each and every morning. Groginess throughout the day was frustrating_ but the groginess in the A.M. was the worst. Took me nearly 2-3 hours before I even felt slightly awake and functionable. If you have a weak stomach I would advise you to stay away from this drug.  But if you can hanedle the nausea you might be alright. 50 mg didn't help me sleep at all. 100 mg helped better_ but for me_ the side effects were not worth it.  Everyone responds differently however so I would suggest at least trying it if you need help with sleeping. Good luck!,F,27,2  weeks100 mg 1X D,9/14/2010,Desyrel

64, 1, Depression and insomnia,nose a bit stuffy (not bothersome)unwanted erectionsdizziness/off-balance feeling the whole next dayseizure when i missed a dose 1 night,Was added to my daily dose of Prozac (which I have taken for years) after new stressors in my life caused insomnia.  I read it was very commonly prescribed (an older drug)_ non-addictive_ fairly safe to try.  I took 50mg each night for 1 month.  It put me to sleep but the whole next day I would have the hang-over effect which totally interfered with my functioning. So I decided to stop it and not get a refill.  The next day I was a mess with high anxiety/panic/headaches (which I did not have before taking it).  I went to get the 1 refill I had available and I took half a pill (25mg) for 7 days and then stopped.  More than a week after I am still feeling off-balance and having terrible anxiety all day.  To top it all off I am finding it impossible to sleep at night which is MUCH worse than my original insomnia.  I wish I never took this damn drug to begin with...and I only took 30 full pills.  This led me to do more research on the web.  I found that prozac increases the plasma levels of trazodone (it inhibits a liver enzyme that breaks it down) .  Also traz works much differently at low dose (50mg) and higher doses(eg 300mg) and those on lower doses have more trouble getting off it.  And I have read countless withdrawal horrors and how people are tempted to keep taking it to avoid these awful symptoms.  I made a BIG mistake taking it - very nasty drug.,M,40,37  days50mg 1X D,7/18/2010Email,Desyrel

66, 4, insomnia,hair loss with Pliva brand,I'm just writing to say that there is a huge difference between brands of trazodone.  I was on Apotex the entire time until they had a problem with the FDA.  Then they switched me to the Pliva brand.  The Apotex brand totally agreed with me (and I actually think it made my hair grow) but it seems that once I started the Pliva brand my hair started falling out.  I don't think it's a coincidence but it could have been the stopping of the Apotex brand.  I stopped taking the Pliva brand and was able to get some Apotex until they are back on the US market.  My hair loss seems to be lessening. So side effects can vary widely depending on the brand.  I read on another site that a doctor will never recommend Pliva.  He thinks it's the worst brand of trazodone.,F,54,2  years50 mg. 1X D,6/14/2010,Desyrel

Horrible sick feeling for the first 5 days_ minimal appetite_ normal foods lost their appeal_ bad hang-over feeling_ had headache all day long. Very sick to stomach. Felt like a zombie. ( I think my dosage was too high ),For me on 100 mg a night it still takes me 2-3 hrs to fall asleep-which is frustrating because I think the dosage is a little too high for me. I take it 3 hrs before I want to fall asleep too negate the morning drowsiness- because it is tough- you can't get going- and I don't feel like eating anything or drinking coffee.

My anxiety and insomnia improved within the first week of starting the drug. Started with 50 mg. at bedtime for one week_ 75 mg for one week_ then ultimately 100 mg. At this dose I fall asleep when I go to bed_ sleep restfully all night_ fall back asleep easily if I do awaken through the night and wake up refreshed and rested in the morning. I would like to wean off the medication now after 3 months and am already having difficulty sleeping well after cutting back to 75 mg.

I only take it every other night or so to avoid side effects/addictions_ alternating with either Tylenol PM or nothing. My brother (both of us middle-aged)_ however_ who recommended this to me_ is knocked out immediately by his nightly dosage of 100 mg and swears by it for sleep. He also takes other meds_ though_ and that may make a big difference in people.

88, 3, Anxiety-related Insomnia (chronic),"""Shadowing"" of moving images (kind of like a strobe light)_ dry mouth_ hangover upon initially starting it (which did subside)_ aggrevation of Tourrette's related symptoms.",I was placed on Desyrel as an adjunct for severe major depression compounded with anxiety and sleeplessness. My psychiatrist was conservative in terms of prescribing any medication that could be of abuse as_ for a brief period in my life_ I was overdose on extremely high doses of dextromethorphan to help me sleep and generally try to 'escape'. This medicine was adjuncted with BuSpar at 60mg a day_ as well as 150mg of Zoloft per day. The immediate effects of Desyrel were profound - starting at 50mg_ I was able to sleep well_ but I cannot say it was the most restful sleep I've ever had. I could compare it to a somewhat high dosage of benedryl_ with similar anticholinergic effects being felt. Waking up was definitely more positive with this as opposed to self-medicating with benedryl_ as the waking experience with this drug has fewer noticable effects. Eventually_ it's eficiacy started to wane and I had to increase my dosage up to 200mg - it felt like I was becoming tolerant to it. When this happened_ I immediately stopped the medicine. In short_ this is a good medium term medicine that will not get you addicted_ and if no other methods are working for you and you want a non benzodiazepine treatment or a non atypical antipsychotic way of getting to sleep_ this is a good place to start.

It seems to put me to sleep pretty well most of the time. usually within 15 minutes or so. some nights i just lay there after taking it staring at the ceiling_ feeling numb_weird. Seems like that is happening more the longer i am on it. I have gained about 20lbs in 4 months and cant stop eating. have a hard time remember things that people have just told me. get dizzy if i don't eat with it. and if i don't get at least 8 hours of sleep after i take it i feel tired all day long and i could probably sleep all day. I would say if you just need a short term sleep aid try it. i think side effects worsen the longer you take it and the higher the dose. I plan to keep taking it. side effects are worth getting some sleep.,F,21,4  months,9/5/2009Email,Desyrel

I have taken it for years and have taken varying doses depending on my depressive cycle 50mg.-400mg.  Originally I was put on other drugs_ like Ambien (massive weight gain) and several other drugs that turned me into a zombie.  Desyrel has steadily been the answer for my depression.

I would wake up holding my arms and just crying_ I mean sobbing like a baby! I had no idea it might be this drug because I had been on it for 2 months and I didnt do anything to injure myself so I was just baffled by the arm pain. Then I started reading more about it and I realized that it causes muscle cramps_ I had no idea_ so I stopped the drug and the pain in my arms stopped too. Amazingly enough when I went back to my Dr he was confused and ha no idea that it would have that side effect on someone but I am sure thats what it was because when I stopped it_ the arm pain stopped too.

It worked great at first_ I think I started on it about a year ago - seriously I don't remember! I never had a great memory to begin with but it is terrible now. I get times when it goes blank for a few min also - it is scary. I took 50mg mainly for sleep and it helped a lot. But the last month or so the return of the 3AM wake up returned. Increaed to 75 mg and I seem to sleep one night_ then I don't - back and forth. When I do sleep I think it is from exhaustion_ and I still feel lousy all day.

This is a drug I will taper off of VERY slowly if I ever stop taking it.,I started Trazodone (400mg HS -- a whopping big dose) to help with insomnia and depression.  I did not notice that it virtually cured my migraines (from 3 a week to 4 a year).  After the depression lifted_ I started to taper off of the drug.

At least_ I did during my 10 waking hours. I was also sleeping 14 hours a day.  I'm mostly furious at my shrink for blowing me off_ misdiagnosing me_ and prescribing a medication  so utterly irresponsibly.

113, 2, chronic insomnia with anxiety,Titrated up from 25 to 100 mg. The first week was rough for me. I felt severe headache_ hot/cold sweats_ dizziness_extreme grogginess and loss of short term memory. after about two weeks the side effects went away mostly... except the memory loss. I already have a high sex drive_ so didn't notice a change. decided to stop taking the med cold turkey because after 2 months of taking it_ I still can't sleep through the night.,I think the effectiveness of medications depends on the person's profile and past experiences with drugs. I am desperately in search of curing my insomnia. It started when I got my first real job in a hospital. I am stressed all the time_ in fear of failure. I work early (6am)_ full time_ so it is difficult to experiment with different meds_ due to the lasting side effects in the morning. I feel like I'm stuck in the middle of a 25 lane freeway with traffic rushing by me a million miles an hour_ and I can't get out. Physicaly I don't have any problems. It realy sucks when you know your diagnosis is solely a mental one. I cann't escape my racing thoughts_ and my mind has now become a prison. I'm only 23_ and when I see blogs from people who have suffered insomnia for over 15 years_ its scares the hell out of me. Have considered trying restoril_ since I still have not had one good night's sleep in about a year. Would anyone like to talk about this with me?

Yes I sometimes forget the afternoon dose. But since I'm not sure if I need it_ it don't know if it matters. My irritability is less_ and I have not noticed the myriad symptoms others have. Perhaps you could talk to your doctor about multiple meds in lower dose for each.

It works well but in the past year I've not been able to take more than 50mg_ which isn't enough to help me much with sleep_ due to pain in my left kidney area. The MD seems to ignore my comments about this even though I've had infections in that kidney some years ago and have some mild bladder retention problems due to nerve damage.

117, 1, Depression,I was on Trazodone for a year or so due to long term depression (combination of hormones causing depression and child hood mental/physical abuse). The Trazodone knocked me out so I slept no problem as I had a 5 year sleeping problem. It solved that and made my depression alot better. BUT - my balance has never been right_ nor have I lost any of the weight gained_ and the worst thing is the memory. I feel like I have lost 90% of the words I knew before and have gone from being a very intelligent women (with 3 degrees) to having no concentration span_ and a constant blank mind. I have been off the drug for over 2 years now and feel I am left like this. This has made me more depressed than I ever was as my career is suffering as I can't really remember what I do at work and can't learn new things anymore.

I also feel that the lowest dosage (25mg p*day)does more for libido than the higher dosages. Now I'm able to orgasm again 3x a day like when I was younger. I couldn't do this whilst on 50 mg Trazodone. Traz doesn't really help for sleep_ not even on 100 mgs. So I went down and noticed improved libido.

146, 2, geriatric insomnia,fogginess_ memory loss_ ineffectiveness as sleep aid_ tired but still awake_ confusion_,My father was given trazodone with another med to keep him asleep nights after he got into the nursing home (he napped a lot during the day and wandered the house and watched tv nights after he retired) This nursing home wanted him to sleep when everyone else was asleep. It didn't work. The nursing home kept increasing his trazodone dose then added another anti-anxiety pill that ultimately sent him through the roof(yelling_ agitation_ hostile behavior_ etc). I insisted they take him off everything_ and now he is much better. He's taking melatonin and European sleep and anti-anxiety herbs and tinctures. Now he is sleeping 3-5 hours at a time nights without waking up constantly. That's a huge improvement in only a week.,M,88,9  months,1/7/2008Email,Desyrel

The only side effects were some difficulty waking & grogginess for awhile after waking. After being on 100mg/night it for years & doing some reasearch I realize I have gradually developed major memory problems & have so much trouble concentrating that my Dr. put me on amphetamines! I can't remember anything & it's begun to cause problems for me @ work. I always feel foggy & heavy-brained and need caffeine and/or prescribed amphetimines to help clear my head well enough for me to be able to function - and not even function as well as I used to. I've also experienced a recurrence of chronic_ sporadic flu-like symptoms; I'm forever feeling like I'm coming down with something -  I get a dull headache_ achy muscles & joints - but I don't get sick. I've wondered what super germs I've been fighting off for ages_ but apparently Trazodone can cause this_ as well.

I sleep so much better and dizziness & blurred vision are gone. Even at low dose it offers a small anti-anxiety affect_ and when 25 mg doesn't do it_ a small dose of added Xanax (half or fourth of pill) does the trick.

That was discontinued and I was put on a low dose of wellbutrin and the trazadone continued doing more damage.

After taking Trazadone_ I was able to sleep at least 6-8 hours; sometimes longer (just like when I was a child).  Desyrel helps me sleep more deeply.  Works best when taken just at bedtime_ but needs to be taken with small amount of food to avoid stomach upset especially for individuals with GERD or stomach ulcers.  Real stressful days and confrontation sometimes interferes with Trazadone's effectiveness. Also concentrating on television and reading cause my brain to be more wired and therefore Trazadone is less effective on these occasions. Non addictive.

198, 5, adjunct to meds/ocd/dep/anx,In the beginning experienced naseau upon taking it _ take with food it stops that effect. Great medication and used with my prozac and clonopin I have been GREAT!!! Give yourself the time to adjust .  Used to be on 400mg a day. Now 100mg.  Can't say enough good things. Sleep well_ No hang-over feeling.  A drug of many applications and relatively safe is MY EXPERIENCE ONLY!!!!!!!,,M,48,10  years,8/31/2006,Desyrel
199, 5, Chronic Insomnia,I had a terrible episode of insomnia about 6 years ago where I didn't sleep for probably two months. I went to a hypnotherapist and virtually tried everything and was at my wit's end when my doctor prescribed trazodone. It has been a lifesaver!! She prescribes 50 mg a night but I cut that into 1/4 tablet so I take approximately 12.5 mg a night and do not have a problem with sleeplessness. Occasionally_ I have to take another 12.5 mg but I don't have any wild dreams and no early morning grogginess. I basically have no side effects at all from this medication. I never want to be where I was before so I will continue taking this medication as I feel that it has saved my sanity!!,,F,45,6  years,8/28/2006,Desyrel
200, 5, Fibromyalgia syndrome,on high doses I lost my appetite. But I was able to go down to 75 mg.,It has been very effective for me for 15 years_ no bad side effects that I know of. It helps me sleep deeply (delta sleep_ not rem sleep) and my muscles heal and I have little or no pain from FMS.  I went on it slowly and it took several months to see the difference. At most I took maybe 225 mg and then tapered down to 75 or 50.,F,57,15  years,8/16/2006,Desyrel
201, 5, Difficulty falling/staying asleep,It took several months for my body to get used to it.  Before that_ I could never tell how I'd react to it.  Sometimes 50mg would lay me out in 15 minutes. Sometimes it wasn't quite enough and it would put me to sleep_ but keep me going into that early sleep cycle where you have odd_ vivid dreams. Other times it wouldn't do anything and after lying awake for an hour or two_ I'd have to get up and take some more. (For a brief time_ I took Ambien to help me fall asleep.) I now take 50mg Trazadone and sleep fine and feel good in the morning.  I'm a little more scatterbrained than I was before the meds_ but that could be due to the Trazodone or the Effexor XR_ which I started at the same time and take in the morning.,I used to think it was normal to wake up several times during the night and look at the clock.  Now_ I fall asleep fairly quickly_ sleep through the night_ and often don't wake up until my alarm clock goes off.  Some people think that having poor sleep when you're off the Trazodone is a sign of dependence_ but it's not if you're just going back to your pre-med sleep pattern.,F,37,2  years,7/15/2006,Desyrel

205, 4, insomnia/depression,dry mouth_ grogginess in the morning,Helps me get to sleep much faster_ if I am anxious I increase the dose by 25mg so I sleep through the night_ otherwise I wake up very early. Very minimal side effects.,F,17,9  months,4/17/2006,Desyrel

Received one-on-one therapy. I didn't want to take any drugs. Was diagnosed PTSD. Had another breakdown at 19. Received therapy and drugs. Tried Zoloft. Made me more moody.

Desyrel at 75mg at bedtime helps me get an uninterrupted night of sleep.THE DOWNSIDE ? If I don't let the medicine wear off with a full night's sleep_ I'd be like a zombie at work.

209, 5, depression,"At first vivid dreams_ knockout effect_ groggy in morning.  Now at 9 mo. I only have to deal with ""passing out"" (falling asleep suddenly) 2-6 hrs after dosing.  I wake up fine.",I was already taking Wellbutrin 450mg/day which helped motivation but only partially helped mood.  I quickly acclimated to increased doses of Trazodone until I hit 600mg/day_ where I am now.  Most doctors and nurses can't believe I can tolerate this dose.  The positive change with this combination was huge.  Since I had maxed out on Wellbutrin and Trazodone and still kept falling back into depression_ I recently began supplementing with Lamictal.  Too soon to tell about that.,M,44,9  months,2/26/2006,Desyrel
210, 5, insomnia,The only side effect I can possibly say is sometimes I get off and on tiredness during the day.  But that problem started a few months before I took Trazadone (but maybe I had it then because I wasn't getting enough sleep!).  Or my tiredness during the day could be because of anxiety.  So I don't know if Trazadone is to blame for that or not.  It is still worth it because I need to sleep!,I really don't know what I would have done without this medicine.  I take 50 mgs at night (sometimes 75mg if I'm really anxious or something is bothering me that night).  I was having panic attacks before this medicine because I would get so anxious before bedtime cause I could never sleep.  Now that I can sleep I don't have pannic attacks anymore.  It hasn't gotten rid of my anxiety but because I sleep I'm a less anxious person.  I am not saying this medicine is perfect but it is much better than alot of sleep aids because it doesn't have that addictive side effect that alot of them have..and it doesn't loose it's effect over time.  I am still taking the same dosage I started with.,F,23,2  days,2/9/2006Email,Desyrel

Couldn't sleep till after 3:30 AM and when I did_ had very frightening nightmares. Sensation of skin crawling.,My experience with this was so bad that I would under no circumstances EVER try it again. Called my MD and insisted he try something else.

Getting OFF of trazodone is absolutely miserable. I have tried to get off of it for about 8 months now_ but the withdrawal has been so bad that I've always ended up back on it. It causes anxiety_ agitation_ early-onset dreaming_ and some mild paranoia.,F,21,2.5  years,11/19/2005,Desyrel

220, 2, insomnia/bipolar,Severe long term memory loss. I don't remember anything about the year I took it. It seems I was functional_ I still see things I did at work during it (I'm a programmer_ so I can verify that the code I wrote during the time is in fact mine_ despite having no memory of writing it)_ people have remarked that I was a little zombie-ish and not quite myself during the time but mostly I kept going. I'm not sure what other effect I had_ if any_ since I can't really remember the time. My work seemed cohearent and sensible_ including written notes_ documentation_ comments_ etc so appearently I was functioning at least at 80%_ possibly 100. I've asked a few people if my short term memory during the time_ but (as I expected) they said that I was the most scatterbrained human alive_ before_ during and after. I'm inclined to concur_ while I usually have pretty good long term memory my short term memory has always been so bad that worsening it would be of no consequence.,Since I don't recall the period_ I'm not sure what to say. I did stay alive though_ which was by no means a given going in (I had attempted suicide before and was considered at great risk of going for it again). The functionallity is also significant as I wasn't particularly functional before_ or rather only functional in leaps and bounds rather then all the time. I'm not sure if the memory loss was worth it_ but I'm glad to still be alive none the less. Though I don't know how typical my experience is_ I'd recommend that you have a trusted third party monitor you and probe you a bit regarding your long term retention_ such as ask you about major events a few weeks or months back to make sure they're sticking. If my wife hadn't (after a year) started questioning if this was the right option I would still be on it and be none the wiser - I had no complaints at all during the time. Had she known what to look for_ I'm sure this could have been taken care of much more quickly and with no significant period of lost memory (a month or two rather then a year). Should this effect be absent_ I'd be all for this medicin.,M,30,1  years,8/16/2005Email,Desyrel

I feel like crap when I take this med.,I was needing to sleep because the Wellbutrin XL has the side effect of not sleeping.  I could not get the full effect of from the depression med when I was not sleeping.  My doc prescribed Desyrel 50-100mg every night before bed.  You saw the list of side effects.  I have 2 children under the age of 2 and I need to be rested to keep up with them during the day.  This drug did not do that for me.  If it works for you-good for you.  It does not work for me.  I would rather not sleep than feel like crap all day.,F,25,7  days,8/5/2005Email,Desyrel

224, 5, Severe insomnia_ depression,Memory loss_ loss of concentration_ weight gain_ loss of libido.,This drug saved my life. I would have killed myself if I hadn't been able to sleep. It definitely has side effects_ but instead of being six feet under_ I am now married and have a 3-year-old kid. I did take the drug while pregnant_ every day_ but I cut the dose back to 75 mg nightly while I carried my son. Although I hardly slept while pregnant_ and worried constantly about whether he would be affected by the drug_ he seems perfectly normal today as a 3 year old. As for the memory loss_ I write everything down. My computer at work is plastered in sticky notes. I send myself emails. I call my own voicemail to remind me to do things.

227, 4, insomnia,extreme fatigue in the morning and some throughout the day,I began taking this medicine for insomnia after quitting Remeron. While taking Remeron_ I gained weight_ suffered back pain_ and experienced considerable irritability. I like Desyrel much better because the side effects are minimal in comparison. I feel quite groggy in the morning after just 25mg at night_ however. Taking this with a light snack is crucial for its effectiveness for me; I didn't realize this at first because I was nauseous after quitting Remeron and did not want to eat. I plan to ask my psychiatrist if I can try a 12.5 mg dose and see if I can sleep through the night without morning grogginess.

Trazodone did help me to sleep but then getting up became a problem.I think it made me even more depressed_ and if I conotinued to take them I could have come addicted.

Either it made me sleepy or it freaked me out.  I was prescribed 75mg of Effexor and 100mg of Provigil.  I felt ok for about a day and then I felt like my skin was crawling.  I am still taking the Effexor_ which seems to help the anxiety and am taking 100mg of Desyrel at bedtime.

I feel like I shouldn't have taken the Trazadone_ I am not myself due to the fatigue and headache from it.  I tried it last month for a few days and finally went off of it because I was leaving for a trip to Hong Kong and Australia_ and didn't want to NOT feel my best.

240, 2, insomnia,Extreme drowsiness_ dizziness_ dry mouth_ poor concentration_ chronic nightmares_ morning-after,While Desyrel (otherwise known as Trazodone) did help me fall asleep_ its side effects are too much of a pay-up to bargain with.  The drowsy_ almost drunk feeling just after the pills set in was expected_ but the extremely frightening series of nightmares I experienced on a nightly basis were not.  My nearly non-existant dreamlife became so active and so disturbing upon taking this medication that I ended up requesting another medication from my psychiatrist.  It became apparent that taking the medicine was for naught when I awoke in a cold sweat numerous times every night because of such scary dreams.  My other complaint about Desyrel is the terrible hangover feeling I experienced every morning.  It was difficult to awaken_ and I was still quite sluggish_ dizzy_ and disoriented for at least an hour after rising.,F,20,4  months,11/30/2004,Desyrel
241, 5, chronic insomnia,None.  The very first time I tried it - originally for anxiety during a crisis - it came on so fast and strong and I was so unprepared for it that it caused a panic attack.  But later_ when I knew what to expect from the drug_ and was taking it only at night for insomnia_ the knock-me-senseless-with-a mallet effect was exactly what I was looking for.  Yet I have no morning hangover at all.  And unlike almost all other sleeping pills_ most of which belong to the benzodiazapine family of drugs which are quite addictive_ people taking trazodone tend not to have to increase their dose over time.  I take the same 50 mg dose I started on 3 years ago and it still works.,I've had insomnia for 10 years and before finding trazodone I tried every sleeping pill on the market with no success and many side effects.

257, 5, insomnia,I've been taking this for 7 years.  I only take 1/4 of a 25 mg pill and I sleep like a baby.  It takes effect within 15 minutes.  I've never had to increase my dose.  (If I take more I wake up with a headache that goes away quickly.)  I'm grateful for this drug because it is not addictive and I've never had to increase the dose.,,F,42,7  years,4/22/2004,Desyrel

267, 5, trouble sleeping on celexa,no side effects,I have GAD_ panic disorder with agoraphobia_ and social phobia.  I have always had trouble sleeping and once I started taking Celexa_ it got worse.  I didn't want to get off the Celexa but I NEEDED to sleep. Doc prescribed desyrel and it's like a godsend.  And it's not like xanax or valium_ so it's not as addictive.  I love it.,F,31,3  weeks,12/29/2002Email,Desyrel
268, 2, Insomnia (Caused by Zoloft),At first_ I experienced extreme grogginess in the morning and would be a sleepy zombie for a good chunk of the day.  After a few weeks I got used to it and was no longer groggy in the morning.  AND THEN I STARTED TO HAVE PSYCHOTIC-LIKE SYMPTOMS!!!  I had never experienced like that before.  When I stopped taking the trazadone_ the psychotic-like symptoms stopped within two days.,I was prescribed trazadone for insomnia caused by me taking Zoloft for OCD.  I do not have any other mental disorders and since the strange symptoms ceased_ as soon as I stopped the drug_ it was obviously the medicine that caused it.  I do NOT believe that this is a common reaction to trazadone but just a weird reaction my body had to it once it built up in my system.  I now take Restoril for sleep and have no side effects.  In my opinion_ trazadone is a decent sleeping pill but it just was not right for me_ in my case.  It was a scary experience and I hope to never experience it_ again.,M,26,7  weeks,11/17/2002,Desyrel
