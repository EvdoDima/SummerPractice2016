0, 3, adhd,Dry mouth_ bruxism resulting in multiple caps_ irritability at higher doses.,Initially_ when I started this drug 20 years ago_ there was no generic for the XR version and it was a life altering drug. I was on top of everything. Never had a bad day. When the generic came out of XR it was dissapointing at best_ so I switched to regular adderral. Don't be naive and think taking this drug long term won't have any consequences_ because it does. The artificial induction of stimulation from this drug eventually depletes your bodies reservoir in every way imaginable. I have chronic fatigue and rheumatoid arthritis after 20 years of using Adderral. True_ it may not be related_ but it feels exactly the way I felt when I would not take Adderral over the weekend. I could not move from the couch and had no ambition whatsoever. RA is the same thing only all the over exerting I did while on Adderral_ is suddenly apparent in my bones and joints. I am 50 and feel like I am 90. I still take 10 mg sometimes 2 x a day_ taking more does not improve my energy. Be warned. Relatively little good comes from this drug_ and the only gains are short lived.,F,50,20  years10 2X D,4/22/2016Email,"Dextroamp saccharate, amp aspartate, dextroamp sulfate and amp sulfate"
1, 4, ADHD_ Inability to focus,Initial Onset: Surge of focus / Enhanced awareness / High levels of motivation / Cerebral creativity / Energy IncreaseMid-Phase of Daily Dosage: Clenching of Jaws / Chewing or Sucking of Tongue / Anxiety at low levelsEnd-Phase of Daily Dosage: Continuation of Tongue sucking_ Jaw clenching_ malaise.,"This has been a wonderful tool for assisting me in maintaining focus and increasing my desire to accomplish tasks set before me_ yet it also increases my desire to over-achieve in areas which are not pertinent to daily tasks. Prior to this regimen I was constantly irritable_ and short-tempered_ yet while currently on this drug_ I am on an even plane. Occasionally I feel ""emotionally neutered"". Ampheta is an extremely addictive drug that can easily be abused and cause adverse conditions to the life of the individual if the regimen is not strictly followed. Sad story_ one of my friends is on the drug and takes his prescription amount within half of the allotted time given. Most of the time this person is sleeping for days_ or up for days. This would seem to be the life altering outcome that one would wish to avoid.",,37,2  years20 2X D,1/27/2012Email,"Dextroamp saccharate, amp aspartate, dextroamp sulfate and amp sulfate"
