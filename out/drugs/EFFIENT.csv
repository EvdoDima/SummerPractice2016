2, 1, Post stent placement,After having a stent placed in January 2015 the cardiologist placed me on Effient!  By September 14 I was diagnosed with colon cancer.  My research shows this is a highly suspect cause for colon cancer.  I do not recommend anyone take this drug!  I was the epitome of a compliant patient but that is the only thing that changed in my daily routine since January!,,M,57,9  months10,9/28/2015,Effient

6, 1, Stent,Severe nausea nearly 100% of the time.  Light headed.  brain fog_ dissiness.,I am expected to take this drug for a year but it has been completely disabling.  I am unable to function due to the severity of the side effects.  Even worse_ the severity has not decreased at all since starting to take this drug_ if anything the intensity of the side effects has become worse.,M,57,15  days10 MG 1X D,8/2/2014,Effient
7, 4, After 2 stents_ to prevent clotting,Some bruising_ occasional nosebleeds difficult to stop,Dr. started me on Plavix_ and tested clotting time a few weeks later.  Said I was one of a significant percentage for whom Plavix did not work well.  Given the choice of doubling Plavix or changing to Effient.  Saw the short list of problems with Effient and changing was a no-brainer.  Should have been on it in the first place since Effient works better with diabetics.  After about 3 months I changed from 10 mg to 5 mg_ and clotting test was still good.  The bruising got to where it was very minor.  I think testing to find a lower effective dose just makes sense with most drugs.I just went off Effient a few days ago after 19 or 20 months_ with the doctor's blessing.  He said don't bother to taper off so I just stopped.  No problems_ at least so far.,M,71,19  months5 mg 1X D,9/14/2013Email,Effient
8, 5, Plavix was not effective,Significant bruising_ even more than Plavix,I credit Effient with saving my life.  After a heart attack resulting in 2 stents_ and 2 additional stents placed in the next 15 months_ I read about Effient in the WSJ.  My Cardiologist agreed that we needed to give Effient a shot.,F,52,2.5  years10 mg 1X D,11/15/2012,Effient
9, 5, 4 stents_ atherosclerosis,Some large bruising when I first went onto Effient_ but over time that effect has greatly reduced.,Apparently my body didn't assimilate Plavix properly following my two 2008 stents_ so I ended up with a total blockage of a really main heart artery (a full MI) and so literally left Earth for a few minutes in April 2011. (BTW_ that's an  incredibly experience -- one both awesome and totally reaffirming that what we've taken to be true really IS.) Two more stents and a change to Effient seems to have done the trick so far. Energy  returned_ lung capacity normal_ good results.,F,64,14  months10 mg 1X D,6/30/2012Email,Effient

11, 4, 4 Stents placed,Major bruising on hands and arms - slight bump will cause large dark bruise that takes about 2 weeks to go away.

13, 4, After Stent Insertion,None_ except for the bruises which are mainly on my thighs.,I am satisfied to the degree that I donot know how effective this drug is.  While I have not had any problems_ I wasn't having any problems so to speak before my H A.  The only indication that I have according to the Dr. is the  bruise marks tell me that the drug is working.,F,68,10  months10 mg 1X D,12/31/2010Email,Effient
